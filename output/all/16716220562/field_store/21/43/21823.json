Your parent was very emphatic as to his intentions, and after this kind of thing,” and I pointed to the beautiful silver and the port, “how will you like roughing it in a hard world?”  “Don’t think I shall mind a bit; it would be rather a pleasant change. Also, even if my father doesn’t alter his mind, as he may, for he likes me at bottom because I resemble my dear mother, things ain’t so very bad. I have got some money that she left me, £6,000 or £7,000, and I’ll sell that ‘Odontoglossum Pavo’ for what it will fetch to Sir Joshua Tredgold--he was the man with the long beard who you tell me ran up Woodden to over £2,000--or failing him to someone else. I’ll write about it to-night. I don’t think I have any debts to speak of, for the Governor has been allowing me £3,000 a year, at least that is my share of the profits paid to me in return for my bullion-broking labours, and except flowers, I have no expensive tastes. So the devil take the past, here’s to the future and whatever it may bring,” and he polished off the glass of port he held and laughed in his jolly fashion.  Really he was a most attractive young man, a little reckless, it is true, but then recklessness and youth mix well, like brandy and soda.  I echoed the toast and drank off my port, for I like a good glass of wine when I can get it, as would anyone who has had to live for months on rotten water, although I admit that agrees with me better than the port.  “Now, Mr. Quatermain,” he went on, “if you have done, light your pipe and let’s go into the other room and study that Cypripedium of yours. I shan’t sleep to-night unless I see it again first. Stop a bit, though, we’ll get hold of that old ass, Woodden, before he turns in.”  “Woodden,” said his master, when the gardener had arrived, “this gentleman, Mr. Quatermain, is going to show you an orchid that is ten times finer than ‘O. Pavo!’”  “Beg pardon, sir,” answered Woodden, “but if Mr. Quatermain says that, he lies. It ain’t in Nature; it don’t bloom nowhere.”  I opened the case and revealed the golden Cypripedium. Woodden stared at it and rocked. Then he stared again and felt his head as though to make sure it was on his shoulders. Then he gasped.  “Well, if that there flower baint made up, it’s a MASTER ONE! If I could see that there flower ablowing on the plant I’d die happy.”  “Woodden, stop talking, and sit down,” exclaimed his master. “Yes, there, where you can look at the flower. Now, Mr. Quatermain, will you tell us the story of that orchid from beginning to end. Of course omitting its habitat if you like, for it isn’t fair to ask that secret. Woodden can be trusted to hold his tongue, and so can I.”  I remarked that I was sure they could, and for the next half-hour talked almost without interruption, keeping nothing back and explaining that I was anxious to find someone who would finance an expedition to search for this particular plant; as I believed, the only one of its sort that existed in the world.  “How much will it cost?” asked Mr. Somers.  “I lay it at £2,000,” I answered. “You see, we must have plenty of men and guns and stores, also trade goods and presents.”  “I call that cheap. But supposing, Mr. Quatermain, that the expedition proves successful and the plant is secured, what then?”  “Then I propose that Brother John, who found it and of whom I have told you, should take one-third of whatever it might sell for, that I as captain of the expedition should take one-third, and that whoever finds the necessary money should take the remaining third.”  “Good! That’s settled.”  “What’s settled?” I asked.  “Why, that we should divide in the proportions you named, only I bargain to be allowed to take my whack in kind--I mean in plant, and to have the first option of purchasing the rest of the plant at whatever value may be agreed upon.”  “But, Mr. Somers, do you mean that you wish to find £2,000 and make this expedition in person?”  “Of course I do. I thought you understood that. That is, if you will have me. Your old friend, the lunatic, you and I will together seek for and find this golden flower. I say that’s settled.”  On the morrow accordingly, it was settled with the help of a document, signed in duplicate by both of us.  Before these arrangements were finally concluded, however, I insisted that Mr. Somers should meet my late companion, Charlie Scroope, when I was not present, in order that the latter might give him a full and particular report concerning myself. Apparently the interview was satisfactory, at least so I judged from the very cordial and even respectful manner in which young Somers met me after it was over. Also I thought it my duty to explain to him with much clearness in the presence of Scroope as a witness, the great dangers of such an enterprise as that on which he proposed to embark. I told him straight out that he must be prepared to find his death in it from starvation, fever, wild beasts or at the hands of savages, while success was quite problematical and very likely would not be attained.  “_You_ are taking these risks,” he said.  “Yes,” I answered, “but they are incident to the rough trade I follow, which is that of a hunter and explorer. Moreover, my youth is past, and I have gone through experiences and bereavements of which you know nothing, that cause me to set a very slight value on life. I care little whether I die or continue in the world for some few added years. Lastly, the excitement of adventure has become a kind of necessity for me. I do not think that I could live in England for very long. Also I’m a fatalist. I believe that when my time comes I must go, that this hour is foreordained and that nothing I can do will either hasten or postpone it by one moment. Your circumstances are different. You are quite young. If you stay here and approach your father in a proper spirit, I have no doubt but that he will forget all the rough words he said to you the other day, for which indeed you know you gave him some provocation. Is it worth while throwing up such prospects and undertaking such dangers for the chance of finding a rare flower? I say this to my own disadvantage, since I might find it hard to discover anyone else who would risk £2,000 upon such a venture, but I do urge you to weigh my words.”  Young Somers looked at me for a little while, then he broke into one of his hearty laughs and exclaimed, “Whatever else you may be, Mr. Allan Quatermain, you are a gentleman. No bullion-broker in the City could have put the matter more fairly in the teeth of his own interests.”  “Thank you,” I said.  “For the rest,” he went on, “I too am tired of England and want to see the world. It isn’t the golden Cypripedium that I seek, although I should like to win it well enough. That’s only a symbol. What I seek are adventure and romance. Also, like you I am a fatalist. God chose His own time to send us here, and I presume that He will choose His own time to take us away again. So I leave the matter of risks to Him.”  “Yes, Mr. Somers,” I replied rather solemnly. “You may find adventure and romance, there are plenty of both in Africa. Or you may find a nameless grave in some fever-haunted swamp. Well, you have chosen, and I like your spirit.”  Still I was so little satisfied about this business, that a week or so before we sailed, after much consideration, I took it upon myself to write a letter to Sir Alexander Somers, in which I set forth the whole matter as clearly as I could, not blinking the dangerous nature of our undertaking. In conclusion, I asked him whether he thought it wise to allow his only son to accompany such an expedition, mainly because of a not very serious quarrel with himself.  As no answer came to this letter I went on with our preparations. There was money in plenty, since the re-sale of “O. Pavo” to Sir Joshua Tredgold, at some loss, had been satisfactorily carried out, which enabled me to invest in all things needful with a cheerful heart. Never before had I been provided with such an outfit as that which preceded us to the ship.  At length the day of departure came. We stood on the platform at Paddington waiting for the Dartmouth train to start, for in those days the African mail sailed from that port. A minute or two before the train left, as we were preparing to enter our carriage I caught sight of a face that I seemed to recognise, the owner of which was evidently searching for someone in the crowd. It was that of Briggs, Sir Alexander’s clerk, whom I had met in the sale-room.  “Mr. Briggs,” I said as he passed me, “are you looking for Mr. Somers? If so, he is in here.”  The clerk jumped into the compartment and handed a letter to Mr. Somers. Then he emerged again and waited. Somers read the letter and tore off a blank sheet from the end of it, on which he hastily wrote some words. He passed it to me to give to Briggs, and I could not help seeing what was written. It was: “Too late now. God bless you, my dear father. I hope we may meet again. If not, try to think kindly of your troublesome and foolish son, Stephen.”  In another minute the train had started.  “By the way,” he said, as we steamed out of the station, “I have heard from my father, who enclosed this for you.”  I opened the envelope, which was addressed in a bold, round hand that seemed to me typical of the writer, and read as follows:    “My Dear Sir,--I appreciate the motives which caused you to write   to me and I thank you very heartily for your letter, which shows   me that you are a man of discretion and strict honour. As you   surmise, the expedition on which my son has entered is not one   that commends itself to me as prudent. Of the differences between   him and myself you are aware, for they came to a climax in your   presence. Indeed, I feel that I owe you an apology for having   dragged you into an unpleasant"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51751"],["title","Oh, Rats!

By MIRIAM ALLEN DEFORD                            Illustrated by WOOD             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                     Galaxy Magazine December 1961.          Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                         Orthedrin, maxiton and glutamic                    acid--they were the prescription                    that made him king of his world!   SK540, the 27th son of two very ordinary white laboratory rats, surveyed his world.  He was no more able than any other rat to possess articulate speech, or to use his paws as hands. All he had was a brain which, relative to its size, was superior to any rat's that had hitherto appeared on Earth. It was enough.  In the first week of gestation his embryo had been removed to a more suitable receptacle than the maternal womb, and his brain had been stimulated with orthedrin, maxiton and glutamic acid. It had been continuously irrigated with blood. One hemisphere had been activated far in excess of the other, since previous experiments had shown that increased lack of symmetry between the hemispheres produced superior mentality. The end-result was an enormous increase in brain-cells in both hemispheres. His brain showed also a marked increase in cholinesterase over that of other rats.  SK540, in other words, was a super-rat.  The same processes had been applied to all his brothers and sisters. Most of them had died. The few who did not, failed to show the desired results, or showed them in so lopsided and partial a manner that it was necessary to destroy them.  All of this, of course had been mere preparation and experimentation with a view to later developments in human subjects. What SK540's gods had not anticipated was that they would produce a creature mentally the superior, not only of his fellow-rats, but also, in some respects, of themselves.  He was a super-rat: but he was still a rat. His world of dreams and aspirations was not human, but murine.  What would you do if you were a brilliant, moody young super-rat, caged in a laboratory?  SK540 did it.  What human beings desired was health, freedom, wealth, love, and power. So did SK540. But to him health was taken for granted; freedom was freedom from cages, traps, cats, and dogs; wealth meant shelter from cold and rain and plenty to eat; love meant a constant supply of available females.  But power! It was in his longing for power that he most revealingly displayed his status as super-rat.  Therefore, once he had learned how to open his cage, he was carefully selective of the companions--actually, the followers--whom he would release to join his midnight hegira from the laboratory. Only the meekest and most subservient of the males--intelligent but not too intelligent--and the most desirable and amiable of the females were invited.  Once free of the cages, SK540 had no difficulty in leading his troop out of the building. The door of the laboratory was locked, but a window was slightly open from the top. Rats can climb up or down.  Like a silver ribbon they flowed along the dark street, SK540, looking exactly like all the rest, at their head. Only one person in the deserted streets seems to have noticed them, and he did not understand the nature of the phenomenon.         *       *       *       *       *  Young Mr. and Mrs. Philip Vinson started housekeeping in what had once been a mansion. It was now a rundown eyesore.  It had belonged to Norah Vinson's great-aunt Martha, who had left it to her in her will. The estate was in litigation, but the executor had permitted the Vinsons to settle down in the house, though they weren't allowed yet to sell it. It had no modern conveniences, and was full of rooms they couldn't use and heavy old-fashioned furniture; but it was solidly built and near the laboratory where he worked as a technician, and they could live rent-free until they could sell the house and use the money to buy a real home.  \"Something funny happened in the lab last night,\" Philip reported, watching Norah struggle with dinner on the massive coal-stove. \"Somebody broke in and stole about half our experimental animals. And they got our pride and joy.\"  \"The famous SK540?\" Norah asked.  \"The same. Actually, it wasn't a break-in. It must have been an inside job. The cages were open but there were no signs of breaking and entering. We're all under suspicion till they find out who-dunit.\"  Norah looked alarmed.  \"You too? What on earth would anybody want with a lot of laboratory rats? They aren't worth anything, are they--financially, I mean?\"  \"Not a cent. That's why I'm sure one of the clean-up kids must have done it. Probably wanted them for pets. They're all tame, of course, not like wild rats--though they can bite like wild rats if they want to. Some of the ones missing are treated, and some are controls. It would just be a nuisance if they hadn't taken SK540. Now they've got to find him, or do about five years' work over again, without any assurance of as great a success. To say nothing of letting our super-rat loose on the world.\"  \"What on earth could even a super-rat do that would matter--to human beings, I mean?\"  \"Nobody knows. Maybe that's what we're going to find out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That night Norah woke suddenly with a loud scream. Philip got the gas lighted--there was no electricity in the old house--and held her shaking body in his arms. She found her breath at last long enough to sob: \"It was a rat! A rat ran right over my face!\"  \"You're dreaming, darling. It's because I told you about the theft at the lab. There couldn't be rats in this place. It's too solidly built, from the basement up.\"  He finally got her to sleep again, but he lay awake for a long time, listening. Nothing happened.  Rats can't talk, but they can communicate. About the time Norah Vinson dropped off after her frightened wakening, SK540 was confronting a culprit. The culprit was one of the liberated males. His beady eyes tried to gaze into the implacable ones of SK540, but his tail twitched nervously and if he bared his teeth it was more in terror than in fight. They all knew that strict orders had been given not to disturb the humans in the house until SK540 had all his preparations made.  A little more of that silent communication, and the rat who had run over Norah's face knew he had only two choices--have his throat slit or get out. He got.  \"What do you know?\" Philip said that evening. \"One of our rats came back.\"  \"By itself?\"  \"Yeah. I never heard of such a thing. It was one of the experimental ones, so it was smarter than most, though not such an awful lot. I never heard of a rat with homing instinct before. But when we opened up this morning, there he was, sitting in his cage, ready for breakfast.\"  \"Speaking of breakfast, I thought I asked you to buy a big box of oatmeal on your way home yesterday. It's about the only thing in the way of cereal I can manage on that old stove.\"  \"I did buy it. Don't you remember? I left it in the kitchen.\"  \"Well, it wasn't there this morning. All I know is that you're going to have nothing but toast and coffee tomorrow. We seem to be out of eggs, too. And bacon. And I thought we had half a pound left of that cheese, but that's gone too.\"  \"Good Lord, Norah, if you've got that much marketing to do, can't you do it yourself?\"  \"Sure, if you leave the car. I'm not going to walk all that way and back.\"  So of course Philip did do the shopping the next day. Besides, Norah had just remembered she had a date at the hairdresser's.         *       *       *       *       *  When he got home her hair was still uncurled and she was in hysterics. One of the many amenities great-aunt Martha's house lacked was a telephone; anyway, Norah couldn't have been coherent over one. She cast herself, shuddering and crying, into Philip's arms, and it was a long time before he got her soothed enough for her to gasp: \"Philip! They wouldn't let me out!\"  \"They? Who? What do you mean?\"  \"The--the rats! The white rats. They made a ring around me at the front door so I couldn't open it. I ran to the back and they beat me there and did the same thing. I even tried the windows but it was no use. And their teeth--they all--I guess I went to pieces. I started throwing things at them and they just dodged. I yelled for help but there's nobody near enough to hear. Then I gave up and ran in our bedroom and slammed the door on them, but they left guards outside. I heard them squeaking till you drove up, then I heard them run away.\"  Philip stared at her, scared to death. His wife had lost her mind.  \"Now, now, sweetheart,\" he said soothingly, \"let's get this straight. They fired a lab boy today. They found four of our rats in his home. He told some idiotic story of having 'found' them, with the others missing, running loose on the street that night, but of course he stole them. He must have sold the rest of them to other kids; they're working on that now.\"  Norah blew her nose and wiped her eyes. She had regained her usual calm.  \"Philip Vinson,\" she said coldly, \"are you accusing me of lying, or just of being crazy? I'm neither. I saw and heard those rats. They're here _now_. What's more, I guess I know where that oatmeal went, and the eggs and bacon too, and the cheese. I'm--I'm a hostage!  \"I don't suppose,\" she added sarcastically, \"that your SK540 was one of the ones they found in the boy's home?\"  \"No, it wasn't,\" he acknowledged uneasily. A nasty little icy trickle stole down his spine. \"All right, Norah, I give in. You take the poker and I'll take the hammer, and we'll search this house from cellar to attic.\"  \"You won't find them,\" said Norah bitterly. \"SK540's too smart. They'll stay inside the walls and keep quiet.\"  \"Then we'll find the holes they went through and rout them out.\"  They didn't, of course. There wasn't a sign "]]]
