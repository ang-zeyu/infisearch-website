It just sits there.\"  Tropile listened, marveling. To have seen a real Pyramid! Almost he had thought of them as legends, contrived to account for such established physical facts as the Eyes and Translation, as children with a Santa Claus. But this incredible man had seen it!  \"Somebody dropped an H-bomb on it, way back,\" Haendl continued, \"and the only thing that happened is that now the North Col is a crater. You can't move the Pyramid. You can't hurt it. But it's alive. It has been there, alive, for a couple of hundred years; and that's about all we know about the Pyramids. Right?\"  \"Right.\"  Haendl stood up. \"Tropile, that's what all of this is all about!\" He gestured around him. \"Guns, tanks, airplanes--we want to know more! We're going to find out more and then we're going to fight.\"  There was a jarring note and Tropile caught at it, sniffing the air. Somehow--perhaps it was his sub-adrenals that told him--this very positive, very self-willed man was just the slightest bit unsure of himself. But Haendl swept on and Tropile, for a moment, forgot to be alert.  \"We had a party up Mount Everest five years ago,\" Haendl was saying. \"We didn't find out a thing. Five years before that, and five years before _that_--every time there's a sun, while it is still warm enough to give a party a chance to climb up the sides--we send a team up there. It's a rough job. We give it to the new boys, Tropile. Like you.\"  There it was. He was being invited to attack a Pyramid.  Tropile hesitated, delicately balanced, trying to get the _feel_ of this negotiation. This was Wolf against Wolf; it was hard. There had to be an advantage--  \"There is an advantage,\" Haendl said aloud.  Tropile jumped, but then he remembered: Wolf against Wolf.  Haendl went on: \"What you get out of it is your life, in the first place. You understand you can't get out now. We don't want sheep meddling around. And in the second place, there's a considerable hope of gain.\" He stared at Tropile with a dreamer's eyes. \"We don't send parties up there for nothing, you know. We want to get something out of it. What we want is the Earth.\"  \"The Earth?\" It reeked of madness. But this man wasn't mad.  \"Some day, Tropile, it's going to be us against them. Never mind the sheep--they don't count. It's going to be Pyramids and Wolves, and the Pyramids won't win. And then--\"  It was enough to curdle the blood. This man was proposing to _fight_, and against the invulnerable, the godlike Pyramids.  But he was glowing and the fever was contagious. Tropile felt his own blood begin to pound. Haendl hadn't finished his \"and then--\" but he didn't have to. The \"and then\" was obvious: And then the world takes up again from the day the wandering planet first came into view. And then we go back to our own solar system and an end to the five-year cycle of frost and hunger.  And then the Wolves can rule a world worth ruling.  It was a meretricious appeal, perhaps, but it could not be refused. Tropile was lost.  He said: \"You can put away the gun, Haendl. You've signed me up.\"   VII  The way to Mount Everest, Tropile glumly found, lay through supervising the colony's nursery school. It wasn't what he had expected, but it had the advantages that while his charges were learning, he was learning, too.  One jump ahead of the three-year-olds, he found that the \"wolves,\" far from being predators on the \"sheep,\" existed with them in a far more complicated ecological relationship. There were Wolves all through sheepdom; they leavened the dough of society.  In barbarously simple prose, a primer said: \"The Sons of the Wolf are good at numbers and money. You and your friends play money games almost as soon as you can talk, and you can think in percentages and compound interest when you want to. Most people are not able to do this.\"  True, thought Tropile subvocally, reading aloud to the tots. That was how it had been with him.  \"Sheep are afraid of the Sons of the Wolf. Those of us who live among them are in constant danger of detection and death--although ordinarily a Wolf can take care of himself against any number of sheep.\" True, too.  \"It is one of the most dangerous assignments a Wolf can be given to live among the sheep. Yet it is essential. Without us, they would die--of stagnation, of rot, eventually of hunger.\"  It didn't have to be spelled out any further. Sheep can't mend their own fences.  The prose was horrifyingly bald and the children were horrifyingly--he choked on the word, but managed to form it in his mind--_competitive_. The verbal taboos lingered, he found, after he had broken through the barriers of behavior.  But it was distressing, in a way. At an age when future Citizens would have been learning their Little Pitcher Ways, these children were learning to fight. The perennial argument about who would get to be Big Bill Zeckendorf when they played a strange game called \"Zeckendorf and Hilton\" sometimes ended in bloody noses.  And nobody--nobody at all--meditated on Connectivity.  Tropile was warned not to do it himself. Haendl said grimly: \"We don't understand it and we don't like what we don't understand. We're suspicious animals, Tropile. As the children grow older, we give them just enough practice so they can go into one meditation and get the feel of it--or pretend to, at any rate. If they have to pass as Citizens, they'll need that much. But more than that we do not allow.\"  \"Allow?\" Somehow the word grated; somehow his sub-adrenals began to pulse.  \"_Allow!_ We have our suspicions and we know for a fact that sometimes people disappear when they meditate. We don't want to disappear. We think it's not a good thing to disappear. Don't meditate, Tropile. You hear?\"         *       *       *       *       *  But later, Tropile had to argue the point. He picked a time when Haendl was free, or as nearly free as that man ever was. The whole adult colony had been out on what they used as a parade ground--it had once been a football field, Haendl said. They had done their regular twice-a-week infantry drill, that being one of the prices one paid for living among the free, progressive Wolves instead of the dull and tepid sheep.  Tropile was mightily winded, but he cast himself on the ground near Haendl, caught his breath and said: \"Haendl--about meditation.\"  \"What about it?\"  \"Well, perhaps you don't really grasp it.\"  Tropile searched for words. He knew what he wanted to say. How could anything that felt as good as Oneness be bad? And wasn't Translation, after all, so rare as hardly to matter? But he wasn't sure he could get through to Haendl in those terms.  He tried: \"When you meditate successfully, Haendl, you're one with the Universe. Do you know what I mean? There's no feeling like it. It's indescribable peace, beauty, harmony, repose.\"  \"It's the world's cheapest narcotic,\" Haendl snorted.  \"Oh, now, really--\"  \"_And_ the world's cheapest religion. The stone-broke mutts can't afford gilded idols, so they use their own navels. That's all it is. They can't afford alcohol; they can't even afford the muscular exertion of deep breathing that would throw them into a state of hyperventilated oxygen drunkenness. Then what's left? Self-hypnosis. Nothing else. It's all they can do, so they learn it, they define it as pleasant and good, and they're all fixed up.\"  Tropile sighed. The man was so stubborn! Then a thought occurred to him and he pushed himself up on his elbows. \"Aren't you leaving something out? What about Translation?\"  Haendl glowered at him. \"That's the part we don't understand.\"  \"But surely self-hypnosis doesn't account for--\"  \"Surely it doesn't!\" Haendl mimicked savagely. \"All right. We don't understand it and we're afraid of it. Kindly do not tell me Translation is the supreme act of Un-willing, Total Disavowal of Duality, Unison with the Brahm-Ground or any such slop. You don't know what it is and neither do we.\" He started to get up. \"All we know is, people vanish. And we want no part of it, so we don't meditate. None of us--including you!\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was foolishness, this close-order drill. Could you defeat the unreachable Himalayan Pyramid with a squads-right flanking maneuver?  And yet it wasn't all foolishness. Close-order drill and 2500-calorie-a-day diet began to put fat and flesh and muscle on Tropile's body, and something other than that on his mind. He had not lost the edge of his acquisitiveness, his drive--his whatever it was that made the difference between Wolf and sheep.  But he had gained something. Happiness? Well, if \"happiness\" is a sense of purpose, and a hope that the purpose can be accomplished, then happiness. It was a feeling that had never existed in his life before. Always it had been the glandular compulsion to gain an advantage, and that was gone, or anyway almost gone, because it was permitted in the society in which he now lived.  Glenn Tropile sang as he putt-putted in his tractor, plowing the thawing Jersey fields. Still, a faint doubt remained. Squads right against the Pyramids?  Stiffly, Tropile stopped the tractor, slowed the diesel to a steady _thrum_ and got off. It was hot--being midsummer of the five-year calendar the Pyramids had imposed. It was time for rest and maybe something to eat.  He sat in the shade of a tree, as farmers always have done, and opened his sandwiches. He was only a mile or so from Princeton, but he might as well have been in Limbo; there was no sign of any living human but himself. The northering sheep didn't come near Princeton--it \"happened\" that way, on purpose.  He caught a glimpse of something moving, but when he stood up for a better look into the woods on the other side of the field, it was gone. Wolf? _Real_ Wolf, that is? It could have been a bear, for that matter--there was talk of wolves and bears around Princeton; and although"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],["title","The Rat Race (#0)"],["body","RAT RACE                              by JAY FRANKLIN            The Astonishing Narrative of a Man Who Was Somebody        Else ...

Commander Frank Jacklin returns to consciousness in New York and is shocked to find himself in the body of Winnie Tompkins, a dissolute stock-broker. Unable to explain his real identity, Jacklin attempts to fit into Tompkins' way of life. Complications develop when Jacklin gets involved with Tompkins' wife, his red-haired mistress and his luscious secretary. Three too many women for Jacklin to handle. His foreknowledge of the Alaska sinking and other top secret matters plunges him into a mad world of intrigue and excitement in Washington--that place where anything can happen and does! Where is the real Tompkins is a mystery explained in the smashing climax.  Completely delightful, wholly provocative, the Rat Race is a striking novel of the American Scene.     CHAPTER 1   When the bomb exploded, U.S.S. Alaska, was steaming westward, under complete radio silence, somewhere near the international date-line on the Great Circle course south of the Aleutian Islands.  It was either the second or the third of April, 1945, depending on whether the Alaska, the latest light carrier to be added to American naval forces in the Pacific, had passed the 180th meridian.  I was in the carrier, in fact in the magazine, when the blast occurred and I am the only person who can tell how and why the Alaska disappeared without a trace in the Arctic waters west of Adak. I had been assigned by Navy Public Relations to observe and report on Operation Octopus--the plan to blow up the Jap naval base at Paramushiro in Kuriles with the Navy's recently developed thorium bomb.  My name, by the way, is Frank Jacklin, Lieutenant-Commander, U.S.N.R. I had been commissioned shortly after Pearl Harbor, as a result of my vigorous editorial crusade on the Hartford (Conn.) Courant to Aid America by Defending the Allies. I was a life-long Republican and a personal friend of Frank Knox, so I had no trouble with Navy Intelligence in getting a reserve commission in the summer of 1940. (I never told them that I had voted for Roosevelt twice, so I was never subjected to the usual double-check by which the Navy kept its officer-corps purged of subversive taints and doubtful loyalties.) So I had a first-rate assignment, by the usual combination of boot-licking and \"yessing\" which marks a good P.R.O.  It was on the first night in Jap waters, after we had cleared the radius of the Naval Air Station at Adak, that Professor Chalmis asked me to accompany him to the magazine. He said that his orders were to make effective disclosure of the mechanics of the thorium bomb as soon as we were clear of the Aleutians. Incidentally, he, I and Alaska's commander, Captain Horatio McAllister, U.S.N., were the only people aboard who knew the real nature of Operation Octopus. The others had been alerted, via latrine rumor, that we were engaged in a sneak-raid on Hokkaido.  The thorium bomb, Chalmis told me, had been developed by the Navy, parallel to other hitherto unsuccessful experiments conducted by the Army with uranium. The thorium bomb utilized atomic energy, on a rather low and inefficient basis by scientific standards, but was yet sufficiently explosive to destroy a whole city. He proposed to show me the bomb itself, so that I could describe its physical appearance, and to brief me on the mechanics of its detonation, leaving to the Navy scientists at Washington a fuller report on the whole subject of atomic weapons. He had passes, signed by Captain McAllister, to admit us to the magazine and proposed, after supper, that we go to examine his gadget.  It was cold as professional charity on the flight-deck, with sleet driving in from the northwest as the icy wind from Siberia hit the moist air of the Japanese Current. There was a nasty cross-sea and the Alaska was wallowing and pounding as she drove towards Paramushiro at a steady 30 knots.  \"You know, Jacklin,\" said Chalmis, as the Marine sentry took our passes and admitted us to the magazine, \"I don't like this kind of thing.\"  \"You mean this war?\" I asked, noticing irrelevantly the way the electric light gleamed on his bald head.  \"I mean this thorium bomb,\" he replied. \"I had most to do with developing it and now in a couple of days one of these nice tanned naval aviators at the mess will take off with it and drop it on Paramushiro from an altitude of 30,000 feet. The timer is set to work at an altitude of 500 feet and then two or three thousand human beings will cease to exist.\"  \"The Japs aren't human,\" I observed, quoting the Navy.  Chalmis looked at me in a strange, staring way.  \"Thank you, Commander,\" he said. \"You have settled my problem. I was in doubt as to whether to complete this operation in the name of scientific inquiry, but now I see I have no choice. See this!\" he continued.  \"This\" was a spherical, finned object of aluminum about the size of a watermelon, resting on a gleaming chromium-steel cradle.  \"If I take this ring, Jacklin,\" Chalmis remarked, \"and pull it out, the bomb will explode within five seconds or at 500 feet altitude whichever takes longer. The five seconds is to give the pilot a margin of safety in case of accidental release at low altitude. However, dropping it from 30,000 feet means that the five seconds elapse before the bomb reaches the level at which it automatically explodes.\"  \"You make me nervous, Professor,\" I objected. \"Can't you explain without touching it?\"  \"If it exploded now, approximately twenty-four feet below the water-line,\" Chalmis continued, \"it would create an earthquake wave which could cause damage at Honolulu and would register on the seismograph at Fordham University.\"  \"I'll take your word for it,\" I said.  \"So,\" concluded Chalmis, \"if the bomb were to go off now, no one could know what had happened to the Alaska and the Navy--as I know the Navy--would decide that thorium bombs were impractical, too dangerous to use. And so the human race might be spared a few more years of life.\"  \"Stop it!\" I ordered, lunging forward and grabbing for his arm.  But it was too late. Chalmis gave a strong pull on the ring. It came free and a slight buzzing sound was heard above the whine of the turbines and the thud of the seas against Alaska's bow.  \"You--\" I began. Then I started counting: \"Three--four--fi--\"....         *       *       *       *       *  There was a hand on my shoulder and a voice that kept saying, \"Snap out of it!\" I opened bleary eyes to see a familiar figure in uniform bending over me. My head ached, my mouth tasted dry and metallic, and I felt strangely heavy around the middle.  \"Hully, Ranty,\" I said. \"Haven't seen you since Kwajalein. What's the word? What happened to the Alaska?\"  Commander Tolan, U.S.N.R., who had been in my group in Quonset, straightened up with a laugh. \"When were you ever at Kwajalein, Winnie?\" he asked. \"And what's the drip about the Alaska?\"  \"You remember,\" I said. \"That time we went into the Marshalls with the Sara in forty-three. But what happened to my ship? There was a bomb.... Say, where am I and what day is it anyway?\"  There was a burst of laughter from across the room and I turned my head. I seemed to be sitting in a deep, leather arm-chair in a small, nicely furnished bar, with sporting-prints on the wall and a group of three clean-shaven, only slightly paunchy middle-aged men, who looked like brokers, standing by the rail staring at me. Tolan was the only man in uniform. These couldn't be doctors and what were civilians doing in mess....  \"We blew up!\" I insisted. \"Chalmis said....\"  \"You've been dreaming, Winnie,\" drawled one of the brokerish trio. \"You were making horrible noises in your sleep so Ranty went over and woke you up.\"  \"If you want to know where you are,\" remarked another, \"you're in the bar of the Pond Club on West 54th Street, as sure as your name is Winfred S. Tompkins and this is April 2nd, 1945.\"  \"Winnie Tompkins!\" I exclaimed. \"Why I once knew him quite well. He and I were at St. Mark's together, then he went to Harvard and Wall Street while I went to Yale and broke, so we didn't see much of each other after the depression.\"  \"It's a good gag, Winnie,\" Tolan laughed, \"but now you've had your fun, how about another drink?\"  I shook my head. \"Listen, Ranty,\" I begged. \"Tell me what happened. I can take it. Are you dead? Are we all dead? Is this supposed to be heaven? What's the word?\"  \"That joke's played out,\" said Tolan. \"Here, Tammy, another Scotch and soda for Mr. Tompkins. A double one.\"  Tompkins! My head ached. I stood up and walked across the room to study my reflection in the mirror behind the bar. Instead of my painfully familiar freckled face and skinny frame, I saw a red, full jowled face with bags beneath the"]]]
