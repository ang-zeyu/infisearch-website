I wouldn't worry much about it, Fred. Modern Terran drugs--\"  \"--might not even touch this stuff. Open one of those tubes!\"  \"But, Fred,\" Carver objected, \"we have so little of it. Besides--\"  \"To hell with that,\" Fred said. He took one of the tubes and uncorked it with his teeth.  \"Wait, Fred!\"  \"Wait, nothing!\"  Fred drained the contents of the tube and flung it down. Carver said testily, \"I was merely going to point out that the serum should be tested before an Earthman uses it. We don't know how it'll react on a human. It was for your own good.\"  \"Sure it was,\" Fred said mockingly. \"Just look at how the stuff is reacting.\"  The blackened wound had turned flesh-colored again and was sealing. Soon there was a line of white scar tissue. Then even that was gone, leaving firm pink flesh beneath.  \"Pretty good, huh?\" Fred gloated, with a slight touch of hysteria. \"It works, Professor, it works! Drink one yourself, pal, live another sixty years. Do you suppose we can synthesize this stuff? Worth a million, worth ten million, worth a billion. And if we can't, there's always good old Loray. We can drop back every fifty years or so for a refill. The stuff even tastes good, Professor. Tastes like--what's wrong?\"  Professor Carver was staring at Fred, his eyes wide with astonishment.  \"What's the matter?\" Fred asked, grinning. \"Ain't my seams straight? What you staring at?\"  Carver didn't answer. His mouth trembled. Slowly he backed away.  \"What the hell is wrong!\" Fred glared at Carver. Then he ran to the spaceship's head and looked in the mirror.  \"_What's happened to me?_\"  Carver tried to speak, but no words came. He watched as Fred's features slowly altered, smoothed, became blank, rudimentary, as though nature had drawn there a preliminary sketch of intelligent life. Strange knobs were coming out on Fred's head. His complexion was changing slowly from pink to gray.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I told you to wait,\" Carver sighed.  \"_What's happening?_\" asked Fred in a frightened whimper.  \"Well,\" Carver said, \"it must all be residual in the sersee. The Lorayan birth-rate is practically nonexistent, you know. Even with the sersee's healing powers, the race should have died out long ago. Unless the serum had another purpose as well--the ability to change lower animal forms into the Lorayan form.\"  \"That's a wild guess!\"  \"A working hypothesis based upon Deg's statement that sersee is the mother of the Lorayan people. I'm afraid that is the true meaning of the beast cults and the reason they are taboo. The various beasts must be the origins of certain portions of the Lorayan people, perhaps all the Lorayan people. Even the topic is taboo; there clearly is a deep-seated sense of inferiority about their recent step up from bestiality.\"  Carver rubbed his forehead wearily. \"The sersee juice has,\" he continued, \"we may hazard, a role-sharing in terms of the life of the race. We may theorize--\"  \"To hell with theory,\" Fred said, and was horrified to find that his voice had grown thick and guttural, like a Lorayan voice. \"Professor, do something!\"  \"There's nothing I can do.\"  \"Maybe Terran science--\"  \"No, Fred,\" Carver said quietly.  \"_What?_\"  \"Fred, please try to understand. I can't bring you back to Earth.\"  \"What do you mean? You must be crazy!\"  \"Not at all. How can I bring you back with such a fantastic story? They would consider the whole thing a gigantic hoax.\"  \"But--\"  \"Listen to me. No one would believe! They would consider, rather, that you were an unusually intelligent Lorayan. Your very presence, Fred, would undermine the whole thesis of my book!\"  \"You can't leave me,\" Fred said. \"You just can't do that.\"  Professor Carver still had both revolvers. He stuck one in his belt and leveled the other.  \"I am not going to endanger the work of a lifetime. Get out, Fred.\"  \"No!\"  \"I mean it. Get out, Fred.\"  \"I won't! You'll have to shoot me!\"  \"I will if I must,\" Carver assured him. \"I'll shoot you and throw you out.\"  He took aim. Fred backed to the port, undogged it, opened it. The villagers were waiting quietly outside.  \"What will they do to me?\"  \"I'm really sorry, Fred,\" Carver said.  \"I won't go!\" Fred shrieked, gripping the edges of the port with both hands.  Carver shoved him into the waiting hands of the crowd and threw the remaining tubes of sersee after him. Then, quickly, not wishing to see what was going to happen, he sealed the port.  Within an hour, he was leaving the planet's atmospheric limits.         *       *       *       *       *  When he returned to Earth, his book, _Underlying Causes of the Implicit Inferiority of Non-Terran Peoples_, was hailed as a milestone in comparative anthropology. But he ran into some difficulty almost at once.  A space captain named Jones returned to Earth and maintained that, on the planet Loray, he had discovered a native who was in every significant way the equal of a Terran. And he had tape recordings and motion pictures to prove it.  Carver's thesis seemed in doubt for some time, until Carver examined the evidence for himself. Then he pointed out, with merciless logic, that the so-called super-Lorayan, this paragon of Loray, this supposed equal of Terran humanity, occupied the lowest position in the Lorayan hierarchy, the position of Sweeper, clearly shown by the broad black stripe across his face.  The space captain admitted that this was true.  Why then, Carver thundered, was this Lorayan Superior not able, in spite of his so-called abilities, to reach any higher position in the debased society in which he dwelt?  The question silenced the space captain and his supporters, demolished the entire school, as a matter of fact. And the Carverian Doctrine of the Implicit Inferiority of Non-Terrans is now accepted by reasoning Terrans everywhere in the Galaxy."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51547"],["title","The Story of the Airship (Non-rigid) (#0)"],["body","Story of                               THE AIRSHIP                               (NON-RIGID)          _A Study of One of America’s Lesser Known Defense Weapons_                               BY HUGH ALLEN      [Illustration: Airship in flight]                             AKRON, OHIO, 1943      [Illustration: ADMIRAL W.

LITCHFIELD     An industrial leader, chairman of the Goodyear board, who has     believed for 30 years that airships would prove useful to his     country in peace or war]     Foreword   High admirals of the American fleet faced in 1940 the gravest responsibility in the National Defense the Navy had ever known. Wherever they turned, north, east, south, west, perils lurked. If they swung their binoculars toward Iceland, toward the Caribbean, toward Singapore, Alaska, or the Canal, everywhere waited potential threats against our American way of life, which they must meet with ships and men, with guns and stout hearts. This was not merely national defense, perhaps not even hemisphere defense, it was World War.  Surveying their gigantic task, and moving swiftly to meet it, they found a place in their program for half forgotten craft, long over-shadowed by other arms of the fleet, the non-rigid airship, sometimes called a dirigible, but more often a “blimp.”  Couldn’t the airship be used as a watchdog along the coast, against enemy submarines, in discovering enemy mines—relieve for sterner tasks the destroyers and other craft now wallowing their innards out in those restless shallow waters? Great Britain and France had used airships effectively in this service over the English Channel during the last war.  The areas within their patrol range, a hundred or 200 miles out to sea, within the 100 fathom curve, was a vital one. There steamship lanes converge, great harbors lie, coastwise merchantmen cruise, there is the greatest concentration of military and commercial shipping.  With depth bombs and machine guns the blimps might strike a stout blow of their own, even if they weren’t rated as combat craft. At least they could sound the alarm, call out reinforcements from swift moving shore-based craft, keep the intruder under surveillance. After all the main thing was to find the submarines in those endless miles of water. And in this field the very slowness of the airship, as compared to the airplane, would be an advantage, permit a more thorough search of the ocean’s surface, while its speed as compared to any man-of-war, would enable it to cover more ground within a given 24 hours.  So on the Navy’s recommendation Congress in 1940 approved the building of the airship fleet up to substantial proportions, together with bases from which they might operate along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. That program is now being put into effect and the Goodyear company which had built most of the airships used in the first World War, began again to build ships.  The story of the great rigid airships, the Los Angeles, the Akron, Macon and Graf Zeppelin is fairly well known. That of the smaller non-rigids is less familiar. The larger airships still hold vital commercial and military promise for the future. However, this book will confine itself to the non-rigid airship, with only enough reference to the larger ships to round out the picture.  Every new vehicle of combat or transport has had to fight its way to acceptance against misunderstanding and lack of understanding. Steamships had to prove themselves against sailing ships. Submarines had an uphill battle to establish themselves. The airplane was long on probation, and now the airship is on trial.  This book will tell something about these ships, cite what is claimed for them and what has been reasonably proved they can do, see what progress has been made in performance, and point out what may be expected from them hereafter—not avoiding the moot question of vulnerability.  Lighter-than-air is older by a century than the heavier-than-air branch of aeronautics. Its history is marked by long research and experiment and continued progress. Like every pioneering development it has had its setbacks. But the sincerity of the effort and solid accomplishment made, entitles the project to thoughtful consideration.

These activities were overshadowed at the time by graver events, or hidden by military secrecy. Few people even today know that ships were sunk and men killed by German U-boats within sight of our coast.[1]  It was in no sense an all-out effort. Only a handful of submarines were used. The attack was launched late in the war, in fact one of the six didn’t even reach American waters, was called back by news of the Armistice. Submarines of that day had a cruising range of some three months, could spend only three weeks in our coastal waters, used the rest of the time getting over and back.  But in those few weeks these six submarines destroyed exactly 100 ships, of all sizes, types and registry, killed 435 people. Most of the ships were peaceful unarmed merchantmen, coastwise ships from the West Indies and South America, tankers from Galveston, fishing ships"]]]
