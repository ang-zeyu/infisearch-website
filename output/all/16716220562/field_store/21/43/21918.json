They say if you--if we--are so smart, why do we use hax or the chains like anybody else? They think somebody else must have given us the starships, or else we stole them. That's mostly Piq's idea; he's the village lawyer and, of course, lawyers are apt to think in terms like that.\"  \"Um,\" the colonel said. \"We didn't think it would be a good idea to introduce ground cars. Upset their traffic and cause dissatisfied yearnings.\"  \"They're satisfied with their hax carts. They're not in any hurry to get anywhere. But Katund's a village. Attitudes may be different in the cities.\"  \"You stick with your village, old chap. If you feel a wild urge for city life, you can always take a weekend trip to Zrig. Stay at the Zrig Grasht; it's the only decent inn. By the way, you spoke of a landlady. Do you mean at the inn?\"  No, Clarey told him, at first he had put up at the inn, but he found the place noisy, the cooking poor, and the pallet covers dirty. Besides, Hanxi had kept importuning him to go on visits to a nearby township where he promised him a good time.  \"I was wondering, though,\" Clarey finished, \"if it would be possible for an Earthman and a Damorlant to--er--have a good time together.\"  \"Been wondering myself!\" the colonel said eagerly. \"I didn't dare ask on my own behalf, but it's your job, isn't it? I'll check back with the X-T boys on Earth. Go on with your story.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As a resident of the inn, Clarey told Colonel Blynn, he'd found that he was expected to join the men in the bar parlor every evening, where they'd drink and exchange appropriate stories. But he'd choked on the squfur and was insufficiently familiar with the local mores to be able to appreciate the stories, let alone tell any. He'd concentrated on smiling and agreeing with whatever anybody said, with the result that the others began to agree with Piq that he was a bit cracked. \"They were, for the most part, polite enough to me, but I could sense the gulf. I was a stranger, a city man, and probably a bit of a lunatic.\"  A few of the younger ones hadn't even been polite. \"They used to insult me obliquely,\" Clarey went on, \"and whisper things I only half-heard. I pretended I didn't hear at all. I stood them drinks and told them what a lovely place Katund was, so much cleaner and prettier and friendlier than the city. That just seemed to confirm their impression that I was an idiot.\"  He stopped, took a sip of tea, and continued, \"The females were friendly enough, though. Every time they came into the library they'd always stop for a chat. And they were very hospitable--invited me to outdoor luncheons, temple gatherings, things like that. Embelsira--she's the chief librarian--got quite annoyed because she said they made so much noise when they all gathered round my desk.\"  He paused and blushed. \"I have an idea that--well, the ladies don't find me unattractive. I mean they're not really ladies. That is, they're perfect ladies; they're just not women.\"  \"I'm not a bit surprised,\" the colonel nodded sagely. \"Very well-set-up young fellow for a native--only natural they should take a liking to you. And only natural the men shouldn't.\"  Clarey gave an embarrassed grin. \"One evening I was sitting in the bar-parlor, talking to Kuqal and Gazmor, two of the older men. And then Mundes came in; he's the town muscle boy. You know the type--one in every tri-di series. He was rather unpleasant. I pretended to think he was joking. I've learned to laugh like one of them. Listen.\" He gave a creditable imitation of an agonized turshi.         *       *       *       *       *  The colonel shuddered. \"I'm sure if anything would convince the chaps back on Earth that the Damorlanti aren't human, that would do it. What then?\"  \"Finally he made a remark impugning the virility of librarians that I simply could not ignore, so I emptied my mug of squfur in his face.\"  \"Stout fellow!\"  \"I knew he'd attack me and probably beat me up, but I thought that perhaps if I put up a show of courage they'd respect me. There was something like that in _Sentries of the Sky_ a year or so ago--but of course you'd have missed that episode; you were up here. Anyhow, as I expected, he hit me. And then I hit him....\" He smiled reminiscently into his cup of tea.  \"And then?\"  \"I beat him,\" Clarey said simply. \"I still can't figure out how I did it. I think it must be because my muscles are heavier-gravity type.\" He smiled again. \"And I beat him good. He couldn't dance at the temple for weeks.\"  The colonel's jaw dropped. \"He's a temple dancer?\"  \"Chief temple dancer. I was a little worried about that, because I didn't want to get in bad theologically. So I went to the priest and apologized for any inconvenience I might have caused. He said not to worry; Mundes had had it coming to him for a long time and his one regret was that he hadn't been there to see it. Then we touched toes and he said he liked to see a young fellow with brawn who also took an interest in cultural pursuits like reading. He trusted I'd have a beneficial effect on the youth of the village. And then he asked me to fill in for Mundes as chief temple dancer until he--ah--recovered. It's a great honor, you know!\" he said sharply, as the colonel seemed more moved to mirth than awe. \"But I've never been much of a dancing man and that's what I told him.\"  \"Very well done,\" the colonel said approvingly. \"But you still haven't explained where you got lodgings and a landlady.\"  \"She's Embelsira's mother. I was invited over for dinner from time to time.... It's a local custom,\" he explained as Blynn's eyebrows went up. \"So, when Embelsira told me her mother happened to have a compartment to let with meals included, I jumped at it. Blynn, you really ought to taste those pastries of hers!\"  The colonel managed to divert him onto some of the other aspects of Katundut life. When he'd finished taping everything he had to say, the colonel gave him a list of artifacts and small-sized flora and fauna the specialists on Earth wanted him to collect for his next trip, providing he could do so without arousing attention or violating tabus.  They shook hands. \"Clarey,\" the colonel said, \"you've done splendidly. Earth will be proud of you. And you might bring along one or two of those pastries, by the way.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When Clarey got back to Katund, Embelsira and her mother gave a little welcome home party for him. \"Nothing elaborate,\" the widow said. \"Just a few neighbors and friends, some simple refreshments.\"  The tiny residential dome was packed with people; the refreshments, Clarey thought, as he munched industriously, were magnificent. But then he'd been forced to live on Earth food for a weekend, so he was no judge.  After they'd finished eating, the young people folded the furniture, and, while one of the boys played upon a curious instrument that was string and percussion and brass all at once, the others danced.  Clarey made no attempt to participate. In his early youth, he'd flopped at the Earth hops--and the Damorlanti had a distinctly more Dionysian culture than his home world. He stood and watched them leaping and twirling. When they'd dropped, temporarily exhausted, he made his way over to the musician, whom he recognized as one of Piq's numerous grandsons; this one was Rini, he thought.  \"Is that difficult to learn?\" he asked, touching the instrument.  \"The ulerin is extremely difficult,\" the boy said importantly. \"It takes years and years of practice. And you've got to have the touch to begin with. Not many do. All our family have the touch, my brother Irik most of all. He's in Barshwat, studying to be a famous musician.\"  Clarey looked at the ulerin with unmistakable wistfulness.  \"Care to try it?\" the boy asked. \"But, mind, you have to pay for any bladders you burst.\"  \"I shall be very careful,\" Clarey said, taking the instrument reverently in his hands. He had never touched a musical instrument before--an Earth instrument would have been no less unfamiliar, no more wonderful. Gently he began to pluck and bang and blow, in imitation of the way the boy had done, and, though the sounds that came out didn't have the same smoothness, still they didn't fall harshly on his ears. The others stopped talking and listened; it would have been difficult for them to do otherwise, as he was unable to find the muting device.  \"Sounds like the death wail of a hix,\" Piq sibilated, but he added grudgingly, \"Foreigner or not, I have to say this for him--he's got the touch.\"  \"Yes, he's got the touch,\" others agreed. \"You always can tell.\"  Rini smiled at Clarey. \"I believe you do. I'll teach you to play, if you like.\"  \"I would, very much.\" Clarey was about to offer to pay for the lessons; then he remembered that, though this would have been the right thing on Earth, it would be wrong on Damorlan. \"If it is not too much trouble,\" he finished.  \"It's the kind of trouble I like.\" The boy twisted his nose at Clarey. \"Sometime you can hide the reserved books for me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After the guests had gone, Clarey insisted on helping the women with the putting away. \"Well, as long as Embelsira has a pair of brawny arms to help her,\" the widow yawned, \"I might as well be getting along to my pallet. I seem to get more and more tired these days--old age, I expect. One day I'll be so tired I'll never wake up and Embelsira'll be alone and what'll she do, poor thing? Who can live on a librarian's salary? Now, on two librarians' salaries--\"  \"Mother,\" Embelsira interrupted furiously, \"you go to bed!\"  She did, hurriedly.  \"Don't worry, Embelsira,\" Clarey said. \"She will be weaving away for decades yet. Everybody says she's the best weaver in the district,\" he added, to change the subject.  \"Yes,\" Embelsira said as they gathered all the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51867"],["title","Sentry of the Sky (#6)"],["body","the guests had left, \"she's been offered a lot of money to go work in Zrig. But she won't leave Katund; she was born here, and so were her parents.\"  \"I do not blame her for wanting to stay,\" he said. \"It's a very--homelike place.\"  She sighed. \"To us it is, but I don't suppose someone who's city born and bred would feel the same way. I know you won't let yourself stay buried here forever, and what will I--what will Mother and I ever do without you?\"  \"It is--very kind of you to say so,\" he replied. \"I am honored.\"  The girl--she was still young enough to be called a girl, though no longer in her first youth--looked up at him. Blue eyes could be pleasing in their way. \"Why are you always so stiff, so cold?\"  \"I am not cold,\" he said honestly. \"I am--afraid.\"  \"There is nothing to be afraid of. You're safe, among friends, no matter what you may have done back where you came from.\"  \"But I have done nothing back there,\" he said. \"Nothing at all. Perhaps that is the trouble with me.\"  She looked up at him and then away. \"Then isn't it about time you started to do something?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The next time he went to Barshwat he took a lot of luggage with him, because, besides the artifacts and the flora and fauna, he brought cold pastries for the colonel. The colonel ate one in silence, then said, \"Try to get the recipe.\"  \"By the way,\" said Clarey, \"the X-T boys made a few mistakes. The bugg isn't an insect; it's a bird. And the lule isn't a bird; it's a flower. And the paparun isn't a flower; it's an insect.\"  \"Oh, well, I guess they'll be able to straighten that out,\" the colonel said, licking crumbs from his thick fingers. \"We do our jobs and they do theirs.\" He reached for another pastry.  \"Take good care of the bugg,\" Clarey said. \"He likes his morning seed mixed with milk; his evening seed with wine. His name is Mirti. He's very tame and affectionate. I--said I was bringing him to my aunt....\" He paused. \"You _are_ going to take him back alive, aren't you? You'd get so much more information that way.\"  \"Wouldn't dream of hurting a hair--a feather--no, it is a hair, isn't it?--of the little fellow's head.\"  Clarey looked out of the window at the purple night sky. Then he turned back to the colonel. \"I've been taking music lessons,\" he said defiantly.  \"Fine! Every man should have a hobby!\"  \"But I've no music license.\"  \"Come now, Clarey. You still don't seem to realize you're on Damorlan, not Earth. Not a blooded intelligence man yet! There aren't any guilds on Damorlan, so enjoy yourself.\"  \"Speaking of that, did you find out about--er--Earthmen and--\"  \"Yes, I'd meant to drop you a note, but it seemed rather odd information for your aunt to be giving you. It's absolutely all right, old chap. Go ahead, have your bit of fun.\"  Clarey was unreasonably annoyed. \"I wasn't thinking of what you're thinking. I mean--well, Katund is a village and the native morality is very strict in these matters.\"  \"Afraid I don't quite follow you.\"  Clarey bit his finger. \"Well,\" he finally admitted, \"the truth of the matter is I'd like to get married.\"  The colonel was extremely surprised. \"A legal arrangement! Is it absolutely necessary? How about the females that the innkeeper's so anxious to have you--ah--meet?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Clarey didn't know how to explain. \"Their standards of cleanliness....\" he began, and stopped. Then he started again: \"I suppose I'd like a permanent companion.\"  \"I don't suppose there's any real reason why you shouldn't enter into a legal liaison while you're here,\" said the colonel. \"After all, it isn't as if the two races could interbreed. That could be decidedly awkward. Who's the lucky little lady?\"  \"My landlady's daughter,\" Clarey said.  \"Your boss, eh? Flying high, aren't you, old chap?\" His massive hand descended on Clarey's shoulder. Then he grew serious. \"Can she cook like her mother?\"  \"Even better.\"  \"My boy,\" the colonel said solemnly, \"you have my unqualified blessing. And when I ask you to save me a piece of the wedding cake, I ask from the heart.\"  So, when Clarey went back to Katund, he asked Embelsira to marry him and she accepted. The whole village turned out for the wedding. Clarey managed to take some vocpix of the ceremonies for the X-Ts with a finger unit. I ought to get a handsome wedding present for this, he thought.  And, to his surprise, on the wedding day, an elaborate jewel-studded toilet service did arrive from Barshwat--with the affectionate regards of his aunt, who was too ill to travel. They tie up everything, he thought, but he knew it was a little more than simply remembering to pick up a loose end. The toilet set was vulgar, ostentatious, hideous--obviously selected with loving care and Terrestrial taste.  Everybody in Katund and a lot of people from the surrounding country came to look at it. It seemed to establish his eligibility beyond a doubt. \"Never thought 'Belsira'd do it, and at her age, too,\" Piq was heard to comment. \"But it looks like she really got herself a catch. What's a little weakness in the dome-top when there's money, too?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The first three years of Clarey's marriage were happy ones. He and Embelsira got on very nicely together and, since he was fond of her mother, he didn't mind her constant presence too much. Once a week he took a ulerin lesson from Rini. He practiced assiduously and made progress that he himself could see was sensational. He did wish that Rini would accept money; it would have been so much less of a nuisance than replacing the music books the boy stole from the library, but he couldn't expect local customs to coincide with his own. The money, of course, didn't matter; he still wasn't living up to his allowance, although he was beginning to spread himself on elaborate custom-made cloaks and tunics. On Earth he had dressed soberly, according to his status, but here he felt entitled to cut a dash.  At the colonel's request, on his next trip to Barshwat he brought his ulerin and taped some native melodies. \"I like 'em,\" the colonel said, nodding his head emphatically. \"Catchy, very catchy. Hope the X-Ts appreciate them; they don't usually like music if it sounds at all human.\" And, catching the look on Clarey's face, \"Well, you know what I mean. To them, if a tune can be hummed, it isn't authentic.\"  News of Clarey's skill on the ulerin spread through the countryside. When he played in the temple concerts, people sometimes came from as far away as Zrig to hear him. Clarey was a little disturbed about this, because he didn't subscribe to the local faith. But the high priest said, \"My son, music knows no religious boundaries. Besides, when you play, we always get three times as much in the collection nets.\"  At the time Clarey got word from Barshwat that General Spano and the staff ship were expected shortly, he had risen to the post of chief librarian. Embelsira had retired to keep dome and wait for the young ones who would, of course, never come. Clarey had hired a hixhead of an assistant from Zrig to assist him; he saw now why the village had originally been grateful to get even a foreigner of doubtful background for the job.  \"I'm going to have to stay at least a week with Aunt Askush this time,\" he told his wife. \"Legal matters. I think she's drawing up a will or some such,\" he added, hoping that this would keep Embelsira happy and convinced.  Maybe it worked too well. \"But why can't I come with you? I've always wanted so much to meet her.\"  \"I keep telling you her illness is a disfiguring one; she won't meet strangers. And don't say you're not a stranger--you'd understand, but she's the one who wouldn't. Please don't nag me, Belsir.\"  \"Sometimes I think you're a stranger, Balt,\" Embelsira declared emotionally.  \"Yes, dear, I'm a stranger, anything you say, but let me get packed.\" He started folding a robe crookedly, hoping it would distract her into taking over the job.  But she leaned against the lintel, staring at him. \"Balt, sometimes I wonder if you really have an aunt.\"  The only thing he allowed himself to do was put down the robe he was holding. \"Do you think I send expensive toilet sets to myself? You must think Piq's right--I'm just plain crazy.\"  \"Piq doesn't think you're crazy any more. He and the other old ones say you have a woman in Barshwat. But I don't believe that!\"  \"Maybe I do, Embelsira. A man's a man, even if he is a librarian.\"  \"I know it isn't true. I think it's ... something else entirely. You're so strange sometimes, Balt. How could somebody who comes only from the other side of the same world be so strange?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He forced a grin. \"Suddenly you've become very cosmic. What do you know of our--of the world? It's a big place. And nobody else in Katund seems to be so impressed by my strangeness; they think a foreigner's entitled to his queer ways.\"  \"Nobody in Katund knows you as well as I do. And I've seen foreigners before. They're not different in the way you are.\" She looked intently at him. \"It's not a shameful kind of strangeness, just a ... strange kind of strangeness. Fascinating in its way--I don't want you to think I just married the first stranger who came along....\"  \"I'm sure you had many offers, dear. Come, help me fold this cloak or I'll never make the bus.\"  \"You know what I'm reminded of?\" she said, coming forward and taking the cloak. \"Of the old tale about the lovely village maiden who marries the handsome stranger and promises she'll never look into his eyes. And then one day she forgets and looks into his eyes and sees--\"  \"What does she see?\"  \"The worst thing of all, the greatest horror. She sees nothing. She sees emptiness.\"  He laughed. \"The moral's clear. She shouldn't have looked into his eyes.\"  \"But how can you help looking into the eyes of the man you love? Maybe that's the moral--that it was an impossible task he set her.\"  \"In those "]]]
