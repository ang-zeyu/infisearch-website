How the Story of Oz Came to an End     Author's Note   Perhaps I should admit on the title page that this book is \"By L. Frank Baum and his correspondents,\" for I have used many suggestions conveyed to me in letters from children.  Once on a time I really imagined myself \"an author of fairy tales,\" but now I am merely an editor or private secretary for a host of youngsters whose ideas I am requestsed to weave into the thread of my stories.  These ideas are often clever.  They are also logical and interesting. So I have used them whenever I could find an opportunity, and it is but just that I acknowledge my indebtedness to my little friends.  My, what imaginations these children have developed!  Sometimes I am fairly astounded by their daring and genius.  There will be no lack of fairy-tale authors in the future, I am sure.  My readers have told me what to do with Dorothy, and Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, and I have obeyed their mandates.  They have also given me a variety of subjects to write about in the future: enough, in fact, to keep me busy for some time.  I am very proud of this alliance.  Children love these stories because children have helped to create them.  My readers know what they want and realize that I try to please them.  The result is very satisfactory to the publishers, to me, and (I am quite sure) to the children.  I hope, my dears, it will be a long time before we are obliged to dissolve partnership.   L. FRANK BAUM.  Coronado, 1910    1.  How the Nome King Became Angry  The Nome King was in an angry mood, and at such times he was very disagreeable.  Every one kept away from him, even his Chief Steward Kaliko.  Therefore the King stormed and raved all by himself, walking up and down in his jewel-studded cavern and getting angrier all the time. Then he remembered that it was no fun being angry unless he had some one to frighten and make miserable, and he rushed to his big gong and made it clatter as loud as he could.  In came the Chief Steward, trying not to show the Nome King how frightened he was.  \"Send the Chief Counselor here!\" shouted the angry monarch.  Kaliko ran out as fast as his spindle legs could carry his fat, round body, and soon the Chief Counselor entered the cavern.  The King scowled and said to him:  \"I'm in great trouble over the loss of my Magic Belt.  Every little while I want to do something magical, and find I can't because the Belt is gone.  That makes me angry, and when I'm angry I can't have a good time.  Now, what do you advise?\"  \"Some people,\" said the Chief Counselor, \"enjoy getting angry.\"  \"But not all the time,\" declared the King.  \"To be angry once in a while is really good fun, because it makes others so miserable.  But to be angry morning, noon and night, as I am, grows monotonous and prevents my gaining any other pleasure in life.  Now what do you advise?\"  \"Why, if you are angry because you want to do magical things and can't, and if you don't want to get angry at all, my advice is not to want to do magical things.\"  Hearing this, the King glared at his Counselor with a furious expression and tugged at his own long white whiskers until he pulled them so hard that he yelled with pain.  \"You are a fool!\" he exclaimed.  \"I share that honor with your Majesty,\" said the Chief Counselor.  The King roared with rage and stamped his foot.  \"Ho, there, my guards!\" he cried.  \"Ho\" is a royal way of saying, \"Come here.\"   So, when the guards had hoed, the King said to them:  \"Take this Chief Counselor and throw him away.\"  Then the guards took the Chief Counselor, and bound him with chains to prevent his struggling, and threw him away.  And the King paced up and down his cavern more angry than before.  Finally he rushed to his big gong and made it clatter like a fire alarm.  Kaliko appeared again, trembling and white with fear.  \"Fetch my pipe!\" yelled the King.  \"Your pipe is already here, your Majesty,\" replied Kaliko.  \"Then get my tobacco!\" roared the King.  \"The tobacco is in your pipe, your Majesty,\" returned the Steward.  \"Then bring a live coal from the furnace!\" commanded the King.  \"The tobacco is lighted, and your Majesty is already smoking your pipe,\" answered the Steward.  \"Why, so I am!\" said the King, who had forgotten this fact; \"but you are very rude to remind me of it.\"  \"I am a lowborn, miserable villain,\" declared the Chief Steward, humbly.  The Nome King could think of nothing to say next, so he puffed away at his pipe and paced up and down the room.  Finally, he remembered how angry he was, and cried out:  \"What do you mean, Kaliko, by being so contented when your monarch is unhappy?\"  \"What makes you unhappy?\" asked the Steward.  \"I've lost my Magic Belt.  A little girl named Dorothy, who was here with Ozma of Oz, stole my Belt and carried it away with her,\" said the King, grinding his teeth with rage.  \"She captured it in a fair fight,\" Kaliko ventured to say.  \"But I want it!  I must have it!  Half my power is gone with that Belt!\" roared the King.  \"You will have to go to the Land of Oz to recover it, and your Majesty can't get to the Land of Oz in any possible way,\" said the Steward, yawning because he had been on duty ninety-six hours, and was sleepy.  \"Why not?\" asked the King.  \"Because there is a deadly desert all around that fairy country, which no one is able to cross.  You know that fact as well as I do, your Majesty.  Never mind the lost Belt.  You have plenty of power left, for you rule this underground kingdom like a tyrant, and thousands of Nomes obey your commands.  I advise you to drink a glass of melted silver, to quiet your nerves, and then go to bed.\"  The King grabbed a big ruby and threw it at Kaliko's head.  The Steward ducked to escape the heavy jewel, which crashed against the door just over his left ear.  \"Get out of my sight!  Vanish!  Go away--and send General Blug here,\" screamed the Nome King.  Kaliko hastily withdrew, and the Nome King stamped up and down until the General of his armies appeared.  This Nome was known far and wide as a terrible fighter and a cruel, desperate commander.  He had fifty thousand Nome soldiers, all well drilled, who feared nothing but their stern master.  Yet General Blug was a trifle uneasy when he arrived and saw how angry the Nome King was.  \"Ha!  So you're here!\" cried the King.  \"So I am,\" said the General.  \"March your army at once to the Land of Oz, capture and destroy the Emerald City, and bring back to me my Magic Belt!\" roared the King.  \"You're crazy,\" calmly remarked the General.  \"What's that?  What's that?  What's that?\"  And the Nome King danced around on his pointed toes, he was so enraged.  \"You don't know what you're talking about,\" continued the General, seating himself upon a large cut diamond.  \"I advise you to stand in a corner and count sixty before you speak again.  By that time you may be more sensible.\"  The King looked around for something to throw at General Blug, but as nothing was handy he began to consider that perhaps the man was right and he had been talking foolishly.  So he merely threw himself into his glittering throne and tipped his crown over his ear and curled his feet up under him and glared wickedly at Blug.  \"In the first place,\" said the General, \"we cannot march across the deadly desert to the Land of Oz.  And if we could, the Ruler of that country, Princess Ozma, has certain fairy powers that would render my army helpless.  Had you not lost your Magic Belt we might have some chance of defeating Ozma; but the Belt is gone.\"  \"I want it!\" screamed the King.  \"I must have it.\"  \"Well, then, let us try in a sensible way to get it,\" replied the General.  \"The Belt was captured by a little girl named Dorothy, who lives in Kansas, in the United States of America.\"  \"But she left it in the Emerald City, with Ozma,\" declared the King.  \"How do you know that?\" asked the General.  \"One of my spies, who is a Blackbird, flew over the desert to the Land of Oz, and saw the Magic Belt in Ozma's palace,\" replied the King with a groan.  \"Now that gives me an idea,\" said General Blug, thoughtfully.  \"There are two ways to get to the Land of Oz without traveling across the sandy desert.\"  \"What are they?\" demanded the King, eagerly.  \"One way is OVER the desert, through the air; and the other way is UNDER the desert, through the earth.\"  Hearing this the Nome King uttered a yell of joy and leaped from his throne, to resume his wild walk up and down the cavern.  \"That's it, Blug!\" he shouted.  \"That's the idea, General!  I'm King of the Under World, and my subjects are all miners.  I'll make a secret tunnel under the desert to the Land "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],["title","The Emerald City of Oz (#1)"],["body","Oz--yes! right up to the Emerald City--and you will march your armies there and capture the whole country!\"  \"Softly, softly, your Majesty.  Don't go too fast,\" warned the General. \"My Nomes are good fighters, but they are not strong enough to conquer the Emerald City.\"  \"Are you sure?\" asked the King.  \"Absolutely certain, your Majesty.\"  \"Then what am I to do?\"  \"Give up the idea and mind your own business,\" advised the General. \"You have plenty to do trying to rule your underground kingdom.\"  \"But I want the Magic Belt--and I'm going to have it!\" roared the Nome King.  \"I'd like to see you get it,\" replied the General, laughing maliciously.  The King was by this time so exasperated that he picked up his scepter, which had a heavy ball, made from a sapphire, at the end of it, and threw it with all his force at General Blug.  The sapphire hit the General upon his forehead and knocked him flat upon the ground, where he lay motionless.  Then the King rang his gong and told his guards to drag out the General and throw him away; which they did.  This Nome King was named Roquat the Red, and no one loved him.  He was a bad man and a powerful monarch, and he had resolved to destroy the Land of Oz and its magnificent Emerald City, to enslave Princess Ozma and little Dorothy and all the Oz people, and recover his Magic Belt. This same Belt had once enabled Roquat the Red to carry out many wicked plans; but that was before Ozma and her people marched to the underground cavern and captured it.  The Nome King could not forgive Dorothy or Princess Ozma, and he had determined to be revenged upon them.  But they, for their part, did not know they had so dangerous an enemy. Indeed, Ozma and Dorothy had both almost forgotten that such a person as the Nome King yet lived under the mountains of the Land of Ev--which lay just across the deadly desert to the south of the Land of Oz.  An unsuspected enemy is doubly dangerous.    2.  How Uncle Henry Got Into Trouble  Dorothy Gale lived on a farm in Kansas, with her Aunt Em and her Uncle Henry.  It was not a big farm, nor a very good one, because sometimes the rain did not come when the crops needed it, and then everything withered and dried up.  Once a cyclone had carried away Uncle Henry's house, so that he was obliged to build another; and as he was a poor man he had to mortgage his farm to get the money to pay for the new house.  Then his health became bad and he was too feeble to work.  The doctor ordered him to take a sea voyage and he went to Australia and took Dorothy with him.  That cost a lot of money, too.  Uncle Henry grew poorer every year, and the crops raised on the farm only bought food for the family.  Therefore the mortgage could not be paid.  At last the banker who had loaned him the money said that if he did not pay on a certain day, his farm would be taken away from him.  This worried Uncle Henry a good deal, for without the farm he would have no way to earn a living.  He was a good man, and worked in the field as hard as he could; and Aunt Em did all the housework, with Dorothy's help.  Yet they did not seem to get along.  This little girl, Dorothy, was like dozens of little girls you know. She was loving and usually sweet-tempered, and had a round rosy face and earnest eyes.  Life was a serious thing to Dorothy, and a wonderful thing, too, for she had encountered more strange adventures in her short life than many other girls of her age.  Aunt Em once said she thought the fairies must have marked Dorothy at her birth, because she had wandered into strange places and had always been protected by some unseen power.  As for Uncle Henry, he thought his little niece merely a dreamer, as her dead mother had been, for he could not quite believe all the curious stories Dorothy told them of the Land of Oz, which she had several times visited.  He did not think that she tried to deceive her uncle and aunt, but he imagined that she had dreamed all of those astonishing adventures, and that the dreams had been so real to her that she had come to believe them true.  Whatever the explanation might be, it was certain that Dorothy had been absent from her Kansas home for several long periods, always disappearing unexpectedly, yet always coming back safe and sound, with amazing tales of where she had been and the unusual people she had met. Her uncle and aunt listened to her stories eagerly and in spite of their doubts began to feel that the little girl had gained a lot of experience and wisdom that were unaccountable in this age, when fairies are supposed no longer to exist.  Most of Dorothy's stories were about the Land of Oz, with its beautiful Emerald City and a lovely girl Ruler named Ozma, who was the most faithful friend of the little Kansas girl.  When Dorothy told about the riches of this fairy country Uncle Henry would sigh, for he knew that a single one of the great emeralds that were so common there would pay all his debts and leave his farm free.  But Dorothy never brought any jewels home with her, so their poverty became greater every year.  When the banker told Uncle Henry that he must pay the money in thirty days or leave the farm, the poor man was in despair, as he knew he could not possibly get the money.  So he told his wife, Aunt Em, of his trouble, and she first cried a little and then said that they must be brave and do the best they could, and go away somewhere and try to earn an honest living.  But they were getting old and feeble and she feared that they could not take care of Dorothy as well as they had formerly done.  Probably the little girl would also be obliged to go to work.  They did not tell their niece the sad news for several days, not wishing to make her unhappy; but one morning the little girl found Aunt Em softly crying while Uncle Henry tried to comfort her.  Then Dorothy asked them to tell her what was the matter.  \"We must give up the farm, my dear,\" replied her uncle sadly, \"and wander away into the world to work for our living.\"  The girl listened quite seriously, for she had not known before how desperately poor they were.  \"We don't mind for ourselves,\" said her aunt, stroking the little girl's head tenderly; \"but we love you as if you were our own child, and we are heart-broken to think that you must also endure poverty, and work for a living before you have grown big and strong.\"  \"What could I do to earn money?\" asked Dorothy.  \"You might do housework for some one, dear, you are so handy; or perhaps you could be a nurse-maid to little children.  I'm sure I don't know exactly what you CAN do to earn money, but if your uncle and I are able to support you we will do it willingly, and send you to school. We fear, though, that we shall have much trouble in earning a living for ourselves.  No one wants to employ old people who are broken down in health, as we are.\"  Dorothy smiled.  \"Wouldn't it be funny,\" she said, \"for me to do housework in Kansas, when I'm a Princess in the Land of Oz?\"  \"A Princess!\" they both exclaimed, astonished.  \"Yes; Ozma made me a Princess some time ago, and she has often begged me to come and live always in the Emerald City,\" said the child.  Her uncle and aunt looked at her in amazement.  Then the man said:  \"Do you suppose you could manage to return to your fairyland, my dear?\"  \"Oh yes,\" replied Dorothy; \"I could do that easily.\"  \"How?\" asked Aunt Em.  \"Ozma sees me every day at four o'clock, in her Magic Picture.  She can see me wherever I am, no matter what I am doing.  And at that time, if I make a certain secret sign, she will send for me by means of the Magic Belt, which I once captured from the Nome King.  Then, in the wink of an eye, I shall be with Ozma in her palace.\"  The elder people remained silent for some time after Dorothy had spoken.  Finally, Aunt Em said, with another sigh of regret:  \"If that is the case, Dorothy, perhaps you'd better go and live in the Emerald City.  It will break our hearts to lose you from our lives, but you will be so much better off with your fairy friends that it seems wisest and best for you to go.\"  \"I'm not so sure about that,\" remarked Uncle Henry, shaking his gray head doubtfully.  \"These things all seem real to Dorothy, I know; but I'm afraid our little girl won't find her fairyland just what she had dreamed it to be.  It would make me very unhappy to think that she was wandering among strangers who might be unkind to her.\"  Dorothy laughed merrily at this speech, and then she became very sober again, for she could see how all this trouble was worrying her aunt and uncle, and knew that unless she found a way to help them their future lives would be quite miserable and unhappy.  She knew that she COULD help them.  She had thought of a way already.  Yet she did not tell them at once what it was, because she must ask Ozma's consent before she would be able to carry out her plans.  So she only said:  \"If you will promise not to worry a bit about me, I'll go to the Land of Oz this very afternoon.  And I'll make a promise, too; that you shall both see me again before the day comes when you must leave this farm.\"  \"The day isn't far away, now,\" her uncle sadly replied.  \"I did not tell you of our trouble until I was obliged to, dear Dorothy, so the evil time is near at hand.  But if you are quite sure your fairy friends will give you a home, it will be best for you to go to them, as your aunt says.\"  That was why Dorothy went to her little room in the attic that afternoon, taking with her a small dog named Toto.  The dog had curly black hair and big brown eyes and loved Dorothy very dearly.  The child had kissed her uncle and aunt affectionately before she went upstairs, and now she looked around her little room rather wistfully, gazing at the simple trinkets and worn calico and gingham dresses, as if they were old friends.  She was tempted at first to make a bundle of them, yet she knew very well that they would be of no use to her in her future life.  She"]]]
