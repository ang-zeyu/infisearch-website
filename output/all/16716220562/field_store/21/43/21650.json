What he saw now was so new that he couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his eyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them. But the new view persisted.  Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone, too, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge that it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and round, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud had no name.  A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section of it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the viewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the middle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green, and on the other, blue.  Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world had ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular intervals by a sharp booming.  Change--  \"Won't you eat, Rikud?\" Chuls called from somewhere down below.  \"Damn the man,\" Rikud thought. Then aloud: \"Yes, I'll eat. Later.\"  \"It's time....\" Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently.  But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him, and for a while he struggled with it. What he saw--what he had always seen, except that now there was the added factor of change--perhaps did not exist _in_ the viewport.  Maybe it existed _through_ the viewport.  That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see nothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more confusing than ever.  \"Chuls,\" he called, remembering, \"come here.\"  \"I am here,\" said a voice at his elbow.  Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of vapor. \"What do you see?\"  Chuls looked. \"The viewport, of course.\"  \"What else?\"  \"Else? Nothing.\"  Anger welled up inside Rikud. \"All right,\" he said, \"listen. What do you hear?\"  \"Broom, brroom, brrroom!\" Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of the engines. \"I'm hungry, Rikud.\"  The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining room, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more.         *       *       *       *       *  Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a moment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world. But that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And besides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far vaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport which was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover, did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens did. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.  Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.  The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.         *       *       *       *       *  For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept it as fact. There--through the viewport and in it--was a garden. A garden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had never seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the world's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless, it was a garden.  He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"  Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\" he admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"  Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could not tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the viewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking--the word seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless it were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere was the garden and the world had arrived.  \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants are different.\"  \"Then they've changed?\"  \"No, merely different.\"  \"Well, what about the viewport? _It_ changed. Where are the stars? Where are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\"  \"The stars come out at night.\"  \"So there is a change from day to night!\"  \"I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they shine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\"  \"Once they shone all the time.\"  \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on astronomy. He hadn't been reading too much lately. The voice of the reading machine had begun to bore him. He said, \"Well, variable or not, our whole perspective has changed.\"  And when Chuls looked away in disinterest, Rikud became angry. If only the man would realize! If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so obvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another, it was with a purpose--to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the health-rays. Now if the world had walked from--somewhere, through the vast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also was purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But if everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could they find the nature of that purpose?  \"I will eat,\" Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery.  Damn the man, all he did was eat!  Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because he was hungry.  And Rikud, too, was hungry.  Differently.         *       *       *       *       *  He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and now, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading machine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the door.  \"What's in here?\" he demanded.  \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.  \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"  \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean _through_ the door.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened it. It's only a door.\"  \"I will,\" said Rikud.  \"You will what?\"  \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"  A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before? There's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"  \"No--\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of breath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently, and Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"  Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other end of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across, Rikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.  He missed the beginning, but then:      --therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this     door. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the     rigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may     have discarded it for something better--who knows? But if you have     not, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship     is a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is     human-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will     not permit it--within limits, of course. But you can damage the     ship, and to avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons     are to be permitted through this door--  Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing words. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting than that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another voice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.  When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle humming, punctuated by a _throb-throb-throb_ which sounded not unlike the booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't blast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's eyes--he blinked and looked again, but it was still there--cogs and gears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.  \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but no one quite seems to know its meaning.\"  Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might exist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one opened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.  Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The viewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and, although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography was different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way off in the distance.  And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his hand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new viewport. He began to turn the handle.  Then he trembled.  What would he do out in the garden?  He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly thought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud couldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt dry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.  Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back through the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally through the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.  By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did not dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and sweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the garden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could walk and then might find himself in the garden.  It was so big.         *       *       *       *       *  Three or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to talk about his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51296"],["title","The Sense of Wonder (#2)"],["body","rience. When he did, only Crifer seemed at all interested, yet the lame-footed man's mind was inadequate to cope with the situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable and Rikud found himself wishing that his friend had never read that book on astronomy.  Chuls did not believe Rikud at all. \"There are not that many doors in the world,\" he said. \"The library has a door and there is a door to the women's quarters; in five years, the Calculator will send you through that. But there are no others.\"  Chuls smiled an indulgent smile and Rikud came nearer to him. \"Now, by the world, there are two other doors!\"  Rikud began to shout, and everyone looked at him queerly.  \"What are you doing that for?\" demanded Wilm, who was shorter even than Crifer, but had no lame foot.  \"Doing what?\"  \"Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble hearing you.\"  \"Maybe yelling will make him understand.\"  Crifer hobbled about on his good foot, doing a meaningless little jig. \"Why don't we go see?\" he suggested. Then, confused, he frowned.  \"Well, I won't go,\" Chuls replied. \"There's no reason to go. If Rikud has been imagining things, why should I?\"  \"I imagined nothing. I'll show you--\"  \"You'll show me nothing because I won't go.\"  Rikud grabbed Chuls' blouse with his big fist. Then, startled by what he did, his hands began to tremble. But he held on, and he tugged at the blouse.  \"Stop that,\" said the older man, mildly.         *       *       *       *       *  Crifer hopped up and down. \"Look what Rikud's doing! I don't know what he's doing, but look. He's holding Chuls' blouse.\"  \"Stop that,\" repeated Chuls, his face reddening.  \"Only if you'll go with me.\" Rikud was panting.  Chuls tugged at his wrist. By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of them watched Crifer jump up and down, but most of them watched Rikud holding Chuls' blouse.  \"I think I can do that,\" declared Wilm, clutching a fistful of Crifer's shirt.  Presently, the members of the crowd had pretty well paired off, each partner grabbing for his companion's blouse. They giggled and laughed and some began to hop up and down as Crifer had done.  A buzzer sounded and automatically Rikud found himself releasing Chuls.  Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, \"Time to retire.\"  In a moment, the room was cleared. Rikud stood alone. He cleared his throat and listened to the sound, all by itself in the stillness. What would have happened if they hadn't retired? But they always did things punctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with the buzzer, bathed in the health-rays with it, slept with it.  What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing?  This frightened Rikud, although he didn't know why. He'd like it, though. Maybe then he could take them outside with him to the big garden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn't be afraid because he could huddle close to them and he wouldn't be alone.         *       *       *       *       *  Rikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of the machinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gears spinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then he began to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears, would the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, he was clearly an \"unauthorized person.\" He had heard the voice again upon entering the room.  He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half as wide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires that held it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he swung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding, crashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbled under his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm.  Almost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were not casual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikud smashed everything in sight.  When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the room was a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first, but presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled in his ears because now the throbbing had stopped.  He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smaller viewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain beneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone clearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.  Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that door. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once, when he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the darkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.  Whimpering, he fled.         *       *       *       *       *  All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did not sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to eat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the whimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the smooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run any more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.  Chuls said, over and over, \"I'm hungry.\"  \"We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,\" Wilm replied confidently.  \"It won't any more,\" Rikud said.  \"What won't?\"  \"The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.\"  Crifer growled. \"I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a bad thing you did, Rikud.\"  \"It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the stars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there beyond the viewport.\"  \"That's ridiculous,\" Chuls said.  Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. \"He broke the buzzer and no one can eat. I hate Rikud, I think.\"  There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, \"I hate Rikud.\" Then everyone was saying it.  Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have had a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's quarters. Did women eat?  Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a frond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the plants in the viewport would even be better.  \"We will not be hungry if we go outside,\" he said. \"We can eat there.\"  \"We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,\" Chuls said dully.  Crifer shrilled, \"Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.\"  \"No,\" Rikud assured him. \"It won't.\"  \"Then you broke it and I hate you,\" said Crifer. \"We should break you, too, to show you how it is to be broken.\"  \"We must go outside--through the viewport.\" Rikud listened to the odd gurgling sound his stomach made.  A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard Crifer's voice. \"I have Rikud's head.\" The voice was nasty, hostile.  Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had broken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer to understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.  The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face. \"I hit him! I hit him!\"  Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone was on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and he did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, \"Let us do to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the darkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too weak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing hurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the angry voices and the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.  It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run was chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and how big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him were unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely and positively.  He became sickly giddy thinking about it.  But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he would die because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and grumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.  He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library, through the inner door and into the room with the voice--but the voice didn't speak this time--through its door and into the place of machinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and he thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard Crifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.  Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor. He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it with his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.  He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were closer now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness, it frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those behind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not far away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to break him.  Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life. The garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of low mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If plants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could people. Rikud and his people _should_. This was why the world had moved across the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more. But he was afraid.  He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his fingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head. Slowly he slipped to the cool floor--"]]]
