The child sat on the floor in the corner with her knees drawn up against her chest. Between the knees and the chest, the frail wrists were crossed, the hands closed limply like--like those of a fetus. The forehead rested on the knees so that, should the closed eyes stray open, they would be looking at the placid hands.  The sickening sight of the child squeezed down on his heart till the color drained from his face. He went forward and knelt before her. His dry throat hammered with the words, _what have I done to you_, but he could not speak. The question of how long she might have been here, he could not bear to think.  He put out his hand, but he did not touch her. A shudder of revulsion shook him and he scrambled to his feet. He hurried back into the apartment with only one thought. He must get someone to help her. Only the Medicorps could take care of a situation like this.  As he stood at the visiophone, he knew that this involuntary act of panic had betrayed all that he had ever thought and done. He had to call the Medicorps. He could not face the result of his own behavior without them. Like a ghostly after-image, he saw Clara's face on the screen. She was lost, cut off, with only himself to depend on.  A part of him, a place where there were no voices and a great tragedy, had been abruptly shut off. He stood stupidly confused and disturbed about something he couldn't recall. The emotion in his body suddenly had no referent. He stood like a badly frightened animal while his heart slowed and blood seeped again into whitened parenchymas, while tides of epinephrine burned lower.  Remembering he must hurry, Bill left the apartment. It was an apartment with its storage room door closed, an apartment without a storage room.  From the moment that he walked in and took Clara in his arms, he was not worried about being caught. He felt only the great need for her. There seemed only one difference from the first time and it was a good difference, because now Clara was so tense and apprehensive. He felt a new tenderness for her, as one might feel for a child. It seemed to him that there was no end to the well of gentleness and compassion that was suddenly in him. He was mystified by the depth of this feeling. He kissed her again and again and petted her as one might a disturbed child.  Clara said, \"Oh, Bill, we're doing wrong! Mary was here yesterday!\"  Whoever she meant, it had no meaning for him. He said, \"It's all right. You mustn't worry.\"  \"She needs you, Bill, and I take you away from her.\"  Whatever it was she was talking about was utterly unimportant beside the fact that she was not happy herself. He soothed her. \"Darling, you mustn't worry about it. Let's be happy the way we used to be.\"  He led her to a couch and they sat together, her head resting on his shoulder.  \"Conrad is worried about me. He knows something is wrong. Oh, Bill, if he knew, he'd demand the worst penalty for you.\"  Bill felt the stone of fear come back in his chest. He thought, too, of Helen, of how intense her shame would be. Medicorps action would be machinelike, logical as a set of equation; they were very likely to take more drastic steps where the complaints would be so strong and no request for leniency forthcoming. Conrad knew now, of course. Bill had felt his hate.  It was nearing the end. Death would come to Bill with electronic fingers. A ghostly probing in his mind and suddenly....  Clara's great unhappiness and the way she turned her head into his shoulder to cry forced him to calm the rising panic in himself, and again to caress the fear from her.  Even later, when they lay where the moonlight thrust into the room an impalpable shaft of alabaster, he loved her only as a succor. Carefully, slowly, smoothing out her mind, drawing it away from all the other things, drawing it down into this one thing. Gathering all her mind into her senses and holding it there. Then quickly taking it away from her in a moaning spasm so that now she was murmuring, murmuring, palely drifting. Sleeping like a loved child.  For a long, long time he watched the white moon cut its arc across their window. He listened with a deep pleasure to her evenly breathing sleep. But slowly he realized that her breath had changed, that the body so close to his was tensing. His heart gave a great bound and tiny moths of horror fluttered along his back. He raised himself and saw that the eyes were open in the silver light. Even through the makeup he saw that they were Helen's eyes.  He did the only thing left for him. He shifted. But in that terrible instant he understood something he had not anticipated. In Helen's eyes there was not only intense shame over shifting into her hypoalter's home; there was not only the disgust with himself for breaking communication codes. He saw that, as a woman of the 20th Century might have felt, Helen hated Clara as a sexual rival. She hated Clara doubly because he had turned not to some other woman, but to the other part of herself whom she could never know.  As he shifted, Bill knew that the next light he saw would be on the adamant face of the Medicorps.         *       *       *       *       *  Major Paul Grey, with two other Medicorps officers, entered the Walden apartment about two hours after Bill left it to meet Clara. Major Grey was angry with himself. Important information on a case of communication-breaks and drug-refusal could be learned by letting it run its course under observation. But he had not intended Conrad Manz's life to be endangered, and certainly he would not have taken the slightest chance on what they found in the Walden apartment if he had expected it this early.  Major Grey blamed himself for what had happened to Mary Walden. He should have had the machines watching Susan and Mary at the same time that they were relaying all wristband data for Bill and Conrad and for Helen and Clara to his office.  He had not done this because it was Susan's shift and he had not expected Mary to break it. Now he knew that Helen and Bill Walden had been quarreling over the fact that Clara was cheating on Helen's shifts, and their conversations had directed the unhappy child's attention to the Manz couple. She had broken shift to meet them ... looking for a loving father, of course.  Still--things would not have turned out so badly if Captain Thiel, Mary's school officer, had not attributed Susan Shorrs' disappearance only to poor drug acclimatization. Captain Thiel had naturally known that Major Grey was in town to prosecute Bill Walden, because the major had called on him to discuss the case. Yet it had not occurred to him, until 18 hours after Susan's disappearance, that Mary might have forced the shift for some reason associated with her aberrant father.  By the time the captain advised him, Major Grey already knew that Bill had forced the shift on Conrad under desperate circumstances and he had decided to close in. He fully expected to find the father and daughter at the apartment, and now ... it sickened him to see the child's demented condition and realize that Bill had left her there.  Major Grey could see at a glance that Mary Walden would not be accessible for days even with the best treatment. He left it to the other two officers to hospitalize the child and set out for the Manz apartment.  He used his master wristband to open the door there, and found a woman standing in the middle of the room, wrapped in a sheet. He knew that this must be Helen Walden. It was odd how ill-fitting Clara Manz's softly sensual makeup seemed, even to a stranger, on the more rigidly composed face before him. He guessed that Helen would wear color higher on her cheeks and the mouth would be done in severe lines. Certainly the present haughty face struggled with its incongruous makeup as well as the indignity of her dress.  She pulled the sheet tighter about her and said icily, \"I will not wear that woman's clothes.\"  Major Grey introduced himself and asked, \"Where is Bill Walden?\"  \"He shifted! He left me with.... Oh, I'm so ashamed!\"  Major Grey shared her loathing. There was no way to escape the conditioning of childhood--sex relations between hyperalter and hypoalter were more than outlawed, they were in themselves disgusting. If they were allowed, they could destroy this civilization. Those idealists--they were almost all hypoalters, of course--who wanted the old terminology changed didn't take that into account. Next thing they'd want children to live with their actual parents!  Major Grey stepped into the bedroom. Through the bathroom door beyond, he could see Conrad Manz changing his makeup.  Conrad turned and eyed him bluntly. \"Would you mind staying out of here till I'm finished? I've had about all I can take.\"  Major Grey shut the door and returned to Helen Walden. He took a hypothalamic block from his own pharmacase and handed it to her. \"Here, you're probably on very low drug levels. You'd better take this.\" He poured her a glass of pop from a decanter and, while they waited for Conrad, he dialed the nearest shifting station on the visiophone and ordered up an emergency shifting costume for her.  When at last they were both dressed, made up to their satisfaction and drugged to his satisfaction, he had them sit on a couch together across from him. They sat at opposite ends of it, stiff with resentment at each other's presence.  Major Grey said calmly, \"You realize that this matter is coming to a Medicorps trial. It will be serious.\"  Major Grey watched their faces. On hers he saw grim determination. On Conrad's face he saw the heavy movement of alarm. The man loved his wife. That was going to help. \"It is necessary in a case such as this for the Medicorps to weigh your decisions along with the scientific evidence we will accumulate. Unfortunately, the number of laymen directly involved in this case--and not on trial--is only two, due to your peculiar marriage.

I  Len Mattern paused before the door of the Golden Apple Bar. The elation that had carried him up to this point suddenly wasn't there any more. Lyddy couldn't have changed too much, he'd kept telling himself. After all, it hadn't been so very long since he'd seen her. Now he found himself counting the years ... and they added up to a long time.  But it was too late to go back now. A familiar thought. The commitment was moral only, and to himself, no one else--the same way it had been that other time, the time that had changed the direction of his whole life, and, possibly, of all other lives in his universe as well. There was only one human being with whom he kept faith--himself. Therefore, the commitment was a binding one.  He pushed open the door and went in.  He saw Lyddy at the end of the bar, surrounded by a group of men. Lyddy had always been surrounded by a group of men, he remembered, unless she was up in her room entertaining just one. She half-turned and he saw her face. The sun-pink lips were parted, her eyes still comparable to the heavens of Earth. She stood erect and lithe and slender.  _She had not changed at all!_         *       *       *       *       *  The tension that had built up inside him snapped with the weight of sudden relief. He lurched against a small hokur-motal table. It rocked crazily. The zhapik who owned the Golden Apple came out from behind the carved screen where he'd been sitting segregated from the customers. Many of the zhapiq, who had been native to Erytheia before the Federation took over, owned businesses catering to humans. It might be degrading, but it paid well.  \"Maybe you've had enough to drink, Captain?\" he suggested. \"Maybe you'd like to come back another time?\"  \"I haven't had anything at all to drink,\" Mattern said curtly. \"What's more, I haven't come for a drink.\"  He strode across the room, firmly now, and brushed aside the men who clustered around Lyddy. \"I've come for you,\" he told her.  She didn't say anything, just looked him up and down. The beautiful blue eyes skillfully appraised his worth as a man and as a customer. Then she smiled and patted the gilded hair that streamed past her bare shoulders to her narrow waist.  \"You're not a Far Planets man,\" she said. \"How come you know about me?\"  Funny he should feel disappointed. Sure, he'd been thinking of her all those years, but he'd never expected her to have been thinking of him. Yet he found himself blurting out, \"Don't you remember me, Lyddy?\" Then he cursed himself; first because he didn't want her to remember him as he had been; second, because he knew every man who'd ever slept with her--or a woman like her--would ask the same question. And, of course, she'd have the standard answer, something like \"Why, of course I remember you, honey. I'm just not good at names.\"  But she just looked at him levelly. \"No, dear, I'm afraid I don't remember you,\" she said. Then a tiny frown gathered on her smooth forehead. \"Seems to me I would've, though. When did I meet you?\"  \"Oh, years ago! I was just a kid!\"  She flushed, and he realized he'd been a little tactless. If he was no kid any more, neither would she be. Still, she looked as young as she ever had, and he, he knew, looked younger.  He didn't want her to probe further, so he hastily made an appointment with her for an evening later that week. As he left, he could hear her saying, in a bewildered voice, \"I could've sworn there was somebody with him when he came in.\"  And he quickened his steps.         *       *       *       *       *  She had the same room--a warm luxurious chamber, high up in the Golden Apple Hotel. Lyddy herself was the same, too, just as he remembered her.  Afterward, as they lay together in the blackness, she asked, \"Can you see in the dark, Captain?\"  He was surprised, and then, thinking about it, not so surprised. \"Of course not, no more than you can! Whatever made you ask that?\"  \"I--feel like somebody's looking at me.\"  He rolled over on his side, so his body was as far away from hers as possible. He didn't want her to feel the sudden rise of tension in him. _Something's got to be done about this_, he thought. _I can't put up with it now._  \"Why don't you say anything, honey?\" her anxious voice came out of the darkness.  \"Will you marry me, Lyddy?\" he said.  He could hear the intake of her breath. \"Ask me again in the morning,\" she told him wearily. He knew what she must be thinking: Men who hadn't had a woman for a long time sometimes did strange things. In the morning, she would wake up and he would be gone.  Only, when morning came, he was still there. Two weeks later, they were married.   II  Lyddy was curious about her husband-to-be and kept trying to find out all about him. Fortunately, in the code of the Far Planets, a man's past was his own business, so he was able to be evasive without actually lying to her. Not that he had any scruples, about lying; it was simply easier to tell as few stories as possible, rather than worry about keeping them straight.  But it was all right to ask about a man's present. \"Do you have anybody, Len? Relations, anything like that?\"  He frowned a little, remembering the boy on Fairhurst. \"No,\" he said, \"I have no relatives. I have nobody.\"  Her face fell. \"It would've been kind of nice to have a ready-made family.\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" he said. \"There are times when it's better to have no family.\"  \"Yeah, I guess you're right. They might not approve of me.\"  \"We'll be everything to each other,\" he assured her.  There was a ghost of a sound then--a laugh or a sigh. He hoped she didn't hear it.  The zhapik insisted on giving Lyddy's wedding, even though he himself could, of course, be present only behind the screen. Most people said the old E-T bastard knew a good piece of publicity when he saw it, but Mattern thought it might be out of genuine sentiment. He was closer to aliens than most men in this sector, any sector. Although he had originally hailed from the Far Planets, he had traveled widely and lost his prejudices. His best friend wasn't human.  Every human in Erytheia City was invited to the wedding. Mattern's four crewmen came. Three were middle-aged and had sailed with Mattern for years, but his most recent acquisition was a young man, almost a boy. Something Raines, his name was. He kept staring at Lyddy as if he had never seen a beautiful woman before, though, coming from Earth, he must have seen many. Mattern was gratified at this tribute to his choice.  \"Only four crewmen!\" Lyddy said, looking disappointed. \"You must have a small ship.\"  Mattern smiled. \"Not too small.\" He could see she didn't believe him.  Lyddy didn't seem to be enjoying her wedding. She kept glancing over her shoulder all through the ceremony and during the reception. Finally Mattern had to ask her what was wrong, although he would rather not have known.  \"Y'know, hon,\" she whispered, \"I keep having the funniest feeling there's somebody _extra_ here, somebody who doesn't belong. I haven't quite seen him; he always seems to slip by so fast, but I don't even think he's a man.\"  \"Don't be silly, Lyddy,\" he said, almost sharply. \"You know no extraterrestrial would dare to crash a human party!\"  \"I guess not.\" But she still kept looking over her shoulder.         *       *       *       *       *  The zhapik invited them to remain at the Golden Apple Hotel as his guests for as long as they liked. They stayed two months. Then Mattern told his wife it was time they started planning their future, decided where they were going to live. \"You'll want a home of your own,\" he said. \"Otherwise you'll get bored.\"  \"I'm never bored,\" said Lyddy. \"But where will we go? I mean what system?\"  \"Well, Erytheia is a pleasure planet, so I thought we might as well stay here. There are some attractive residential neighborhoods on this continent--or, if you'd prefer, the other one.\"  Her face fell. \"You mean we're going to stay _here_?\"  He didn't know why he was so anxious to remain on Erytheia. Mainly it was because for no good reason he found himself disliking the idea of making the Jump with her. \"If you'd rather, I could build you a city of your own, Lyddy,\" he tempted her.  It was obvious that even if she had taken this seriously, it still wouldn't be what she wanted. \"I'd like to go away from here,\" she told him. \"Far away.\"  \"Just because you want a change--is that it?\"  She hesitated. \"That's partly it. But there's more. Somehow, ever since we've been married, I keep feeling all the time like--like I'm being watched.\"  His smile was strained. \"Well, naturally, in 'Rytheia City, people will tend to--watch. Let's go far away from where people are. There's an island on this planet, way off in the western seas. I'll buy you that island, Lyddy. I'll build you a villa there--a chateau, a castle, whatever you want.\"  But she shook her golden head. \"No, nothing like that. I want to go to another system. It's not that I don't want to be where people are. I like crowds. I just want to be where there are _different_ people.\"  He forced another smile. \"What's gotten into you, Lyddy? In the old days, you used to be so calm.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She wriggled her shoulders uncomfortably. \"I keep seeing things, shadows that shouldn't be there, reflections of nothing. Only, when I turn, they don't get out of the way fast enough to be nothing.\"  \"They?\" he repeated.  \"I only see one at a "]]]
