And this time he can build better, because he has the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"  And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.  \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job, and they knew it.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, I went ahead with the test anyway, and I was caught at it. For my punishment, I was banned from the Project. They kicked me out, telling me if I thought it was safe Outside I could live Outside. And if it really was safe, I could come back and tell them. Except that they also made it clear that I would be shot if I tried to get back in, because I would be carrying deadly radiation.\"  He smiled bitterly. \"They had it all their own way,\" he said. \"But it _is_ safe out there, I'm living proof of it. I lived Outside for five months. And gradually I realized I had to tell others. I had to spread the word that Man could have his world back. I didn't dare try to get back into my own Project; I would have been recognized and shot before I could say a word. So I came here.\"  He paused to finish the cup of chico that I should have had with lunch. \"I knew better,\" he continued, \"than to simply walk into the building and announce that I came from Outside. Man has an instinctive distrust for strangers anyway; the Projects only intensify it. Once again, I would have been shot. So I've been working in a more devious way. I snuck into the Project--not a difficult thing for a man with no metal on his person, no radiation shield cocooning him--and for the last two months I've been wandering around the building talking with people. I strike up a conversation. I try to plant a few seeds of doubt about the deadliness of Outside, and I hope that at least a few of the people I talk to will begin to wonder, as I once did.\"  Two months! This spy, by his own admission, had been in the Project two months before being detected. I'd never heard of such a thing, and I hoped I'd never hear of such a thing again.  \"Things worked out pretty well,\" he said, \"until today. I said something wrong--I'm still not sure what--and the man I was talking to hollered for Army, shouted I was a spy.\" He pounded the chair arm. \"But I'm not a spy! And it's the truth, Outside is safe!\" He glared suddenly at the window. \"Why've you got that drape up there?\"  \"The window broke down,\" I explained. \"It's stuck at transparent.\"  \"Transparent? Fine!\" He got up from the chair, strode across the room, and ripped the drape down from the window.  I cowered away from the sun-glare, turning my back to the window.  \"Come over here!\" he shouted. When I didn't move, he snarled, \"Get up and come over here, or I swear I'll shoot!\"  And he would have, it was plain in his voice. I got to my feet, hesitant, and walked trembling to the window, squinting against the glare.  \"Look out there,\" he ordered. \"Look!\"  I looked.   IV  Terror. Horror. Dizziness and nausea.  Far and away and far, nothing and nothing. Only the glare, and the high blue, and the far far horizon, and the broken gray slag stretching out, way down below.  \"Do you see?\" he demanded. \"Look down there! We're so high up, it's hard to see, but _look_ for it. Do you see it? Do you see the green? Do you know what that means? There are green things growing again Outside! Not much yet. It's only just started back, but it's begun. The radiation is down. Plants are growing again.\"  The power of suggestion. And, of course, the heightened sensitivity caused by the double threat of a man beside me carrying a gun that yawning aching expanse of nothing beyond the window. I nearly fancied that I did see faint specks of green.  \"Do you see it?\" he asked me.  \"Wait,\" I said. I leaned closer to the window, though every nerve in me wanted to leap the other way. \"Yes!\" I said. \"Yes, I see it! Green!\"  He sighed, a long painful sigh of thanksgiving. \"Then now you know,\" he said. \"I've been telling you the truth. It _is_ safe Outside.\"  And my lie worked. For the first time, his guard was completely down.  I moved like a whirlwind. I leaped, and twisted his arm in a hard hammerlock, which caused him to cry out and drop the gun. That was wrestling. Then I turned and twisted and dipped, causing him to fly over my head and crash to the floor. That was judo. Then I jabbed one rigid forefinger against a certain spot on the side of his neck, causing the blood in his veins to forever stop its motion. That was karati.         *       *       *       *       *  Well, by the time the Army men had finished questioning me, it was three o'clock in the afternoon, and I was five hours late. The Army men corroborated my belief that the man had been a spy, who had apparently lost his mind when cornered in the elevator. Outside was still dangerous, of course, they assured me of that. And he'd been lying about having been here two months. He'd been in the Project less than two days. Not only that, the Army men told me they'd found the radiation-proof car he'd driven, and in which he had hoped to drive back to his own Project once he'd discovered all our defenses.  Despite the fact that I had the most legitimate excuse for tardiness under the roof, Linda refused to forgive me for not making our ten o'clock meeting. When I asked her to marry me she refused, at length and descriptively.  But I was surprised and relieved to discover how rapidly I got over my heartbreak. This was aided by the fact that once the news of my exploit spread, there were any number of girls more than anxious to get to know me better, including the well-cleavaged young lady from the Transit Staff. After all, I was a hero.  They even gave me a medal."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51688"],["title","The Air of Castor Oil (#0)"],["body","AIR OF CASTOR OIL                               BY JIM HARMON                           Illustrated by WALKER             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                      Galaxy Magazine August 1961.

Not while I am alive, it won't!   It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached to do.  I turned the corner.  The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.  There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.  The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the crumbling stone.  A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat, carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.  I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.  My footsteps carried me on down the block.  A little car spurted on past me. One of those foreign jobs, I decided. Only it wasn't. I fixed the silhouette in my mind's eye and identified it. A Henry J.  Still, I wasn't worried. It was actually too early in the day. It wasn't as if it were evening or anything like that.  The little store was right where I left it, rotting quietly to itself. The Back Number Store, the faded circus poster proclaimed in red and gold, or now, pink and lemon. In the window, in cellophane envelopes, were the first issue of _Life_, a recent issue of _Modern Man_ with a modern woman fronting it, a Big Big Book of _Buck Rogers and the Silver Cities of Venus_, and a brand-new, sun-bleached copy of _Doctor Zhivago_.  There was a little car at the curb. This time I recognized that it wasn't an import, just a Crosley.  I went in, the brass handle making me conscious of the sweat on my palm.         *       *       *       *       *  The old man sat behind a fortress of magazines and books, treacherously reading the funnies in a newspaper. His bald head swiveled on the hunched shoulders of his sweater which was azuring toward white. He grinned, toothless.  \"Came back for more of the stuff, did you?\"  He laid down the newspaper. (That subheadline couldn't really be making so nasty a suggestion to a noted general, could it?)  \"Yes,\" I laughed, not very true.  \"I know what a craving can be. I shouldn't smoke, but I do. I've tried to stop but I lie there thinking about cigarettes half the night. Long ones, short ones, smoked ones, ones unlit. I feel like I could smoke one in each hand. It like that with you?\"  \"Not that bad. To me it's just--\"  \"Don't tell me reading isn't a craving with some of you fellows. I've seen guys come in here, hardly two threads stuck together on them, and grab up them horror magazines and read and read, until sweat starts rolling off the end of their nose. I've hardly got the heart to throw 'em out.\"  Horror magazines. Ones with lovely girls about to have their flesh shredded by toothy vampires. Yes, they were a part of it. Not a big part, but a part.  \"That's not what I want to see. I want--\"  The old man snickered. \"I know what you want. Indeed I do. This way.\"  I followed his spidering hand and sure enough, there they were. Stacks upon stacks of air-war pulp magazines.  \"Fifteen cents for ones in good condition,\" the old man pronounced the ritual, \"a dime for ones with incomplete covers, three for a quarter, check 'em at the desk when you go.\"  I ran my hand down a stack. _Wings_, _Daredevil Aces_, _G-8 and his Battle Aces_, _The Lone Eagle_, all of them.  The old man was watching me. He skittered back across the floor and snatched up a magazine. It was a copy of _Sky Fighters_ with a girl in a painted-on flying suit hanging from the struts of a Tiger Moth.  \"This one, this one,\" he said. \"This must be a good one. I bet she gets shoved right into that propeller there. I bet she gets chopped to pieces. Pieces.\"  \"I'll take it.\"  Reluctantly he handed over the magazine, waited a moment, then left me.  I stared at the stacks of flying story magazines and I felt the slow run of the drop of sweat down my nose.  My sickness was terrible. It is as bad to be nostalgic for things you have never known as for an orphan who has never had a home to be homesick.         *       *       *       *       *  Living in the past, that was always me. I never watched anything on TV made later than 1935. I was in love with Garbo, Ginger Rogers, Dolores del Rio. My favorite stars were Richard Dix, Chester Morris and Richard Arlen.  The music I listened to was Gershwin and Arlen and Chicago jazz.  And my reading was the pulp literature harking back to the First World War. This was the biggest part of it all, I think.  You identify with the hero of any story if it's well enough written. But the identification I felt with the pilots in air-war stories was plainly ridiculous.  I was there.  I was in the saddle of the cockpit, feeling on my face the bite of the slipstream--no, that was a later term--the prop-wash?--no, that was still later--the backlash from the screw, that was it. I was lifting to meet the Fokker triplanes in the dawn sky. Then in a moment my Vickers was chattering in answer to Spandaus, firing through the screw outfitted with iron edges to deflect bullets that did not pass to the left and right. And back through the aerial maps in the cockpit pocket at my knee.  Here he comes, the Spandaus firing right through the screw in perfect synchronization. Look at that chivalrous wave. You can almost see the dueling scar on his cheek from old Krautenberg. He can afford to be chivalrous in that Fokker. I'd like to trade this skiddoo for it. That may be just what I do too if I don't watch it.  You ain't any Boelcke, mister, but this is from the Fifth for Squadron 70.  Missed!  Hard on that rudder! God, look at the snake in that fabric. At least it was a lie about them using incendiaries.  One of your own tricks for you, Heinie. Up on the stick, up under your tail, into the blind spot. Where am I? Where am I? _Right here._  Look at that tail go. Tony can't be giving you as good stuff as he claims.  So long. I'm waving, see.  He's pulling her up. No tail and he's pulling her up. He's a good man. Come on. A little more. A little more and you can deadstick her. Come on, buddy. You're doing it. You're pulling her up--  But not enough.  God, what a mess.  I'm sick.  That damned castor oil in the carburetor. I'll be in the W. C. until oh-six-hundred....         *       *       *       *       *  No, the air wasn't one of castor oil but the pleasant smell of aged paper and printer's ink.  I'd been daydreaming again. I shouldn't forget things were getting different lately. It was becoming dangerous.  I gathered up an armload of air-war magazines at random.  Leaning across the table, I noticed the curtain in back for the first time. It was a beaded curtain of many different colors. Theda Bara might have worn it for a skirt. Behind the curtain was a television set. It was a comforting anti-anachronism here.  The six- or eight-inch picture was on a very flat tube, a more pronounced Predicta. The size and the flatness didn't seem to go together. Then I saw that the top part of the set was a mirror reflecting an image from the roof of the cabinet where the actual picture tube lay flat.  There was an old movie on the channel. An old, old movie. Lon Chaney, Sr., in a western as a badman. He was protecting a doll-faced blonde from the rest of the gang, standing them off from a grove of rocks. The flickering action caught my unblinking eyes.  Tom Santschi is sneaking across the top of the rocks, a knife in his dirty half-breed hand. Raymond Hatton makes a try for his old boss, but Chaney stops his clock for him. Now William Farnum is riding up with the posse. Tom makes a try with the knife, the girl screams, and Chaney turns the blade back on him. It goes through his neck, all the way through.  The blonde is running toward Farnum as he polishes off the rest of the gang and dismounts, her blouse shredded, revealing one breast--is that the dawn of Bessie Love? Chaney stands up in the rocks. Farnum aims his six-shooter. No, no, say the girl's lips. \"No!\" \"No!\" says the subtitle. Farnum fires. Swimming in blood, Chaney smiles sadly and falls.  I had seen movies like that before.  When I was a kid, I had seen _Flicker Flashbacks_ between chapters of Flash Gordon and Johnny Mack Brown westerns. I looked at old movies and heard the oily voice making fun of them. But hadn't I also seen these pictures with the sound of piano playing and low conversation?  I had seen these pictures before the war.  The war had made a lot of difference in my life.  Comic books were cut down to half their size, from 64 to 32 pages, and prices had gone up to where you had to pay $17 for a pair of shoes, so high that people said Wilson should do something about it.  Tom Mix had gone off the air and he and his Cowboy Commandos beat the Japs in comic books. Only, hadn't he sold Liberty Bonds with Helen Morgan?  And at school I had bought Defense--War--Savings--Security--Liberty--Freedom--I had bought stamps at school. I never did get enough to trade in for a bond, but Mama had taken my book and traded parts of it in for coffee. She could never get enough coffee....  \"Nob"]]]
