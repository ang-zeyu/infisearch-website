After all, how long would it take for you to get together a sufficient sum at that rate?\" And the kqyres indicated the gold.  \"You got a point there.\" Mattern could see that the xhind was right. It would be a lot more sensible to make a few more trips and get himself a sizable bankroll before going after Lyddy, so he'd never have to share her again. Otherwise it would be back and forth, back and forth, until it sent him off his mental course.         *       *       *       *       *  So, as soon as he disposed of the gold, he went back with another cargo, and then another. Waiting for Lyddy wasn't as bad as he thought it would be, because he could talk to the kqyres about her. He'd never had somebody he could really talk to; even Captain Schiemann hadn't really been a companion. The kqyres always seemed interested in what Mattern had to say. He never talked much about himself, but he listened patiently to Mattern's description of Lyddy's talents, and charms, including some which, as a non-human, he could understand only intellectually, if at all.  And he didn't only listen, with it going in one ear and out the other--or whatever the xhindi had instead of ears. He made helpful suggestions, such as maybe Mattern ought to fix himself up a little before going back for Lyddy.  \"I know she is to be--bought,\" he said, as if he still didn't quite understand what that meant, \"but would you not derive greater pleasure from your purchase if you knew you were a man whom a woman could like for his own self?\"  Len was silent. He knew the kqyres couldn't understand human concepts of beauty; he had taken Len's own word that the young man wasn't much of a specimen, that his body and his teeth were crooked and his skin bad, his vision defective and his hair drab. Lyddy deserved something better than that; Len knew it himself. Even if she would go with him for the sake of the money, it wasn't the same thing.  \"I could get my teeth fixed up in this sector,\" he said at last, \"but I'd need to go to the Near Planets, maybe even Earth, to have my leg fixed. It'd take a long time and passage costs a hell of a lot. People don't go that far just for a junket, you know. For most of 'em, it's a once-in-a-lifetime deal.\"  \"Of course,\" Njeri said. \"Your wealth is dearly won; you wouldn't want to squander it. However, wouldn't a considerable economy be effected if you went in your own ship?\"  \"The _Valkyrie_!\" Len was shocked into laughter. \"She'd never make it to Earth! She'd crumple up like an old paper bag!\"  \"She will not last much longer, in any case,\" said Njeri.  Len had been thinking that himself for some time--wondering how soon he would have no ship left at all, and what he would do then.  \"It would be wise,\" the kqyres suggested, \"for you first to get enough money to pay for a new ship. Only a few more trips should be necessary. Then go to whatever planet you deem most suitable for the necessary improvements, and finally return to Lyddy--a man worthy not only of her but of any woman.\"  \"It'll take so long,\" Mattern said, tempted, and yet driven wild by the idea of Lyddy, so close to attainment.  \"At your age, what are a few more trips?\"  Len gave in.         *       *       *       *       *  Actually, it took five trips into hyperspace merely to pay for the new vessel, a much larger and more elaborate model than Len had planned on buying. \"In the long run,\" his partner told him, \"the best is most economical. A sound, spaceworthy vessel such as this one will last out your lifetime. And you can call her the _Hesperian Queen_, after Lyddy.\"  \"Why?\" Len asked. \"Is that what Lyddy is short for?\"  \"It is the same as naming it after her,\" the kqyres said shortly. \"Only it's a little more subtle.\"  \"Oh.\" Somehow the kqyres made Len feel stupid, _uncouth_ almost, even though he was the human being and the other nothing but hyperextraterrestrial.  The treatments were even costlier than anticipated, and it took many more trips to pay for them. Expenses were increased by the fact that he had to commute back and forth from his sector of space to the planet where he was being treated, since he couldn't afford to neglect his business now that his costs were mounting.  He had his leg straightened on Earth. That world was as colorful, as complex, as intoxicating as it was claimed to be. One series of marvels after another presented themselves before his inexperienced eyes like scenes in a vision show--except that he was actually there, breathing, tasting, feeling a part of this vast sophistication. Earth had many beautiful women, and he enjoyed the favors of those in Lyddy's profession, but only to prove to himself that she was much more wonderful.  He decided there was no point bothering with the other planets; he might as well have his teeth and everything else taken care of on Earth, too. \"Very wise of you,\" the kqyres approved. \"The best is always the soundest, and, hence, most worth waiting for. Like Lyddy.\"  \"Yes,\" Mattern agreed, \"she is the best. And the most beautiful.\"  \"Of course,\" the kqyres said. \"Tell me more about her.\"  And Mattern talked, far into the night. What he couldn't remember of her by now, he imagined, so that the picture should be complete, not only for the xhind but for himself.  When his leg and his teeth had been fixed, \"Why stop at that?\" the kqyres asked. \"If it had not been for the way that stepfather of yours treated you as a child--\" for Len had found himself telling his companion not only about Lyddy but about everything--\"you would be a fine-looking man today. It would be no difficult task to have you restored to what you should rightfully be.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mattern would not, of course, do such a thing out of vanity. But the more presentable he made himself, the more he would be offering Lyddy. So it would be worth the extra time, especially since he could spend so much of it on Earth. Lyddy had come from Earth; it would be a bond between them later.  Doctors and cosmetologists got to work on him. Each treatment seemed to be lengthier than the preceding one, and more expensive. He could, however, easily afford it--all he had to do was make more trips. The kqyres not only told him what cargoes to take but advised him on the investments to make with his profits.  They did very well together. As far as Mattern was concerned, they did fabulously well, because he had to make enough on his side to counterbalance the entire expenses of a planet on the other. The thought impressed him. _I am, in a sense, equal to the mbretersha_, he thought, _and she is a monarch._ As a result, he walked a little more erect than even the operations had rendered him.  The dangers of his trade grew less and less frightening as he came to know his way between the universes, even though, at the same time, he began to realize how great those dangers were. He had not conceived of their immensity before. The reason there were asteroid belts in so many of the solar systems, he learned now, was that the xhindi had traded with other intelligent races in earlier eras, and there had been accidents. Those races were now extinct.  The xhindi themselves ceased to be monstrous in his eyes. He grew to accept their appearance as perfectly natural in their universe. Toward the kqyres, he came to feel something of what he had felt toward Schiemann, except that where Schiemann had looked up to him and relied on him, he found himself increasingly dependent on Njeri. He told him all his hopes and ambitions, and the kqyres listened attentively. Mattern tried to explain to him how he himself felt about Lyddy, and the kqyres tried to understand.  The kqyres taught Mattern how to play chess. \"But that's our game!\" Mattern said. \"I mean we play it in our universe!\"  \"In ours also,\" the xhind smiled. \"Who knows whether it came from our universe to yours, or yours to ours? Nor does it matter. It is an old game and a good one.\"  Mattern became increasingly skillful at it. He was pleased that there was an intellectual activity in which he could engage as an equal with the kqyres, and the kqyres seemed pleased, too.         *       *       *       *       *  When the treatments were over, Mattern looked in a mirror. He was straight; he was handsome. His skin was clear, his eyes bright. He looked less than his age. Now he could go back to Lyddy, assured that most women would find his physical appearance more than acceptable.  But he found himself hesitating. Only his physical appearance would be truly acceptable. There was something still lacking in him. His body was right, but the way he stood, the way he moved, the way he spoke, all these were wrong.  \"I'm not finished yet,\" he said stumblingly to the kqyres, \"not quite straightened out. I ought to be more--well, more smooth.\"  \"You do lack polish,\" the kqyres admitted, \"although you are far less awkward, shall we say, than when we first met.\"  \"That's because of you, Njeri!\" Mattern declared, with genuine gratitude. \"You've taught me a lot!\" And he looked at his outlandish friend with a great affection.  The kqyres seemed quite moved; he flickered like a pin-wheel. \"You have been an exceedingly apt pupil, Mattern. When first I saw you, I did not think it possible that I should ever consider you a companion. However, I have found myself taking an increasing pleasure in your company. Sometimes I even forget you are a human.\"  Mattern could not speak; he was so overwhelmed by the tribute.  \"The passage of time disclosed to me that there were sensitivities and perceptions beneath that--forgive me, but we know how misleading first impressions can be--boorish exterior. The very fact that you are conscious of your own deficiencies _proves_ that you are more than the mere clod you still, on occasion, seem to be--\"  \"Can't I improve myself that way, too?\" Mattern asked plaintively. \"Can't I make myself worthy of Lyddy in every way?\"  \"Of course you can,\" the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51844"],["title","Someone to Watch Over Me (#8)"],["body","beamed. \"Were you to apply yourself specifically to the acquisition of culture, I am sure you could become as polished as any human being can hope to be. But it will take time.\"  \"Well,\" Mattern said, \"Lyddy's waited so long, she can wait a little longer. Things worth having are worth waiting for.\"  Under Njeri's tutelage, Mattern cultivated the arts and the amenities. As he used his ship for a permanent residence, it was there that he housed his growing collection of costly rare objects of art, and his library, notable for its first editions--not only of tapes, but of books. His uniforms were cut by the best terrestrial tailors and he took kinescope courses in the liberal arts and social forms from the outstanding universities of Earth. The provincial twang vanished from his speech; he developed a taste for wine and conversation. Nobody, seeing him, could ever have fancied him once a poor wizened space rat.         *       *       *       *       *  As the years went by, he grew to become as much of a ruler in his way as the mbretersha in hers. She ruled one planet, he told himself, but he had a business empire farflung over many planets--all of which, to some extent, he did rule through his investments. He would have worlds to lay at Lyddy's feet now, he thought complacently. No man could offer any woman more.  The first _Hesperian Queen_ didn't have a chance to last out his lifetime; he kept trading her in for another and yet another model, as better, faster, more luxurious starships were developed. Finally, he outbid the Federation Government itself for plans of the latest-model spacecraft. When the government protested, he graciously gave them copies free of all charge. \"I merely wanted to be sure that I had the best ship available,\" he explained. \"I have no objection to your having it also. But I knew that you could not afford to be as generous as I can.\"  He never had more than one ship, because it was too dangerous to run more than one cargo at a time. His crew was always as small in number as possible. He would have preferred none at all; actually, all spaceships could run themselves, for the controls were completely automatic. But regulations said there had to be a crew, both for the sake of \"face\"--many extraterrestrials couldn't seem to recognize the authority of machines--and because a power failure was not inconceivable.  So the _Hesperian Queen_ carried four men. And, whenever she made the Jump through hyperspace, even the crew--though conditioned on Earth--was drugged. Mattern carried on alone. And if, when the crewmen awakened, they found that a day had passed when only an hour should have gone by, they knew better than to ask questions.  So the years went by--busy, pleasant, profitable years. The image of Lyddy was always before him, inspiring him to further efforts. _Someday soon I will go back to her_, he would tell himself. On his latest birthday, he looked in the mirror closely. At twenty-four, he had appeared forty; at forty, he could have passed for thirty. Sixteen years had gone by since that night with Lyddy. Now he was worthy of her or anyone.  \"I think it's time I went back for her,\" he told the kqyres.  \"For whom?\" the kqyres asked; then added hastily, \"Oh, yes, of course, Lyddy. We'll do that right after we come back from the Vega System. There's a little Earth-type planet out there--\"  \"_Before_ we go to Vega,\" Mattern interrupted. \"Now.\"  \"But why the hurry? You've waited so long already--\"  \"I've waited too long. I'm not young any more.\"  \"Neither is she,\" observed the kqyres. \"Perhaps she is too old now, Mattern.\"  \"She can't be too old,\" Mattern said. The tridi in his locker was Lyddy, and the picture was young; therefore, Lyddy must still be young.  \"She may have married someone else. She may have numerous children clustering about her knee.\"  \"Then I will take her away from her husband and children,\" Mattern declared. \"Can you imagine that a little thing like that would stop me?\"  \"She may have lost her beauty,\" the kqyres said. \"She may have left Hesperia. She may have suffered a disfiguring accident.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mattern realized then that Njeri was deliberately trying to keep him from going back to Lyddy. Either he felt that she would interfere with the smooth operation of their business, or he was jealous of a third intruding into their company.  \"I have done everything I did for the sake of winning Lyddy,\" Mattern said, biting off the words. \"If all hope of her is gone, then my whole reason for working with you is gone. I will never go back to hyperspace.\"  \"There are other women--\"  \"Not for me!\"  \"The business itself means nothing to you?\" There was an aggrieved note in the kqyres' voice.  \"It's just a living,\" Mattern said, \"just a way of getting Lyddy. You know that was why I went into it. I thought you'd been listening to me all these years.\"  \"I thought perhaps with the deepening of your interests--\"  \"They have only made me love her the more profoundly.\"  The kqyres took the equivalent of a deep breath. \"You do not have a house or any regular place of residence. You cannot expect a lady to live permanently on a spaceship.\"  \"I will build her a house.\"  \"Will it not show her how carefully you have prepared for her if, first, you build her a palace worthy--\"  \"I have no time to build palaces.\"  \"There is a tiny planet that circles the dim sun you call Van Maanen's star,\" the alien persisted. \"It is always twilight there. The beings who live on that planet build crystal towers miles high and as fragile as spun glass, in dusk colors the rainbow never dreamed of.\"  \"If she wants a crystal tower, I will have one built for her. But first I will ask her.\"  \"Very well,\" the kqyres sighed, \"since nothing else will satisfy you, let us return and fetch her.\"  And when they got to Erytheia City, Lyddy was still there, not only unmarried, but--in spite of all the years--unchanged.   VII  And now Mattern had been her husband for several months. He had begun to know her, and he realized that she could never be let known the truth about his life and his work. She would be frightened, and, if there was any emotion left over in her, angry.  He told the kqyres: \"I've been thinking of taking Lyddy to Burdon. She might find distractions there that will take her mind off--things it shouldn't be on. What do you think of the idea?\"  \"I cannot tell,\" the kqyres replied doubtfully. \"I have a curious feeling....\"  \"That _what_?\" Mattern prompted him anxiously. It was the first time he had seen the kqyres definitely at a loss, although it had seemed to him of recent months that the xhind's assurance was beginning to ebb.  \"... that I am getting too old for my work,\" the kqyres finished.  \"Nonsense!\" Mattern cried. The kqyres was his tower of strength; he _would_ not conceive of any weakness in him. It would mean that he would be forced to rely upon himself. _And yet_, he thought, _I am certainly old and experienced enough by now to begin relying upon myself. In fact, I'm getting a little old and tired, too._  \"You know,\" he said to his partner, \"maybe we both ought to retire.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"You've been at this long enough and I've got all the money I want. We can see each other sometimes; no reason why I couldn't go into hyperspace just to visit.\"  The kqyres paled to pearl. \"Now that you have Lyddy, you don't want anything else at all?\"  \"Now that I have Lyddy, what else is there to want?\"  The kqyres flickered anxiously. \"But the mbretersha has commanded--\"  Mattern smiled. \"Her commands don't hold good in this universe. You know that. When I was a kid, she could fool me into believing she had a hold over me. But the hold is a psychological one; that's the only thing that could carry over from universe to universe. And I'm strong enough to break it now.\"  Although he was not quite serious, it might be, he thought, that the hyperspace trade and the trips to Ferr had spoiled him for everyday life, made him too restless for the mundanities of any world. And it was time for him to settle down now.  He let the kqyres win the game, and then he stood up. \"I'd better start getting things ready for the trip to Burdon.\"  \"You've definitely decided to go?\"  \"Yes,\" Mattern said, pleased with himself, \"definitely.\"  He went to the control room and got out the forms that would need to be filled out before the ship could leave port. Suddenly he remembered his puzzlement about the young spaceman--what was his name?--Raines? He pressed a button on the file, and the boy's records flashed up at him. At first they seemed to be in order: _Alard Raines, aged twenty-five, educated on Earth_, well and good. But _born on Earth_ ... Mattern was almost positive that could never have been, not from the way the young man spoke. And one false statement meant that the whole record was false.  However, he could not challenge the discrepancy before they left for Capella. If he spoke to Raines, he'd probably have to dismiss him then and there. It would be difficult to find a suitable replacement in Erytheia City. He might have to send for someone from Earth, which would take months, perhaps a year. First he'd take the _Queen_ to Burdon, he decided, and then he would fire Raines.         *       *       *       *       *  Nearly three weeks went by before they could leave. Mattern found himself looking forward with some impatience to Burdon. When Lyddy had a house of her own that she could take an interest in, he told himself, things would be different; she would be different. This way she was bored much of the time, and boredom is contagious.  \"I've 'vised ahead to Capella, dear,\" he told her as they boarded ship, \"and rented a furnished multiplex, so we'll have some place to stay.\"  \"Yes, honey,\" she said, with a strange lack of interest. She didn't even seem surprised at the size of the ship. Underneath her elaborate makeup, she was pale; her body was trembling. She saw"]]]
