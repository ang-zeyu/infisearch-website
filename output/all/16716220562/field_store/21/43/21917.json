Those boys really know their stuff. Maybe I _will_ have my nose fixed next time I go Earthside.\"  Clarey glared venomously at the tall, handsome, dark young officer.  \"Don't worry,\" Blynn soothed him. \"I'm sure when you go back they'll be able to make you look exactly the way you were before.\"  He gave Clarey a general briefing and explained to him that the additional allowance he'd be receiving--since he couldn't be expected to live on a Damorlant salary--would come from an alleged rich aunt in Barshwat.  \"Where'll you get the native currency?\" Clarey asked.  \"We do some restricted trading with the natives, bring materials that're in short supply; salt, breakfast cereals, pigments, thread--stuff like that. Nothing strategic, nothing they could possibly use against us ... unless they decide to strangle us with our own string.\" He guffawed ear-splittingly.         *       *       *       *       *  One rainy evening a couple of Earth officers hustled Clarey into a hax-cart. A little later, equipped with a native kit, an itinerary, and a ticket purchased in Ventimor, he was left a short distance from a large track-car station.  He was so numb with fright he had to force himself to move in the right direction leg by leg. He gained a little confidence when he was able to find the terminus without needing to ask directions; he even managed to find the right chain of cars and a place to sit in one of them. He didn't realize that this was something of an achievement until he discovered that certain later arrivals had to stand. He wondered why more tickets were issued than there were seats available, then realized the answer was simple--primitives couldn't count very accurately.  Creakily and slowly, the chain got under way. Clarey's terror mounted. Here he was, wearing strange clothes, on a strange world, surrounded by strange creatures. They aren't really repulsive, he told himself; they look like people; they look like me.  Some of the natives seemed to be staring at him. His heart began to beat loudly. Could they hear it? Did their hearts beat the same way? Was their hearing more acute than his? The tapes had seemed so full of information; now he saw how full of holes they'd been. Then he noticed that the natives were staring at each other. His heart quieted. Only a local custom. After a while, little conversational groups formed. No one spoke to him, for he spoke to no one. He was not yet ready to thrust himself upon them; he had enough to do to reach his destination successfully.  He tried to follow the conversations for practice and to keep his mind off his fears. The male next to him was talking to the male opposite about the weather and its effect on the sirtles. The three females on his other side were telling each other how their respective offspring were doing in school. Some voices he couldn't identify with owners were complaining how much sagor and titulwirt cost these days. I don't know why the government is so worried, he thought; they're not really very human at all.  The chain had been scheduled to reach the end of its run in three hours. It took closer to five. He got off at what would have been around midnight on Earth, and the terminus where he was supposed to take the next chain was almost empty of people, completely empty of cars. Although it was still a few minutes before his car was due, he was worried. Finally, he approached a native.  \"Is this--is this not where the 39:12 to Zrig is destined to appear?\" he asked, conscious as he uttered Vangtort aloud for the first time that his phrasing was not entirely colloquial.  The native stared at him with small pale eyes and bit his middle finger. \"Stranger, eh?\" he asked in a small pale voice.  \"Yes.\" The native waited. \"I come from Ventimor,\" Clarey told him. Nosy native, he thought furiously; prying primitive.  \"You don't hafta shout,\" the native said. \"I'm not deef.\"  Clarey realized what he hadn't noted consciously before--the natives spoke much more softly than Earthmen. Local custom two.  \"You'll be finding things a lot different here in Vangtor,\" the native told him. \"Livelier, more up to date. F'rinstance, do the cars always run on time in Ventimor?\"  \"Yes,\" Clarey said firmly.  \"Well, they don't here. Know why? That's because we've got more'n one chain of 'em.\" He made a noise like a wounded turshi. He was laughing.         *       *       *       *       *  Clarey smiled until his gums ached. \"About the 39:12? It is rather important to me, as I understand the next chain does not leave for several days.\"  The native lifted a chronometer hanging around his neck. \"Ought to get in around 40 or so,\" he said. \"Whyn't you get yourself a female or a bite to eat?\" He waved his hand toward the two trade booths that were still open for business.  Clarey was very hungry. But, as he got near the food booth, the stench and the sight of the utensils were too much for him. He went back to the carways and sat huddled on a banquette until his chain came in at 40:91.  The car he picked was empty, so he stretched out on the seat and slept until it got to Zrig, very early in the morning. When he got out, day was dawning and a food booth hadn't had time to accumulate odors so he climbed to one of the perches and pointed to something that looked like a lopsided pie and something else that looked like coffee. Neither was what it appeared to be, but the pseudo-pie was edible and the pseudo-coffee was good. Somehow, the food seemed to diminish his fright; it made the world less strange.  \"Where you going, stranger?\" the native asked, resting his arms on the top of the booth.  \"Katund,\" Clarey said. The other looked puzzled. \"It is a village near Zrig.\"  \"That a fact?\" The native bit his little finger. \"You look like a city feller to me.\"  \"That is correct,\" Clarey said patiently. \"I come from Qytet. It is a place of some size.\" He waited a decent interval before collapsing his smile.  \"Now, why would a smart-looking young fellow like you want to go to a place like this Katund, eh?\"  Clarey started to shrug, then remembered that was not a Damorlant gesture. \"I have received employment there.\"  \"I should think you'd be able to do better'n that.\" The native nibbled at his thumb. \"What did you say you worked at?\"  \"I didn't. I am a librarian.\"  The native turned away and began to rinse his utensils. \"In that case, I guess Katund's as good a place as any.\"  Surely, Clarey thought, even a Damorlant would at this point rise up and smite the food merchant with one of his own platters. Then he forgot his anger in apprehension. What in the name of whatever gods they worshipped on this planet could a librarian possibly be?  He got up and was about to go. Then he remembered to be friendly and outgoing. \"I have never tasted better food,\" he told the native. \"Not even in Barshwat.\"  The native picked up the coin Clarey had left by way of tip and bit it. Apparently it passed the test. \"Stop here next time you're passing this way,\" he advised, \"and I'll really serve you something to write home about!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The omnibus for Katund proved to be nothing but a large cart drawn by a team of hax. Clarey waited for internal manifestations as he rode. None came. I've found my land legs, he thought, or, rather, my land stomach. And with the hax jogging along the quiet lanes of Vangtor, he found himself almost at peace.  Earth was completely urbanized: there were the great metropolises; there were the parks; there were the oceans. That was all. So to him the Vangtort countryside looked like a huge park, with grass and trees and flowers that were slightly unrealistic in color, but beautiful just the same--even more, perhaps. It was idyllic. There's bound to be some catch, he thought.  The other passengers, who'd been talking together in low tones, turned toward Clarey. \"You'll be the new librarian, I take it?\" the tallest observed. He was a bulky creature, wearing a rich but sober cloak that came down to his ankles.  For a moment Clarey couldn't understand him; the local dialect seemed to thicken the words. \"Why, yes. How did you know that?\"  The native wiggled his ears. \"Not many folks come to Katund and a new librarian's expected, so it wasn't hard to figure. Except you don't look my idea of a librarian.\"  Clarey nervously smoothed the dark red cloak that covered him from shoulder to mid-calf. Was it too loud? Too quiet? Too short?  \"What give you the idea of comin' to Katund?\" the oldest and smallest of the three asked in a whistling voice. \"It's no place anybody who wasn't born here'd choose.\"  \"Most young fellers favor the city,\" the third--a barrel-shaped individual--agreed. \"I'd of gone there myself when I was a lad, if Dad hadn't needed somebody to take over the Purple Furbush when he was gone.\"  \"Maybe he's runnin' away,\" the ancient sibilated. \"When I was a boy, there was a feller from the city came here; turned out to be a thief.\" All three stared at Clarey.  \"I--I replied to an advertisement in the Dordonec District Bulletin,\" he said carefully. \"I wished for a position that was peaceful and quiet. I am recovering from an overset of the nervous system.\"  The oldest one said, \"That'd account for it right enough.\"  Clarey gritted his teeth and beamed at them.  \"Typical idiot smile,\" the ancient whispered. \"Noticed it myself right off, but I didn't like to say.\"  \"Is it right to have a librarian that isn't all there?\" the proprietor of the Furbush asked. \"Foreigner, too. I mean to say--the young ones use him more'n most.\"  \"We've got to take what we can get,\" the biggest native said. \"Katund's funds are running mighty low.\"  \"What can you expect when you ballot yourself a salary raise every year?\" the old one whistled. The other two"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51867"],["title","Sentry of the Sky (#4)"],["body","animal noises. Clarey must not jump; he must learn to laugh like a turshi if he hoped to be the life of any Damorlant party.         *       *       *       *       *  The big one stood up as well as he could in the swaying cart. \"Guess I'd better introduce myself,\" he said, holding out a sturdily shod foot. \"I'm Malesor, headman of Katund. This is Piq; he deals in blots and snarls. And Hanxi here's the inn-keeper.\"  \"My name is Balt,\" Clarey said. \"I am honored by this meeting.\" And he went through the conventional toe-touching with each one.  \"Guess you'll be putting up with me until you've found permanent quarters, Til Balt,\" Hanxi said. \"Not that you could do much better than make your permanent home at the Purple Furbush. You'll find life more comfortable than if you lodge with a private fam'ly. Bein' a young unmarried man--\" he twisted his nose suggestively--\"you'd naturally want a bit of freedom, excitement.\"  \"Remember he's a librarian,\" Piq whistled. \"He might not appreciate as good a time as most young fellers.\"  Clarey was glad when a cluster of domes appearing over the horizon indicated that they'd reached Katund. He looked about him curiously. The countryside he'd been able to equate with a park, but this small aggregate of detached dwellings bore no relationship to anything in his experience.  His kit was dexterously removed from his hand. \"Guess you'll want to check in first,\" Hanxi said, \"so I'll just take your gear over to the inn for you.\"  He pointed out a small dome shading from lavender at the bottom to rose pink on top. Over the door were glittering symbols which Clarey was able to decipher after a moment's concentration as \"Dordonec District Public Library--Katund Branch,\" and underneath, in smaller letters, \"Please Blow Nose Before Entering.\"  Hesitantly, he touched the screen that covered the portway. It rolled back. He went inside.  At his first sight of what filled the shelves from floor to topmost curve of the dome, Clarey became charged with fury. The ancient books in the glass cases back on Earth were of a different shape and substance, but, \"My God,\" he cried aloud, \"it's nothing but another archive!\"  The female in charge glared at him. \"Silence, please!\"  Suddenly the anger left him, and the fear. He was no longer a stranger on a strange world. He was an archivist in an archive.  She took a better look at him and the local equivalent of a bright smile shone on her face. \"May I help you, til?\" she asked in a softer, sweeter voice.  \"I am Balt, til,\" he said. \"I am the new librarian.\"  She came out from behind the desk to offer the ceremonial toe touch. \"I'm Embelsira, the head librarian, and I am very glad to see you!\" Her tone was warm; she really seemed to mean it. \"Everything's in such a mess,\" she went on. \"I've needed help so very badly, so very long.\" She looked up at him, for she was a good deal shorter than he. \"So glad,\" she murmured, \"so very, very glad to see you, really.\"  \"Well, now you have help,\" he said with quiet strength. \"Where are the files?\"  They were written instead of punched, of alien design, in an alien language, arranged according to alien patterns, but he understood them at a glance. \"These will need to be re-organized from top to bottom,\" he said.  \"Yes, Til Balt,\" she said demurely. \"Whatever you say.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Once every six months, Clarey went for a long weekend to visit his \"Aunt Askidush\" in Barshwat. Barshwat was the largest city on Damorlan; it was the capital of Vintnor--the greatest nation. Earthmen, Clarey thought, as he traveled there in the comparative luxury of a first-class compartment--as a rich nephew, he saw no real reason to travel third-class--were disgustingly obvious.  That first time, he was five hours late, and Blynn was a nervous wreck. \"I was afraid you'd been killed or discovered or God knows,\" he babbled, practically embracing Clarey in a fervency of relief. \"I was afraid--\"  \"Come, come, Colonel,\" Clarey interrupted, striding past him, \"you know how inefficient Damorlant transport is, and I had to make two chain connections.\"  \"Of course,\" the colonel said, wiping the perspiration off his forehead. \"Of course. And you must be dead tired. Sit down; let me take your cloak--\"  \"How about the servants?\" Clarey asked.  \"This is their weekend off.\" Blynn pulled himself together. \"Really, my dear fellow, I've been in this business longer than you. I know what precautions to take.\"  \"Never can be too careful.\"  \"I see you've got yourself another cloak,\" the colonel said as he hung it in the guest snap. \"Very handsome. I've never seen one like it.\"  \"Yes. As a matter of fact, several people on the chains wanted to know where I'd got it.\"  \"Where _did_ you get it?\" asked Blynn, feeling the material. \"Might go well as an export.\"  \"Afraid it couldn't be exported. It's a custom job, you see. Hand-woven, hand-decorated. It was a birthday present.\"  The colonel stared at him.  \"Well,\" Clarey said, \"if you didn't expect me to get birthday presents, you shouldn't have put a birth date on my identity papers. My boss baked me a melxhane--\"  \"Your boss!\"  \"The relationship between employer and employee is much different from the way it is on Earth,\" Clarey explained. Reaching over, he flipped the switch on the recorder and repeated the statement, adding, \"Embelsira is kind, considerate, helpful; she can't do enough for me.\" He put his mouth close to the mechanism. \"Be sure to tell MacFingal that.\"  \"Now, now,\" the colonel said, turning the switch off. He pushed a small tea wagon over to Clarey. \"You must be starving. Have some sandwiches and coffee. I'm sure you'll be glad to taste good Earth food again.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" Clarey said, trying not to make a face. \"Er--shouldn't we start recording while everything's fresh in my mind?\"  \"Might as well,\" the colonel said, flipping the switch again. \"Pity we don't have a probe here. Would save so much time. But, of course, it's an expensive installation. All right, Clarey, over to you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Clarey choked on a mouthful of sandwich and hesitated. \"Begin with your very first impressions,\" the colonel urged.  \"Well, the archives--the library--was in a real mess. Took me over two weeks to get it in even roughly decent shape. Three different systems of classification and, added to that--\"  \"Not so much the library, old chap. Leave the technical stuff for later. What I meant was your first impressions of the natives.... Is something wrong with the coffee? And you've hardly touched your sandwich. Maybe you'd like another kind. I have several varieties here--ham and cheese and--\"  \"Oh, no,\" Clarey protested. \"The one I have is fine. It's just that I'm--well, to tell you the truth,\" he confessed, \"I've grown accustomed to Damorlant food.\"  \"Don't see how you could,\" the colonel said. \"Nauseating stuff--to my way of thinking,\" he added politely. He opened a sandwich and inspected the filling.  \"You've only eaten at public places. Even the better restaurants don't put themselves out for Earthmen, say they have no--palates, I guess the word would be. But you ought to taste my landlady's cooking!\"  \"All this is being taped, you know. They'll have to listen to every word on Earth.\"  \"If only I could convey the true picture through words. Her ragouts are rhapsodies, her soufflés symphonies--I'm using rough Terrestrial equivalents, of course--\"  \"The cuisine comes later, please. Over-all impressions first.\"  \"Well,\" Clarey began again, \"at first I was a bit surprised that you'd stuck me in a quarter-credit place like Katund. Naturally in a village the people'd be more backward than in the cities, so you'd have a poorer idea of how they were developing. Then I realized that you couldn't help putting me there, that you probably couldn't write a letter good enough to get me a job in any of the big centers. Embelsira said she was surprised to find me so much more literate than she would have expected from the letter.\"  The colonel sat erect huffily. \"I've never pretended to be a philologist. And, anyway, Damorlan isn't like Earth. Here the heartbeat of the planet is in its villages.\"  \"Earth hasn't any villages, so the comparison doesn't apply.\" Clarey cleared his throat. \"Don't you have anything to drink except coffee?\"  \"Tea?\"  \"That would be better. Do you know the Katundi have a special variety of tea, or something very like it, which is--\"  \"Tell me what they think of Earthmen,\" the colonel interrupted desperately.  \"Not much. What I mean is, nobody in Katund's actually had any contact with them, though they've heard of them, of course. Every now and then there's a little article in the Dordonec Bulletin from their Barshwat correspondent, and sometimes, if there isn't any real news, he gives a couple of inches to the Earthmen.\"  \"Exactly how do they regard us?\" the colonel asked as he spooned tea into the pot. \"Demi-gods? Superior beings? Are they in great awe of us?\"  \"They regard us as visitors from another planet,\" Clarey said. \"They don't realize from quite how far away we hail, think it's only a matter of a solar system or two, but they've got the general idea. Don't forget, they may not be a mechanical people, but they do have some idea of astronomy. They're not illiterate clods.\"  \"What do they think of our spaceships? Great silver birds, something like that?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sighing deeply, Clarey said, \"They think our spaceships are cars that fly through the sky without tracks. And they think it's silly, our having machines to fly in the sky and none to go on the ground. There's an old Dordonec proverb: 'One must run before one must fly.' Originally applied to birds, but--\"  \"But what else do they think about us?\"  Clarey was hurt. \"That's what I was getting to, if you'll only give me time. After all, I've been speaking Vangtort for six months and it's a little hard to go back to Terran and organize"]]]
