It is of key importance. The list of men he was treating was an extremely vital one. That work cannot be interrupted now.\"  \"How can you accomplish anything by operating only here?\" Curt objected. \"While you stifle our defenses, our enemies are arming to the teeth. When you've made us sufficiently helpless, they'll strike.\"  \"Did I say we were so restricted?\" answered Sark, smiling for the first time. \"You cannot imagine what a fresh vegetable means on a professor's table in Moscow. In Atomgrad a ripe tomato is worth a pound of uranium. How do I know? Because I walked the streets of Atomgrad with my grandfather.\"  \"Then you're a--\"  Sark's face grew hard and bitter in the half light of the room. \"Was,\" he corrected. \"Or might have been. There are no nationalities where there are no nations, no political parties where there are only hunger and death. The crime of the future is not any person's or country's. It is the whole of humanity's.\"  An alarm sounded abruptly.  \"Carlson!\" someone tensely exclaimed.  Sark whirled to the panels and adjusted the controls. A small screen lighted, showing the image of a man with graying hair and imperious face. His sharp eyes seemed to burn directly into Curt's.  \"How did it go?\" exclaimed Sark. \"Was the Prime Continuum shift as expected?\"  \"No! It still doesn't compute out. Nothing's right. The war is still going on. The Continuum is absolute hell.\"  \"I should have known,\" said Sark in dismay. \"I should have called you.\"  \"What is it? Do you know what's wrong?\"  \"Johnson. Dr. Curtis Johnson. He's here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rage spread upon Carlson's face. An oath exploded from his lips. \"No wonder the situation doesn't compute with him out of the Prime Continuum. Why did he come there?\"  \"Dell sent him. Dell died too quickly. He didn't have time to instruct Johnson. I have told him what we want of him.\"  \"Do you understand?\" Carlson demanded of Curt with abruptness that was almost anger.  Curt looked slowly about the room and back to the face of his questioner. Understand? If they sent him back, allowed him to go back, could he ever be sure that he had not witnessed a thing of nightmare in this shadowy dream world?  Yes, he could be sure. He had seen the blasted city, just the way he knew it could be--_would_ be unless someone prevented it. He had seen the pattern on the scope, attuned to the tiny tributary of the Prime Continuum that was the life of Dr. Dell, had seen it run out, dying as Dell had died.  He could believe, too, that there was a little farm near Atomgrad, where a tomato on a scientist's table was more potent than the bombs building in the arsenal.  \"I understand,\" he said. \"Shall I go back now?\"  Sark put a paper into his hands. \"Here is a list of new names. You will find Dell's procedures and records in his desk at the farm. Do not underestimate the importance of your work. You have seen the failure of the Prime Continuum to compute properly with you out of it. You will correct that.  \"Your only contact from now on will be through Brown, who will bring the tank truck once a year. You know what to do. You are on your own.\"  It was like a surrealist painting as he left. The moon had risen, and in all the barrenness there was nothing but the gray cement cube of the building. The light spilling through the open doorway touched the half dozen gaunt men who had followed him out to the car. Ahead was the narrow band of roadway leading through some infinite nothingness that would end in Dell's truck farm.         *       *       *       *       *  He started off. When he looked back a moment later, the building was no longer there.  He glanced at the list of names Sark gave him, chilled by the importance of those men. For some there would be death as there had been for Dell. For himself--  He had forgotten to ask. But perhaps they would not have told him. Not at this time, anyway. The chemically treated food produced tumors in refractory, unresponsive cells. He had eaten Dell's vegetables, would eat more.  It was too late to ask and it didn't matter. He had important things to do. First would be the writing of his resignation to the officials of Camp Detrick.  As of tomorrow, he would be Dr. Curtis Johnson, truck farmer, specialist in atomic-age produce, luscious table gifts for the innocent and not-so-innocent human matches that would, if he and his unknown colleagues succeeded, be prevented from cremating the hopes of Mankind.  Louise would help him hang the new sign:      YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT         Eat the Best         EAT JOHNSON'S          VEGETABLES  Only, of course, she wouldn't know why he had taken Dell's job, nor could he ever explain.  It would probably be the death of Curt Johnson, but that was cheap enough if humanity survived."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51082"],["title","Coming Attraction (#0)"],["body","Attraction                              BY FRITZ LEIBER                         Illustrated by Paul Calle             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                  Galaxy Science Fiction November 1950.

The coupe with the fishhooks welded to the fender shouldered up over the curb like the nose of a nightmare. The girl in its path stood frozen, her face probably stiff with fright under her mask. For once my reflexes weren't shy. I took a fast step toward her, grabbed her elbow, yanked her back. Her black skirt swirled out.  The big coupe shot by, its turbine humming. I glimpsed three faces. Something ripped. I felt the hot exhaust on my ankles as the big coupe swerved back into the street. A thick cloud like a black flower blossomed from its jouncing rear end, while from the fishhooks flew a black shimmering rag.  \"Did they get you?\" I asked the girl.  She had twisted around to look where the side of her skirt was torn away. She was wearing nylon tights.  \"The hooks didn't touch me,\" she said shakily. \"I guess I'm lucky.\"  I heard voices around us:  \"Those kids! What'll they think up next?\"  \"They're a menace. They ought to be arrested.\"  Sirens screamed at a rising pitch as two motor-police, their rocket-assist jets full on, came whizzing toward us after the coupe. But the black flower had become a thick fog obscuring the whole street. The motor-police switched from rocket assists to rocket brakes and swerved to a stop near the smoke cloud.  \"Are you English?\" the girl asked me. \"You have an English accent.\"  Her voice came shudderingly from behind the sleek black satin mask. I fancied her teeth must be chattering. Eyes that were perhaps blue searched my face from behind the black gauze covering the eyeholes of the mask. I told her she'd guessed right. She stood close to me. \"Will you come to my place tonight?\" she asked rapidly. \"I can't thank you now. And there's something you can help me about.\"  My arm, still lightly circling her waist, felt her body trembling. I was answering the plea in that as much as in her voice when I said, \"Certainly.\" She gave me an address south of Inferno, an apartment number and a time. She asked me my name and I told her.  \"Hey, you!\"  I turned obediently to the policeman's shout. He shooed away the small clucking crowd of masked women and barefaced men. Coughing from the smoke that the black coupe had thrown out, he asked for my papers. I handed him the essential ones.         *       *       *       *       *  He looked at them and then at me. \"British Barter? How long will you be in New York?\"  Suppressing the urge to say, \"For as short a time as possible,\" I told him I'd be here for a week or so.  \"May need you as a witness,\" he explained. \"Those kids can't use smoke on us. When they do that, we pull them in.\"  He seemed to think the smoke was the bad thing. \"They tried to kill the lady,\" I pointed out.  He shook his head wisely. \"They always pretend they're going to, but actually they just want to snag skirts. I've picked up rippers with as many as fifty skirt-snags tacked up in their rooms. Of course, sometimes they come a little too close.\"  I explained that if I hadn't yanked her out of the way, she'd have been hit by more than hooks. But he interrupted, \"If she'd thought it was a real murder attempt, she'd have stayed here.\"  I looked around. It was true. She was gone.  \"She was fearfully frightened,\" I told him.  \"Who wouldn't be? Those kids would have scared old Stalin himself.\"  \"I mean frightened of more than 'kids.' They didn't look like 'kids.'\"  \"What did they look like?\"  I tried without much success to describe the three faces. A vague impression of viciousness and effeminacy doesn't mean much.  \"Well, I could be wrong,\" he said finally. \"Do you know the girl? Where she lives?\"  \"No,\" I half lied.  The other policeman hung up his radiophone and ambled toward us, kicking at the tendrils of dissipating smoke. The black cloud no longer hid the dingy facades with their five-year-old radiation flash-burns, and I could begin to make out the distant stump of the Empire State Building, thrusting up out of Inferno like a mangled finger.  \"They haven't been picked up so far,\" the approaching policeman grumbled. \"Left smoke for five blocks, from what Ryan says.\"  The first policeman shook his head. \"That's bad,\" he observed solemnly.  I was feeling a bit uneasy and ashamed. An Englishman shouldn't lie, at least not on impulse.  \"They sound like nasty customers,\" the first policeman continued in the same grim tone. \"We'll need witnesses. Looks as if you may have to stay in New York longer than you expect.\"  I got the point. I said, \"I forgot to show you all my papers,\" and handed him a few others, making sure there was a five dollar bill in among them.         *       *       *       *       *  When he handed them back a bit later, his voice was no longer ominous. My feelings of guilt vanished. To cement our relationship, I chatted with the two of them about their job.  \"I suppose the masks give you some trouble,\" I observed. \"Over in England we've been reading about your new crop of masked female bandits.\"  \"Those things get exaggerated,\" the first policeman assured me. \"It's the men masking as women that really mix us up. But, brother, when we nab them, we jump on them with both feet.\"  \"And you get so you can spot women almost as well as if they had naked faces,\" the second policeman volunteered. \"You know, hands and all that.\"  \"Especially all that,\" the first agreed with a chuckle. \"Say, is it true that some girls don't mask over in England?\"  \"A number of them have picked up the fashion,\" I told him. \"Only a few, though--the ones who always adopt the latest style, however extreme.\"  \"They're usually masked in the British newscasts.\"  \"I imagine it's arranged that way out of deference to American taste,\" I confessed. \"Actually, not very many do mask.\"  The second policeman considered that. \"Girls going down the street bare from the neck up.\" It was not clear whether he viewed the prospect with relish or moral distaste. Likely both.  \"A few members keep trying to persuade Parliament to enact a law forbidding all masking,\" I continued, talking perhaps a bit too much.  The second policeman shook his head. \"What an idea. You know, masks are a pretty good thing, brother. Couple of years more and I'm going to make my wife wear hers around the house.\"  The first policeman shrugged. \"If women were to stop wearing masks, in six weeks you wouldn't know the difference. You get used to anything, if enough people do or don't do it.\"  I agreed, rather regretfully, and left them. I turned north on Broadway (old Tenth Avenue, I believe) and walked rapidly until I was beyond Inferno. Passing such an area of undecontaminated radioactivity always makes a person queasy. I thanked God there weren't any such in England, as yet.  The street was almost empty, though I was accosted by a couple of beggars with faces tunneled by H-bomb scars, whether real or of makeup putty, I couldn't tell. A fat woman held out a baby with webbed fingers and toes. I told myself it would have been deformed anyway and that she was only capitalizing on our fear of bomb-induced mutations. Still, I gave her a seven-and-a-half-cent piece. Her mask made me feel I was paying tribute to an African fetish.  \"May all your children be blessed with one head and two eyes, sir.\"  \"Thanks,\" I said, shuddering, and hurried past her.  \"... There's only trash behind the mask, so turn your head, stick to your task: Stay away, stay away--from--the--girls!\"         *       *       *       *       *  This last was the end of an anti-sex song being sung by some religionists half a block from the circle-and-cross insignia of a femalist temple. They reminded me only faintly of our small tribe of British monastics. Above their heads was a jumble of billboards advertising predigested foods, wrestling instruction, radio handies and the like.  I stared at the hysterical slogans with disagreeable fascination. Since the female face and form have been banned on American signs, the very letters of the advertiser's alphabet have begun to crawl with sex--the fat-bellied, big-breasted capital B, the lascivious double O. However, I reminded myself, it is chiefly the mask that so strangely accents sex in America.  A British anthropologist has pointed out, that, while it took more than 5,000 years to shift the chief point of sexual interest from the hips to the breasts, the next transition to the face has taken less than 50 years. Comparing the American style with Moslem tradition is not valid; Moslem women are compelled to wear veils, the purpose of which is concealment, while American women have only the compulsion of fashion and use masks to create mystery.  Theory aside, the actual origins of the trend are to be found in the anti-radiation clothing of World War III, which led to masked wrestling, now a fantastically popular sport, and that in turn led to the current female fashion. Only a wild style at first, masks quickly became as necessary as brassieres and lipsticks had been earlier in the century.  I finally realized that I was not speculating about masks in general, but about what lay behind one in particular. That's the devil of the things; you're never sure whether a girl is heightening loveliness or hiding ugliness. I pictured a cool, pretty face in which fear showed only in widened eyes. Then I remembered her blonde hair, rich against the blackness of the satin mask. She'd told me to come at the twenty-second hour--ten p.m.  I climbed to my apartment near the British Consulate; the elevator shaft had been shoved out of plumb by an old blast, a nuisance in these "]]]
