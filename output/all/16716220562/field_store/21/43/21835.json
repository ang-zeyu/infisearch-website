I began to see that this opposability of the two types was one of the great driving forces of the people.  In the evening I was transported to the night club and I was a success. I would not entertain them with blue jokes or blue lyrics, but the patrons seemed fascinated by my simple imitations of all the instruments of the orchestra and my singing of comic ballads that Eustace had taught me in odd moments that day. They were also interested in the way that I drank gin--that is, emptying the bottle without breaking the seal. (It seems that the grub-people are unable to absorb a liquid without making direct contact with it.)  And I met Margaret, one of the \"girl\" singers.  I had been wondering to which type of people I might show affinity. Now I knew. I was definitely a Beta type, for I was attracted to Margaret, who was unmistakably a Gamma. I began to understand the queer effect that these types have on each other.  She came over to my cage.  \"I want to rub your head for good luck before I go on,\" she said.  \"Thank you, Margaret,\" I replied, \"but that is not my head.\"  She sang with incomparable sadness, with all the sorrow and sordidness that appear to be the lot of unfortunate Gammas. It was the essence of melancholy made into music. It was a little bit like the ghost music on the asteroid Artemis, a little like the death chants on Dolmena. Sex and sorrow. Nostalgia. Regret.  Her singing shook me with a yearning that had no precedent.  She came back to my cage.  \"You were wonderful, Margaret,\" I said.  \"I'm always wonderful when I'm singing for my supper. I am less wonderful in the rare times that I am well fed. But are you happy, little buddy?\"  \"I had become almost so, till I heard you sing. Now I am overcome with sorrow and longing. Margaret, I am fascinated with you.\"  \"I go for you too, blob. You're my buddy. Isn't it funny that the only buddy I have in the world is a blob? But if you'd seen some of the guys I've been married to--boy! I wouldn't insult you by calling them blobs. Have to go now. See you tomorrow night--if they keep us both on.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Now there was a problem to face. It was necessary that I establish control over my environment, and at once. How else could I aspire to Margaret?  I knew that the heart of the entire place here was neither the bar nor the entertainment therein, nor the cuisine, nor the dancing. The heart of the enterprise was the Casino. Here was the money that mattered; the rest was but garnish.  I had them bring me into the gambling rooms.  I had expected problems of complexity here with which the patrons worked for their gain or loss. Instead there was an almost amazing simplicity. All the games were based on first aspect numbers only. Indeed, everything on the Planet Florida seemed based on first aspect numbers.  Now it is an elemental fact that first aspect numbers do not carry within them their own prediction. Nor were the people even possessed of the prediction key that lies over the very threshold of the second aspect series.  These people were actually wagering sums--the symbols of prosperity--blindly, not knowing for sure whether they would win or lose. They were selecting numbers by hunch or at random with no assurance of profit. They were choosing a hole for a ball to fall into without knowing whether that was the right hole!  I do not believe that I was ever so amazed at anything in my life.  But here was my opportunity to establish control over my environment.  I began to play the games.  Usually I would watch a round first, to be sure that I understood just what was going on. Then I would play a few times ... as many as it took to break the game.  I broke game after game. When he could no longer pay me, Blackjack closed the Casino in exasperation.  Then we played poker, he and I and several others. This was even more simple. I suddenly realized that the grub-people could see only one side of the cards at a time.  I played and I won.  I owned the Casino now, and all of those people were now working for me. Billy Wilkins also played with us, so that in short order I also owned the Reptile Ranch.  Before the evening was over, I owned a race track, a beach hotel, and a theater in a place named New York.  I had begun to establish control over my environment....         *       *       *       *       *  Later. Now started the golden days. I increased my control and did what I could for my friends.  I got a good doctor for my old friend and roommate, Pete the python, and he began receiving treatment for his indigestion. I got a jazzy sports car for my friend Eustace imported from somewhere called Italy. And I buried Margaret in mink, for she had a fix on the fur of that mysterious animal. She enjoyed draping it about her in the form of coats, capes, cloaks, mantles and stoles, though the weather didn't really require it.  I had now won several banks, a railroad, an airline, and a casino in somewhere named Havana.  \"You're somebody now,\" said Margaret. \"You really ought to dress better. Or are you dressed? I never know. I don't know if part of that is clothes or if all of it is you. But at least I've learned which is your head. I think we should be married in May. It's so common to be married in June. Just imagine me being Mrs. George Albert Leroy Ellery McIntosh! You know, we have become quite an item. And do you know there are three biographies of you out--_Burgeoning Blob_, _The Blob from Way Out_, _The Hidden Hand Behind the Blob--What Does it Portend?_ And the governor has invited us to dine tomorrow. I do wish you would learn to eat. If you weren't so nice, you'd be creepy. I always say there's nothing wrong with marrying a man, or a blob, with money. It shows foresight on the part of a girl. You know you will have to get a blood test? You had better get it tomorrow. You do have blood, don't you?\"  I did, but not, of course, of the color and viscosity of hers. But I could give it that color and viscosity temporarily. And it would react negative in all the tests.  She mused, \"They are all jealous of me. They say they wouldn't marry a blob. They mean they couldn't.... Do you have to carry that tin ball with you all the time?\"  \"Yes. It is my communication sphere. In it I record my thoughts. I would be lost without it.\"  \"Oh, like a diary. How quaint!\"  Yes, those were the golden days. The grubs appeared to me in a new light, for was not Margaret also a grub? Yet she seemed not so unfinished as the rest. Though lacking a natural outer casing, she had not the appearance of crawling out from under a rock. She was quite an attractive \"girl.\" And she cared for me.  What more could I wish? I was affluent. I was respected. I was in control of my environment. And I could aid my friends, of whom I had now acquired an astonishing number.  Moreover, my old space-ineptitude sickness had left me. I never felt better in my life. Ah, golden days, one after the other like a pleasant dream. And soon I am to be married!   IV  There has been a sudden change. As on the Planet Hecube, where full summer turns into the dead of the winter in minutes, to the destruction of many travelers, so was it here. My world is threatened!  It is tottering, all that I have built up. I will fight. I will have the best lawyers on the planet. I am not done. But I am threatened....  Later. This may be the end. The appeal court has given its decision. A blob may not own property in Florida. A blob is not a person.  Of course I am not a person. I never pretended to be. But I am a _personage_! I will yet fight this thing....  Later. I have lost everything. The last appeal is gone. By definition, I am an animal of indeterminate origin, and my property is being completely stripped from me.  I made an eloquent appeal and it moved them greatly. There were tears in their eyes. But there was greed in the set of their mouths. They have a vested interest in stripping me. Each will seize a little.  And I am left a pauper, a vassal, an animal, a slave. This is always the last doom of the marooned, to be a despised alien at the mercy of a strange world.  Yet it should not be hopeless. I will have Margaret. Since my contract with Billy Wilkins and Blackjack Bracken, long since bought up, is no longer in effect, Margaret should be able to handle my affairs as a person. I believe that I have great earning powers yet, and I can win as much as I wish by gambling. We will treat this as only a technicality. We shall acquire new fortune. I will reestablish control over my environment. I will bring back the golden days. A few of my old friends are still loyal to me, Margaret, Pete the python, Eustace....  Later. The world has caved in completely. Margaret has thrown me over.  \"I'm sorry, blobby,\" she said, \"but it just won't work. You're still nice, but without money you are only a blob. How could I marry a blob?\"  \"But we can earn more money! I am talented.\"  \"No, you're box-office poison now. You were a fad, and fads die quickly.\"  \"But, Margaret, I can win as much as I wish by gambling.\"  \"Not a chance, blobby. Nobody will gamble with you any more. You're through, blob. I will miss you, though. There will be a new blue note in my ballads when I sing for my supper, after the mink coats are all gone. 'By now.\"  \"Margaret, do not leave me! What of all our golden days together?\"  But all she said was \"'By now.\"  And she was gone forever.         *       *       *       *       *  I am desolate and my old space-ineptitude has returned. My recovery was an illusion. I am so ill with awkwardness that I can no longer fly. I must walk on the ground like one of the giant grubs. A curse on this planet Florida and all its sister orbs! What a miserable world this is!  How could I have been tricked by a young Gamma type of the walking grub? Let her crawl back under her ancestral rocks with all the rest of her kind.... No, no, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51774"],["title","The Weirdest World (#3)"],["body","do not mean that. To me she will always remain a dream, a broken dream.  I am no longer welcome at the Casino. They kicked me down the front steps.  I no longer have a home at the Reptile Ranch.  \"Mr. George Albert,\" said Eustace, \"I just can't afford to be seen with you any more. I have my position to consider, with a sports car and all that.\"  And Pete the python was curt.  \"Well, big shot, I guess you aren't so big after all. And you were sure no friend of mine. When you had that doctor cure me of my indigestion, you left me with nothing but my bad conscience. I wish I could get my indigestion back.\"  \"A curse on this world,\" I said.  \"World, world, water, water, glug, glug,\" said the turtles in their tanks, my only friends.  So I have gone back into the woods to die. I have located my ejection mortar, and when I know that death is finally on me, I will fire off my communication sphere and hope it will reach the galactic drift. Whoever finds it--friend--space traveler--you who were too impatient to remain on your own world--be you warned of this one! Here ingratitude is the rule and cruelty the main sport. The unfinished grubs have come out from under their rocks and they walk this world upside down with their heads in the air. Their friendship is fleeting, their promises are like the wind.  I am near my end."]]]
