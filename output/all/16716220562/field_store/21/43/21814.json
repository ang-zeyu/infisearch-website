And it was to end in loss and bitterness.\" The Martian looked even more closely at Sollenar. \"Of course, the device does not specify details. No one but the auditor can know what fearful thing inhabits his story, or precisely how the end of it would come. You would, I believe, be Rufus Sollenar? Burr spoke of you and made the noise of laughing.\"  Sollenar opened his mouth. But there was nothing to say.  \"You want such a device?\" the Martian asked. \"We've prepared several since Burr left. He spoke of machines that would manufacture them in astronomical numbers. We, of course, have done our best with our poor hands.\"  Sollenar said: \"I would like to look out your door.\"  \"Pleasure.\"  Sollenar opened the door slightly. Mr. Ermine stood in the cleared street, motionless as the shadow buildings behind him. He raised one hand in a gesture of unfelt greeting as he saw Sollenar, then put it back on the stock of his rifle. Sollenar closed the door, and turned to the Martian. \"How much currency do you want?\"  \"Oh, all you have with you. You people always have a good deal with you when you travel.\"  Sollenar plunged his hands into his pockets and pulled out his billfold, his change, his keys, his jeweled radio; whatever was there, he rummaged out onto the floor, listening to the sound of rolling coins.  \"I wish I had more here,\" he laughed. \"I wish I had the amount that man out there is going to recover when he shoots me.\"  The Martian engineer cocked his head. \"But your dream is over, Mr. Sollenar,\" he clacked drily. \"Isn't it?\"  \"Quite so. But you to your purposes and I to mine. Now give me one of those projectors. And set it to predispose a situation I am about to specify to you. Take however long it needs. The audience is a patient one.\" He laughed, and tears gathered in his eyes.         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Ermine waited, isolated from the cold, listening to hear whether the rifle stock was slipping out of his fingers. He had no desire to go into the Martian building after Sollenar and involve third parties. All he wanted was to put Sollenar's body under a dated marker, with as little trouble as possible.  Now and then he walked a few paces backward and forward, to keep from losing muscular control at his extremities because of low skin temperature. Sollenar must come out soon enough. He had no food supply with him, and though Ermine did not like the risk of engaging a man like Sollenar in a starvation contest, there was no doubt that a man with no taste for fuel could outlast one with the acquired reflexes of eating.  The door opened and Sollenar came out.  He was carrying something. Perhaps a weapon. Ermine let him come closer while he raised and carefully sighted his rifle. Sollenar might have some Martian weapon or he might not. Ermine did not particularly care. If Ermine died, he would hardly notice it--far less than he would notice a botched ending to a job of work already roiled by Sollenar's break away at the space field. If Ermine died, some other SPRO agent would be assigned almost immediately. No matter what happened, SPRO would stop Sollenar before he ever reached Abernathy Field.  So there was plenty of time to aim an unhurried, clean shot.  Sollenar was closer, now. He seemed to be in a very agitated frame of mind. He held out whatever he had in his hand.  It was another one of the Martian entertainment machines. Sollenar seemed to be offering it as a token to Ermine. Ermine smiled.  \"What can you offer me, Mr. Sollenar?\" he said, and shot.  The golden ball rolled away over the sand. \"There, now,\" Ermine said. \"_Now_, wouldn't you sooner be me than you? And where is the thing that made the difference between us?\"  He shivered. He was chilly. Sand was blowing against his tender face, which had been somewhat abraded during his long wait.  He stopped, transfixed.  He lifted his head.  Then, with a great swing of his arms, he sent the rifle whirling away. \"The wind!\" he sighed into the thin air. \"I feel the wind.\" He leapt into the air, and sand flew away from his feet as he landed. He whispered to himself: \"I feel the ground!\"  He stared in tremblant joy at Sollenar's empty body. \"What have you given me?\" Full of his own rebirth, he swung his head up at the sky again, and cried in the direction of the Sun: \"Oh, you squeezing, nibbling people who made me incorruptible and thought that was the end of me!\"  With love he buried Sollenar, and with reverence he put up the marker, but he had plans for what he might accomplish with the facts of this transaction, and the myriad others he was privy to.  A sharp bit of pottery had penetrated the sole of his shoe and gashed his foot, but he, not having seen it, hadn't felt it. Nor would he see it or feel it even when he changed his stockings; for he had not noticed the wound when it was made. It didn't matter. In a few days it would heal, though not as rapidly as if it had been properly attended to.  Vaguely, he heard the sound of Martians clacking behind their closed door as he hurried out of the city, full of revenge, and reverence for his savior."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51730"],["title","Life of David W.

TO THE MISSIONARIES  OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST  OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS, AT HOME AND ABROAD,  THIS FEEBLE SKETCH OF THE LIFE WORK OF ONE WHOSE  ENERGIES WERE ALL DEVOTED TO THE SAME  WORTHY PURPOSE AS THEIR OWN, IS  MOST RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED.    Preface.  The writing of this little volume has been a pleasant task. And just as we find mingled with our regret at parting with a friend, a joy in the assurance that to whomsoever he comes he will give the same pleasure he has afforded us, so the author has a feeling in putting out this brief memoir of David W. Patten that the courage and faith manifested in his life will not be lost or unfruitful in the lives of those who contemplate his career.  There remains only the pleasure of thanking those who have taken an interest in this work, and their name is legion. But first of all perhaps is the nephew of Apostle Patten, Thomas Jefferson Patten, of Provo, Utah.  Particular mention should be made of the kindness shown by the late President Wilford Woodruff, by President Lorenzo Snow, by President Joseph F. Smith, by the late Apostle Franklin D. Richards and by the late President Abraham O. Smoot, of Utah Stake. In short, all who knew, or who have read of, Apostle David W. Patten, have seemed to count it a pleasure to do whatever they could to assist in perpetuating his memory.  L.A.W.  Salt Lake City, Utah, February 8, 1900.    OFFICE OF  _The First Presidency_  OF THE  _Church of Jesus Christ_  OF  _Latter-day Saints._  P. O. Box B.  _Salt Lake City, Utah_, February 6, 1900.  _To the Reader:_  _All the circumstances of my first and last meeting with Apostle David W. Patten are as clear to my mind as if it were an occurrence of but yesterday, and yet it took place some sixty-four years ago. He appeared to me then to be a remarkable man, and that impression has remained with me ever since._  _We traveled together on horseback from my father's home, at Mantua, Ohio, to Kirtland, a distance of perhaps twenty-five miles, he on his return from some missionary labor, I to commence a course of studies at Oberlin College._  _On the way our conversation fell upon religion and philosophy, and being young and having enjoyed some scholastic advantages, I was at first disposed to treat his opinions lightly, especially so as they were not always clothed in grammatical language; but as he proceeded in his earnest and humble way to open up before my mind the plan of salvation, I seemed unable to resist the knowledge that he was a man of God and that his testimony was true. I felt pricked in my heart._  _This he evidently perceived, for almost the last thing he said to me, after bearing his testimony, was that I should go to the Lord before retiring at night and ask him for myself. This I did with the result that from the day I met this great Apostle, all my aspirations have been enlarged and heightened immeasurably. This was the turning point in my life._  _What impressed me most was his absolute sincerity, his earnestness and his spiritual power; and I believe I cannot do better in this connection than to commend a careful study of his life to the honest in heart everywhere._  _Lorenzo Snow_    CONTENTS.

LIFE  OF  DAVID W. PATTEN.  \"_God gives me all the power I have_.\"  DAVID W. PATTEN.  I.  Early life of David W. Patten--Parentage--Marriage--Joins the Methodists--Learns of the restoration of the Gospel--Visits his brother--Resume of Church history--Receives Baptism--First mission.  Great men are the Lord's object lessons to the world. They hold out to mankind the measure of truth committed to their generation. As example is greater than precept, so a life may state a truth more forcibly than words.  When He answered the question as to the first great commandment, the Savior did more than satisfy the idle curiosity of the listening crowd, he indicated one of the underlying purposes of this life and stated the principle by which the degree of civilization will be determined.  Measured by the love he bore his Maker and his fellow-men, few greater men have ever lived than David Wyman Patten. With all the intensity of his nature, he served the Lord, and with the same undivided purpose he was devoted to the welfare of humanity. Having in mind that divine precept, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend,\" the Prophet Joseph Smith said over the remains of this great Apostle, \"There lies a man who has done just as he said he would--he has laid down his life for his friends.\"  Of David's early life little is known. While he was quite young, his parents, Benenio Patten and Abagail Cole Patten, removed from the State of Vermont, where he was born about the year 1800, to the town of Theresa, at Indian River Falls, in the western part of the State of New York.  Leaving home while yet a boy, he made his way to the southeastern part of Michigan, and made himself a home in the woods a short distance above the little town of Dundee, in Monroe County, where he married Miss Phoebe Ann Babcock, in 1828. Here, too, though telling his fellow-religionists that there was no true religion on the earth, he allied himself with the Methodists.  Having been from youth of a religious turn of mind, he had received a particular manifestation of the Holy Ghost when he was twenty-one years of age. Being admonished to humble himself before the Lord and repent of his sins, he enjoyed for the next three years a close communion with the Lord, through visions and dreams of the night. In one of these it was made known to him that the Church of Christ would be established in his day, and he looked forward to such an event with joyous anticipation.  When about the age of twenty-four years, as he tells us in his meager journal, he became, through the cares of the world, neglectful in conduct, and remained so to some extent until he was thirty years old, when, by sincere repentance, he again received a testimony that his sins were forgiven. Under these conditions and at about this time he saw for the first time a copy of the Book of Mormon, but only long enough to read the inspired preface and the testimony of the eleven witnesses. From this time he prayed continually for faith and a more perfect knowledge. It was while living in anticipation of just such an event, therefore, that he received, in the latter part of May, 1832, a letter from his elder brother, John Patten, of Fairplay, Indiana, informing him of the restoration of the Gospel.  The message fairly caused his heart to leap for joy. He seemed conscious of the light which was about to burst upon him. He knew by intuition that his life's darkness was over, and that henceforward he should walk in the light of eternal truth. He arose in the meeting that day--for it was on a Sunday he received the intelligence--and told the assembly that he had at last got word of the Church of Christ.  Impatient to be off, he mounted his old grey mare the next morning and started alone through the woods on a journey of three hundred miles. That part of the country in those days was little more than a wilderness. The roads by which the settlers had come from their eastern homes ran, in the main, east and west, so that David's way to the south led him over hills, through valleys and across rivers by paths almost unknown to the white man; but nature was in her glory, the birds made melody the day through, and, more than all else, his own heart, swelling with gratitude, kept time to the music of the spheres, for God had again spoken from the heavens, the questionings of his soul since boyhood had been answered, and those paths, rough though they were, led to the realization of his highest hopes this side of eternity. That otherwise lonely journey was filled with peace and happiness unspeakable.  Arrived at the home of his brother, at Fairplay, he found him, before an infidel, now a devoted Christian and substantially as the history of the rise of the Church was related to him we shall repeat it here:  \"In a little town six hundred miles to the east, in the State of New York, a young man named Joseph Smith, while praying in the woods twelve years ago, received a"]]]
