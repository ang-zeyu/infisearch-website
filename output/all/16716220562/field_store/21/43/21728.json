I used to stay with the doctored alien, now Aedo, but we finally learned we could trust him to follow our orders--which were to stay inside, away from the others, since we didn't know how they would take him. So I got to walking along with Ellik.  As dusk lengthened, we could see the spark that was our ship in its orbit along the retreating horizon.  Ellik twisted back his head and the side of his mouth. \"Look at him up there--_look!_\"  The spark burned brighter and danced in another direction.  \"He's gone! He left us!\" Ellik said.  \"It's okay. He's still there. Just corrected the orbit a little, I guess.\"  \"No, no, no,\" Ellik said. \"He started to make another try. But he got afraid to try to go into hyperspace alone.\"  \"He was just correcting for orbital decay.\"  \"You don't understand, Johnny. He's a coward. That makes him dangerous. He's getting desperate. That desperation will burst the dam of his own weakness and wash away our hope, _our lives_.\"  His voice hushed. He stood staring starkly ahead, his palms outstretched at his sides.  \"Maybe he isn't _that_ cowardly,\" I said hopefully.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Finished,\" Ellik announced. He meant he had finished editing the tape showing the operation on the alien and his recovery from his blue disease, from being an Indigo to better than an Azure.  \"The transmitter is finished too,\" I said.  Ellik had suggested a way of switching the tape camera to a video converter for one of the audio communicators, and I had been able to do it easy. It took parts from both our communicators and translators too.  Ellik fitted the coiled snake of tape into place. \"This will be a great day for your people, Aedo. After our friend from heaven lands, we will be able to teach you a way to cure all of your sick, to make all the Indigos like you.\"  \"Like me? Make like me?\" Aedo said in the pidgin terrestrial that Mike Ellik had taught him.  \"Yes. We'll show them how we cured you and how all can be cured.\"  \"You make show fellow like me? Make tell make that fellow like fellow like me?\"  \"Everything's ready, Mike,\" I called.  \"That's right, Aedo,\" Mike said. \"You'll show your people the way to equality.\"  \"Make all fellow like this fellow?\" Aedo asked.  \"Shall I call in Lee?\" I asked Mike.  \"Yes, that's right, Aedo. Just right.\"  \"No,\" Aedo said.  The alien stomped the tape camera and the communicator to bits before I could get a hammerlock on him.  Ellik just stared at the complete wreck of our only means of communication with the spaceship.  \"I be much man now. I much smart. Much smart than Azure hicks and Indigo slobs. I much smart all. I much man! Not to be all same now. _No._\" The snarl hung on in Aedo's throat.  Ellik lifted his head and sort of smiled. But not quite.  \"Well,\" he said slowly and sadly, \"what could you expect in the way of gratitude from a dirty alien?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Azures did accept Aedo all right. They seem to think he must have come from some other tribe. They don't associate him with the Indigo that disappeared. No Indigo ever became an Azure before.  Of course, Azures sometimes become Indigos, we found out.  It seems there's a virus of what Ellik called pseudo-cyanosis in the air. The Azures have become a pretty resistant breed to it, while the Indigos are all easy victims. But once in a while an Azure will come down with it and turn Indigo.  Mike Ellik caught it too.  It happened pretty fast. By the time we realized what it was, he was already too stupid to finish the operation he started on himself. I had to sew him up, not very neatly.  Ellik is treated pretty much like the rest of the Indigos. So am I. He takes it all pretty calm. He can still talk a little Earth. Whenever anybody kicks him, Ellik just mutters something about, \"What can fellow expect bunch lousy creeps like those fellow?\"  I guess I'll get it too. I think I am getting it.  It won't be so bad for me. Just like maybe going around drunk all the time, not being able to think or coordinate very well.  It will be kind of bad being a member of an inferior race, but the thing I'll hate about it the most isn't that, or even leaving old Lee up there, circling around and waiting for our call forever.  No, the thing I hate is having it happen _now_, just when I'm beginning to _learn_ something.  I'm not dead sure I know just exactly what I learned, but I think maybe I do:  You get just what you damned well expected all along from a bunch of blue-blooded mongrels!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51508"],["title","The Chasers (#0)"],["body","CHASERS                           By DANIEL F. GALOUYE                         Illustrated by Harrington             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                     Galaxy Magazine February 1961.

But              was this one the gaudy, impossible exception?   As the dust drifted clear of the ship's landing skids, at least two things became obvious:  One--although they had missed the city (if that's what it was) by miles, they had nevertheless managed to slam down near one of the numerous rural estates.  Two--the landscape would be crawling with Zaortian Fuzzy Tails for a long while to come. They were still pouring out of hatches sprung open by the crunching impact.  Kent Cassidy untangled himself from the control column and plucked one of the Fuzzy Tails from his neck. The creature scampered around until it found the ruptured hatch, then scurried through to join the squealing zoological exodus.  \"There goes ten thousand credits' worth of cargo,\" groaned Gene Mason. His stout form was slumped in dejection before the view port.  Cassidy sniffed the refreshing air that was drifting into the ship. \"Any idea where we are?\"  \"After the directional stabilizer blew, we made three blind jumps, all in the direction of Galactic Center. We could be _anywhere_ between Zaort Seven and the Far Rim.\"  \"Hey, look,\" said Cassidy.  From the hatchway, the sumptuous estate sprawled nearby, its many gabled manor closed off behind a high wire fence. Cassidy squinted, but failed to recognize the bold, flowing architectural style.  A small, bent figure clung to the wire netting of the fence. He was shouting at the ship, but his excited words were no match for the decompression hisses of the auxiliary drive.  \"Humanoid?\" Mason suggested.  \"Human, I'd say.\" Cassidy gestured toward the gear locker. \"Better break out the translator.\"  In baggy trousers and sagging blouse, the man raced back and forth behind the fence--the picture of frustrated anger. However, large, doleful eyes, complemented by a bald head and huge, pendulous ear lobes, belied his furious actions.  Presently the squeals of the Fuzzy Tails trailed off in the distance and the auxiliary drive quieted with a final sigh. And now the native's shouts rang out distinct and loud:  \"Quick! From here get you! Shoo! Scram! Or out there I'll come and apart tear you!\"  \"It's English!\" Mason exclaimed.  \"Of a sort. Archaic, but understandable. And not at all friendly.\"  Mason scratched his blunt chin. \"Guess we're not too far off the beaten star paths, eh?\"  Cassidy could find no grounds for challenging this observation as they started down the ladder--not until he looked overhead and saw three suns shining in the same sky. As far as he knew, there were no settled trinary systems.  Beyond the fence the native, a wisp of a man was still fuming. \"The hell away from here get! You I'm warning--no closer come!\"  Mason displayed a half frown. \"He's sure a sour cuss.\"  \"You stay with the ship,\" said Cassidy. \"I'll see what's fouling his tubes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Before Cassidy reached the fence, his pet Fuzzy Tail came scampering from behind a bush. It clambered up his trousers and wrapped itself around his neck. This encouraged the speculation that perhaps the shipment of Tails could be bartered for repairs to the stabilizer--_if_ there was a local space technology, and _if_ they could corral the animals.  The native grew even more frenzied now as Cassidy drew up before him.  \"Trespasser! Back get! _My_ property this be! Scram! You I'll kill!\"  The Fuzzy Tail uncoiled itself from around Cassidy's neck. Perching on his shoulder, it fussed back at the native in chirping, excited tones. It not only acted at times as though it owned Cassidy, but it also exercised a personal responsibility for his welfare.  \"Quiet!\" Cassidy snapped out.  It caught both the Fuzzy Tail and the old man by surprise. The animal bounded for cover while the native rocked back on his heels.  \"Be you not just a--_little bit_ afraid?\" His eyebrows mounted the wrinkled expanse of his forehead.  The nearby hedge rustled and parted to let through a dark-haired girl whose tanned skin suggested accustomed exposure to the multiple sunlight. Wearing a belted tunic that lacked inches of reaching her knees, she confronted the old man calmly.  \"It's all about what, Papa?\" she asked, with a trace of an amused smile.  \"Trespassers! On _our_ property, Riva! The alarm sound! Scat! To the woods take! Or a dead duck you be!\"  \"Now, Papa,\" she chided. Then, through the fence, \"Him you musn't mind. It's only his duty he's attending to.\"  From the distance, Cassidy had suspected the man was of Terran descent. Now, with Riva in the picture, he was certain this world was stocked either by intent or accident with true humans.  \"We're from Terra,\" he said.  She frowned. \"Ter-ra?\"  \"Earth. The original world--\"  Incomprehension flooded her even features. But her confusion was only temporary. \"Let's play.\"  It seemed like an altogether acceptable suggestion, Cassidy thought, eying the attractive girl. But he went on, \"This is our ship and--\"  \"Ship?\" Then she chased away her puzzlement with a sudden smile. \"Some nice games I know.\"  There was no space technology on this planet, Cassidy decided. They'd be strictly on their own as far as repairing the directional stabilizer was concerned.  By this time Papa, his eyes focused afar, had exploded again. \"Charge!\" he roared. \"After him! Wa-hoo! Away don't let him get!\" He was gripping the fence and straining toward the field.  Cassidy turned and saw, in the distance, a skimmer vehicle floating along several feet off the ground. In full pursuit was a shouting youth who paused occasionally to seize a rock and hurl it at the craft.  The old man turned toward his daughter. \"A good chase that be. Bet he wins.\"  \"Not a chance.\" The girl frowned. \"That be Nedal. Not so swift is he. Loses interest too quick, he does.\"  She surveyed Cassidy. \"Be you a chaser?\"  \"No, but I could do with a couple of stiff shots.\"  This drew Papa's attention back to the matter at hand. \"Trespassers! The road hit! Scat! Some dust kick up!\"  \"Quiet!\" Cassidy shouted. \"Will you listen a minute? I--\"  Two loyal Fuzzy Tails came charging up to the fence and added their raucous chatter to Papa's screeching diatribe, which had continued unchecked despite Cassidy's loud, desperate plea.  In the next instant, though, it seemed that a dam had burst overhead. Materializing from nowhere, at least a ton of water poured down on the agile-tongued native, the two Fuzzy Tails, Riva and Cassidy himself, bringing an abrupt end to all the commotion.  The animals streaked for the safety of the bushes while Papa and the girl dived back through the hedge. Bedraggled, Cassidy headed for the ship, wondering what sort of meteorological quirk he had encountered.         *       *       *       *       *  \"No, sir,\" he said some time later as he attacked the directional selector with pliers and a screwdriver, \"I don't like the setup. I don't like it worth a damn.\"  Mason traced the power lead to the junction box beside the hatch. \"Maybe they aren't _all_ like that.\"  \"In this sort of place, chances are that the first people you run into are typical. I'm afraid--\"  \"Say!\" Mason interrupted, staring outside. \"Look at this!\"  Cassidy went over to the hatch and watched a dozen or so men sprinting across the field, their voices rising in excited waves. A lithe young woman was in full flight before them. But she was screaming in delight as she turned now and then to beckon them on. One overtook her and brought her down with a waist tackle. She rebounded to her feet, however, and took off again.  Two of the pursuers collided and sprawled on the ground. They sprang up and tore into each other. Unconcerned with the personal dispute, the chase struck off in a new direction, heading toward the ship as it paralleled one of the nearby fenced-in estates.  Behind the wire mesh, a burly young man came charging down the main steps of the manor and raced along with the others.  \"That be the way!\" he yelled encouragement. \"Her go get! It's gaining you are! Hurry!\"  He drew up in time to avoid crashing into the side fence, then stood there watching the chase recede in the distance.  Within a hundred feet of the ship, one of the men fell out of the group, panting. He squinted at the vessel, then crept forward, circling to the right. Within arm's reach, he walked back and forth alongside the hull, giving it a close inspection. Finally he paused and fumbled with his clothes.  Cassidy started. \"Look what he's doing!\"  \"Against the side of the ship, too!\" said Mason.  Hearing them, the native jerked his head up toward the hatch, then backed off for a better view.  \"Stinkers!\" he yelled, shaking his fist. \"Out here come and fight! Take you both on I can!\"  When they only gaped, he whirled and sped off to rejoin the chase.  \"You see?\" said Cassidy. \"Now what do you think?\"  \"I think we'd better get that directional stabilizer working.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It took more than an hour to locate the trouble. \"The rectifier circuit's shot,\" Cassidy said finally. \"But maybe we can patch it up. Some of the amplifiers I suppose we can do without. But a hyper-oscillator we've got to have.\"  \"Say, you're doing it too,\" said Mason.  \"What?\"  \"Talking like the natives.\"  Cassidy looked up. \"Guess it's something that grows on you. Well, what do we do now?\"  \"Maybe the natives can help us.\"  \"If they don't even know where they're from, they probably left their volts and amps behind too. But that's only an assumption.\"  \"In that case,\" Mason said with a sigh, \"there's only one thing left to do--take Riva up on her invitation to, ah, play.\"  \"Funny,\""]]]
