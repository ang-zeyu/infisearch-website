The next thing to be done, is to make one of the principal axes of the central ellipsoid coincide with the axle of the top.  To effect this, we must begin by spinning the top gently about its axle, steadying the upper part with the finger at first. If the axle is already a principal axis the top will continue to revolve about its axle when the finger is removed. If it is not, we observe that the top begins to spin about some other axis, and the axle moves away from the centre of motion and then back to it again, and so on, alternately widening its circles and contracting them.  It is impossible to observe this motion successfully, without the aid of the coloured disc placed near the upper end of the axis. This disc is divided into sectors, and strongly coloured, so that each sector may be recognised by its colour when in rapid motion. If the axis about which the top is really revolving, falls within this disc, its position may be ascertained by the colour of the spot at the centre of motion. If the central spot appears red, we know that the invariable axis at that instant passes through the red part of the disc.  In this way we can trace the motion of the invariable axis in the revolving body, and we find that the path which it describes upon the disc may be a circle, an ellipse, an hyperbola, or a straight line, according to the arrangement of the instrument.  In the case in which the invariable axis coincides at first with the axle of the top, and returns to it after separating from it for a time, its true path is a circle or an ellipse having the axle in its _circumference_. The true principal axis is at the centre of the closed curve. It must be made to coincide with the axle by adjusting the vertical screws $l$, $m$, $n$.  Suppose that the colour of the centre of motion, when farthest from the axle, indicated that the axis of rotation passed through the sector $L$, then the principal axis must also lie in that sector at half the distance from the axle.  If this principal axis be that of _greatest_ moment of inertia, we must _raise_ the screw $l$ in order to bring it nearer the axle $A$. If it be the axis of least moment we must _lower_ the screw $l$. In this way we may make the principal axis coincide with the axle. Let us suppose that the principal axis is that of greatest moment of inertia, and that we have made it coincide with the axle of the instrument. Let us also suppose that the moments of inertia about the other axes are equal, and very little less than that about the axle. Let the top be spun about the axle and then receive a disturbance which causes it to spin about some other axis. The instantaneous axis will not remain at rest either in space or in the body. In space it will describe a right cone, completing a revolution in somewhat less than the time of revolution of the top. In the body it will describe another cone of larger angle in a period which is longer as the difference of axes of the body is smaller. The invariable axis will be fixed in space, and describe a cone in the body.  The relation of the different motions may be understood from the following illustration. Take a hoop and make it revolve about a stick which remains at rest and touches the inside of the hoop. The section of the stick represents the path of the instantaneous axis in space, the hoop that of the same axis in the body, and the axis of the stick the invariable axis. The point of contact represents the pole of the instantaneous axis itself, travelling many times round the stick before it gets once round the hoop. It is easy to see that the direction in which the hoop moves round the stick, so that if the top be spinning in the direction $L$, $M$, $N$, the colours will appear in the same order.  By screwing the bob B up the axle, the difference of the axes of inertia may be diminished, and the time of a complete revolution of the invariable axis in the body increased. By observing the number of revolutions of the top in a complete cycle of colours of the invariable axis, we may determine the ratio of the moments of inertia.  By screwing the bob up farther, we may make the axle the principal axis of _least_ moment of inertia.  The motion of the instantaneous axis will then be that of the point of contact of the stick with the _outside_ of the hoop rolling on it. The order of colours will be $N$, $M$, $L$, if the top be spinning in the direction $L$, $M$, $N$, and the more the bob is screwed up, the more rapidly will the colours change, till it ceases to be possible to make the observations correctly.  In calculating the dimensions of the parts of the instrument, it is necessary to provide for the exhibition of the instrument with its axle either the greatest or the least axis of inertia. The dimensions and weights of the parts of the top which I have found most suitable, are given in a note at the end of this paper.  Now let us make the axes of inertia in the plane of the ring unequal. We may do this by screwing the balance screws $x$ and $x^1$ farther from the axle without altering the centre of gravity.  Let us suppose the bob $B$ screwed up so as to make the axle the axis of least inertia. Then the mean axis is parallel to $xx^1$, and the greatest is at right angles to $xx^1$ in the horizontal plane. The path of the invariable axis on the disc is no longer a circle but an ellipse, concentric with the disc, and having its major axis parallel to the mean axis $xx^1$.  The smaller the difference between the moment of inertia about the axle and about the mean axis, the more eccentric the ellipse will be; and if, by screwing the bob down, the axle be made the mean axis, the path of the invariable axis will be no longer a closed curve, but an hyperbola, so that it will depart altogether from the neighbourhood of the axle. When the top is in this condition it must be spun gently, for it is very difficult to manage it when its motion gets more and more eccentric.  When the bob is screwed still farther down, the axle becomes the axis of greatest inertia, and $xx^1$ the least. The major axis of the ellipse described by the invariable axis will now be perpendicular to $xx^1$, and the farther the bob is screwed down, the eccentricity of the ellipse will diminish, and the velocity with which it is described will increase.  I have now described all the phenomena presented by a body revolving freely on its centre of gravity. If we wish to trace the motion of the invariable axis by means of the coloured sectors, we must make its motion very slow compared with that of the top. It is necessary, therefore, to make the moments of inertia about the principal axes very nearly equal, and in this case a very small change in the position of any part of the top will greatly derange the _position_ of the principal axis. So that when the top is well adjusted, a single turn of one of the screws of the ring is sufficient to make the axle no longer a principal axis, and to set the true axis at a considerable inclination to the axle of the top.  All the adjustments must therefore be most carefully arranged, or we may have the whole apparatus deranged by some eccentricity of spinning. The method of making the principal axis coincide with the axle must be studied and practised, or the first attempt at spinning rapidly may end in the destruction of the top, if not the table on which it is spun.  On the Earth’s Motion   We must remember that these motions of a body about its centre of gravity, are _not_ illustrations of the theory of the precession of the Equinoxes. Precession can be illustrated by the apparatus, but we must arrange it so that the force of gravity acts the part of the attraction of the sun and moon in producing a force tending to alter the axis of rotation. This is easily done by bringing the centre of gravity of the whole a little below the point on which it spins. The theory of such motions is far more easily comprehended than that which we have been investigating.  But the earth is a body whose principal axes are unequal, and from the phenomena of precession we can determine the ratio of the polar and equatorial axes of the “central ellipsoid;” and supposing the earth to have been set in motion about any axis except the principal axis, or to have had its original axis disturbed in any way, its subsequent motion would be that of the top when the bob is a little below the critical position.  The axis of angular momentum would have an invariable position in space, and would travel with respect to the earth round the axis of figure with a velocity $\\displaystyle = \\omega\\frac{C - A}{A}$ where $\\omega$ is the sidereal angular velocity of the earth. The apparent pole of the earth would travel (with respect to the earth) from west to east round the true pole, completing its circuit in $\\displaystyle \\frac{A}{C - A}$ sidereal days, which appears to be about 325.6 solar days.  The instantaneous axis would revolve about this axis in space in about a day, and would always be in a plane with the true axis of the earth and the axis of angular momentum. The effect of such a motion on the apparent position of a star would be, that its zenith distance should be increased and diminished during a period of 325.6 days. This alteration of zenith distance is the same above and below the pole, so that the polar distance of the star is unaltered. In fact the method of finding the pole of the heavens by observations of stars, gives the pole of the _invariable axis_, which is altered only by external forces, such as those of the sun and moon.  There is therefore no change in the apparent polar distance of stars due to this cause. It is the latitude which varies. The magnitude of this variation cannot be determined by theory. The periodic time of the variation may be found approximately from the known"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5192"],["title","On a Dynamical Top, for exhibiting the phenomena of the motion of a system of (#3)"],["body","properties of the earth. The epoch of maximum latitude cannot be found except by observation, but it must be later in proportion to the east longitude of the observatory.  In order to determine the existence of such a variation of latitude, I have examined the observations of _Polaris_ with the Greenwich Transit Circle in the years 1851-2-3-4. The observations of the upper transit during each month were collected, and the mean of each month found. The same was done for the lower transits. The difference of zenith distance of upper and lower transit is twice the polar distance of Polaris, and half the sum gives the co-latitude of Greenwich.  In this way I found the apparent co-latitude of Greenwich for each month of the four years specified.  There appeared a very slight indication of a maximum belonging to the set of months,   March, 51. Feb. 52. Dec. 52. Nov. 53. Sept. 54.   This result, however, is to be regarded as very doubtful, as there did not appear to be evidence for any variation exceeding half a second of space, and more observations would be required to establish the existence of so small a variation at all.  I therefore conclude that the earth has been for a long time revolving about an axis very near to the axis of figure, if not coinciding with it. The cause of this near coincidence is either the original softness of the earth, or the present fluidity of its interior. The axes of the earth are so nearly equal, that a considerable elevation of a tract of country might produce a deviation of the principal axis within the limits of observation, and the only cause which would restore the uniform motion, would be the action of a fluid which would gradually diminish the oscillations of latitude. The permanence of latitude essentially depends on the inequality of the earth’s axes, for if they had been all equal, any alteration of the crust of the earth would have produced new principal axes, and the axis of rotation would travel about those axes, altering the latitudes of all places, and yet not in the least altering the position of the axis of rotation among the stars.  Perhaps by a more extensive search and analysis of the observations of different observatories, the nature of the periodic variation of latitude, if it exist, may be determined. I am not aware of any calculations having been made to prove its non-existence, although, on dynamical grounds, we have every reason to look for some very small variation having the periodic time of 325.6 days nearly, a period which is clearly distinguished from any other astronomical cycle, and therefore easily recognised.  Note: Dimensions and Weights of the parts of the Dynamical Top.   Part Weight lb. oz. I. Body of the top-- Mean diameter of ring, 4 inches. Section of ring, $\\frac{1}{3}$ inch square. The conical portion rises from the upper and inner edge of the ring, a height of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches from the base. The whole body of the top weighs 1 7 Each of the nine adjusting screws has its screw 1 inch long, and the screw and head together weigh 1 ounce. The whole weigh   9 II. Axle, &c.-- Length of axle 5 inches, of which $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch at the bottom is occupied by the steel point, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches are brass with a good screw turned on it, and the remaining inch is of steel, with a sharp point at the top. The whole weighs   $1\\frac{1}{2}$ The bob $B$ has a diameter of 1.4 inches, and a thickness of .4. It weighs   $2\\frac{3}{4}$ The nuts $b$ and $c$, for clamping the bob and the body of the top on the axle, each weigh $\\frac{1}{2}$ oz.   1 Weight of whole top 2 $5\\frac{1}{4}$   The best arrangement, for general observations, is to have the disc of card divided into four quadrants, coloured with vermilion, chrome yellow, emerald green, and ultramarine. These are bright colours, and, if the vermilion is good, they combine into a grayish tint when the rotation is about the axle, and burst into brilliant colours when the axis is disturbed. It is useful to have some concentric circles, drawn with ink, over the colours, and about 12 radii drawn in strong pencil lines. It is easy to distinguish the ink from the pencil lines, as they cross the invariable axis, by their want of lustre. In this way, the path of the invariable axis may be identified with great accuracy, and compared with theory.    * 7th May 1857.
