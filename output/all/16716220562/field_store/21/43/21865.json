Howard, what in the world are you up to? Do you know the Monmouth County police are looking for you? Said there was somebody missing. Want to talk to you.\" The little man shook his head angrily. \"Knew I shouldn't let you stay at my place. Your aunt warned me, too. Why do you make trouble for me?\"  \"Police?\" Mooney asked faintly.  \"At my age! Police coming to the house. Who was that fella who's missing, Howard? Where did he go? Why doesn't he go home? His wife's half crazy. He shouldn't worry her like that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mooney clutched his uncle's shoulder. \"Do the police know where I am? You didn't tell them?\"  \"Tell them? How could I tell them? Only I saw your picture while I was eating my sandwich, so I went to the hotel and--\"  \"Uncle Lester, listen. What did they come to see you for?\"  \"Because I was stupid enough to let you stay in my house, that's what for,\" Lester said bitterly. \"Two days ago. Knocking on my door, hardly eight o'clock in the morning. They said there's a man missing, driving a truck, found the truck empty. Man from the Coast Guard station knows him, saw him picking up a couple of hitchhikers at a bridge someplace, recognized one of the hitchhikers. Said the hitchhiker'd been staying at my house. That's you, Howard. Don't lie; he described you. Pudgy, kind of a squinty look in the eyes, dressed like a bum--oh, it was you, all right.\"  \"Wait a minute. Nobody knows you've come here, right? Not even Auntie?\"  \"No, course not. She didn't see the picture, so how would she know? Would've said something if she had. Now come on, Howard, we've got to go to the police and--\"  \"Uncle Lester!\"  The little man paused and looked at him suspiciously. But that was all right; Mooney began to feel confidence flow back into him. It wasn't all over yet, not by a long shot.  \"Uncle Lester,\" he said, his voice low-pitched and persuasive, \"I have to ask you a very important question. Think before you answer, please. This is the question: Have you ever belonged to any Communist organization?\"  The old man blinked. After a moment, he exploded. \"Now what are you up to, Howard? _You_ know I never--\"  \"Think, Uncle Lester! Please. Way back when you were a boy--anything like that?\"  \"Of course not!\"  \"You're sure? Because I'm warning you, Uncle Lester, you're going to have to take the strictest security check anybody ever took. You've stumbled onto something important. You'll have to prove you can be trusted or--well, I can't answer for the consequences. You see, this involves--\" he looked around him furtively--\"Schenectady Project.\"  \"Schenec--\"  \"Schenectady Project.\" Mooney nodded. \"You've heard of the atom bomb? Uncle Lester, this is bigger!\"  \"Bigger than the at--\"  \"Bigger. It's the _molecule_ bomb. There aren't seventy-five men in the country that know what that so-called driver in the truck was up to, and now you're one of them.\"  Mooney nodded soberly, feeling his power. The old man was hooked, tied and delivered. He could tell by the look in the eyes, by the quivering of the lips. Now was the time to slip the contract in his hand; or, in the present instance, to--  \"I'll tell you what to do,\" whispered Mooney. \"Here's my key. You go up to my room. Don't knock--we don't want to attract attention. Walk right in. You'll see a man there and he'll explain everything. Understand?\"  \"Why--why, sure, Howard. But why don't you come with me?\"  Mooney raised a hand warningly. \"You might be followed. I'll have to keep a lookout.\"  Five minutes later, when Mooney tapped on the door of the room--three taps, pause, three taps--and cautiously pushed it open, the pale blue mist was just disappearing. Harse was standing angrily in the center of the room with the jointed metal thing thrust out ominously before him.  And of Uncle Lester, there was no trace at all.   V  Time passed; and then time was all gone, and it was midnight, nearly the Nexus Point.  In front of the hotel, a drowsy cab-driver gave them an argument. \"The Public Liberry? Listen, the Liberry ain't open this time of night. I ought to--Oh, thanks. Hop in.\" He folded the five-dollar bill and put the cab in gear.  Harse said ominously: \"Liberry, Mooney? Why do you instruct him to take us to the Liberry?\"  Mooney whispered: \"There's a law against being in the Park at night. We'll have to sneak in. The Library's right across the street.\"  Harse stared, with his luminous pale eyes. But it was true; there was such a law, for the parks of the city lately had become fields of honor where rival gangs contended with bottle shards and zip guns, where a passerby was odds-on to be mugged.  \"High Command must know this,\" Harse grumbled. \"Must proceed, they say, to Nexus Point. But then one finds the aboriginals have made laws! Oh, I shall make a report!\"  \"_Sure_ you will,\" Mooney soothed; but in his heart, he was prepared to bet heavily against it.  Because he had a new strategy. Clearly he couldn't get the survival kit from Harse. He had tried that and there was no luck; his arm still tingled as the bellboy's had, from having seemingly absent-mindedly taken the handle to help Harse. But there was a way.  Get rid of this clown from the future, he thought contentedly; meet the Nexus Point instead of Harse and there was the future, ripe for the taking! He knew where the rescuers would be--and, above all, he knew how to talk. Every man has one talent and Mooney's was salesmanship.  All the years wasted on peddling dime-store schemes like frozen-food plans! But this was the big time at last, so maybe the years of seasoning were not wasted, after all.  \"That for you, Uncle Lester,\" he muttered. Harse looked up from his viewer angrily and Mooney cleared his throat. \"I said,\" he explained hastily, \"we're almost at the--the Nexus Point.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Snow was drifting down. The cab-driver glanced at the black, quiet library, shook his head and pulled away, leaving black, wet tracks in the thin snow.  The pale-eyed man looked about him irritably. \"You!\" he cried, waking Mooney from a dream of possessing the next ten years of stock-market reports. \"You! Where is this Vale of Cashmere?\"  \"Right this way, Harse, right this way,\" said Mooney placatingly.  There was a wide sort of traffic circle--Grand Army Plaza was the name of it--and there were a few cars going around it. But not many, and none of them looked like police cars. Mooney looked up and down the broad, quiet streets.  \"Across here,\" he ordered, and led the time traveler toward the edge of the park. \"We can't go in the main entrance. There might be cops.\"  \"Cops?\"  \"Policemen. Law-enforcement officers. We'll just walk down here a way and then hop over the wall. Trust me,\" said Mooney, in the voice that had put frozen-food lockers into so many suburban homes.  The look from those pale eyes was anything but a look of trust, but Harse didn't say anything. He stared about with an expression of detached horror, like an Alabama gentlewoman condemned to walk through Harlem.  \"Now!\" whispered Mooney urgently.  And over the wall they went.  They were in a thicket of shrubs and brush, snow-laden, the snow sifting down into Mooney's neck every time he touched a branch, which was always; he couldn't avoid it. They crossed a path and then a road--long, curving, broad, white, empty. Down a hill, onto another path. Mooney paused, glancing around.  \"You know where you are. Going?\"  \"I think so. I'm looking for cops.\" None in sight. Mooney frowned. What the devil did the police think they were up to? They passed laws; why weren't they around to enforce them?  Mooney had his landmarks well in mind. There was the Drive, and there was the fork he was supposed to be looking for. It wouldn't be hard to find the path to the Vale. The only thing was, it was kind of important to Mooney's hope of future prosperity that he find a policeman first. And time was running out.  He glanced at the luminous dial of his watch--self-winding, shockproof, non-magnetic; the man in the hotel's jewelry shop had assured him only yesterday that he could depend on its time-keeping as on the beating of his heart. It was nearly a quarter of one.  \"Come along, come along!\" grumbled Harse.  Mooney stalled: \"I--I think we'd better go along this way. It _ought_ to be down there--\"  He cursed himself. Why hadn't he gone in the main entrance, where there was sure to be a cop? Harse would never have known the difference. But there was the artist in him that wanted the thing done perfectly, and so he had held to the pretense of avoiding police, had skulked and hidden. And now--  \"Look!\" he whispered, pointing.  Harse spat soundlessly and turned his eyes where Mooney was pointing.  Yes. Under a distant light, a moving figure, swinging a nightstick.  Mooney took a deep breath and planted a hand between Harse's shoulder blades.  \"Run!\" he yelled at the top of his voice, and shoved. He sounded so real, he almost convinced himself. \"We'll have to split up--I'll meet you there. Now _run_!\"   VI  Oh, clever Mooney! He crouched under a snowy tree, watching the man from the future speed effortlessly away ... in the wrong direction.  The cop was hailing him; clever cop! All it had taken was a couple of full-throated yells and at once the cop had perceived that someone was in the park. But cleverer than any cop was Mooney.  Men from the future. Why, thought Mooney contentedly, no Mrs. Meyerhauser of the suburbs would have let me get away with a trick like that to sell her a freezer. There's going to be no problem at all. I don't have to worry about a thing. Mooney can take care of himself!  By then, he had caught his breath--and time was passing, passing.  He heard a distant confused yelling. Harse and the cop? But it didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was getting to the Nexus Point at one minute past one.  He took a deep"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51809"],["title","Survival Kit (#6)"],["body","and began to trot. Slipping in the snow, panting heavily, he went down the path, around the little glade, across the covered bridge.  He found the shallow steps that led down to the Vale.  And there it was below him: a broad space where walks joined, and in the space a thing shaped like a dinosaur egg, rounded and huge. It glowed with a silvery sheen.  Confidently, Mooney started down the steps toward the egg and the moving figures that flitted soundlessly around it. Harse was not the only time traveler, Mooney saw. Good, that might make it all the simpler. Should he change his plan and feign amnesia, pass himself off as one of their own men?  Or--  A movement made him look over his shoulder.  Somebody was standing at the top of the steps. \"Hell's fire,\" whispered Mooney. He'd forgotten all about that aboriginal law; and here above him stood a man in a policeman's uniform, staring down with pale eyes.  No, not a policeman. The face was--Harse's.  Mooney swallowed and stood rooted.  \"You!\" Harse's savage voice came growling. \"You are to stand. Still?\"  Mooney didn't need the order; he couldn't move. No twentieth-century cop was a match for Harse, that was clear; Harse had bested him, taken his uniform away from him for camouflage--and here he was.  Unfortunately, so was Howard Mooney.  The figures below were looking up, pointing and talking; Harse from above was coming down. Mooney could only stand, and wish--wish that he were back in Sea Bright, living on cookies and stale tea, wish he had planned things with more intelligence, more skill--perhaps even with more honesty. But it was too late for wishing.  Harse came down the steps, paused a yard from Mooney, scowled a withering scowl--and passed on.  He reached the bottom of the steps and joined the others waiting about the egg. They all went inside.  The glowing silvery colors winked and went out. The egg flamed purple, faded, turned transparent and disappeared.  Mooney stared and, yelling a demand for payment, ran stumbling down the steps to where it had been. There was a round thawed spot, a trampled patch--nothing else.  They were gone....  Almost gone. Because there was a sudden bright wash of flame from overhead--cold silvery flame. He looked up, dazzled. Over him, the egg was visible as thin smoke, hovering. A smoky, half-transparent hand reached out of a port. A thin, reedy voice cried: \"I promised you. Pay?\"  And the silvery dispatch-case sort of thing, the survival kit, dropped soundlessly to the snow beside Mooney.  When he looked up again, the egg was gone for good.         *       *       *       *       *  He was clear back to the hotel before he got a grip on himself--and then he was drunk with delight. Honest Harse! Splendidly trustable Harse! Why, all this time, Mooney had been so worried, had worked so hard--and the whole survival kit was his, after all!  He had touched it gingerly before picking it up but it didn't shock him; clearly the protective devices, whatever they were, were off.  He sweated over it for an hour and a half, looking for levers, buttons, a slit that he might pry wider with the blade of a knife. At last he kicked it and yelled, past endurance: \"Open up, damn you!\"  It opened wide on the floor before him.  \"Oh, bless your heart!\" cried Mooney, falling to his knees to drag out the string of wampum, the little mechanical mice, the viewing-machine sort of thing. Treasures like those were beyond price; each one might fetch a fortune, if only in the wondrous new inventions he could patent if he could discover just how they worked.  But where were they?  Gone! The wampum was gone. The goggles were gone. Everything was gone--the little flat canisters, the map instruments, everything but one thing.  There was, in a corner of the case, a squarish, sharp-edged thing that Mooney stared at blindly for a long moment before he recognized it. It was a part--only a part--of the jointed construction that Harse had used to rid himself of undesirables by bathing them in blue light.  What a filthy trick! Mooney all but sobbed to himself.  He picked up the squarish thing bitterly. Probably it wouldn't even work, he thought, the world a ruin around him. It wasn't even the whole complete weapon.  Still--  There was a grooved, saddle-shaped affair that was clearly a sort of trigger; it could move forward or it could move back. Mooney thought deeply for a while.  Then he sat up, held the thing carefully away from him with the pointed part toward the wall and pressed, ever so gently pressed forward on the saddle-shaped thumb-trigger.  The pale blue haze leaped out, swirled around and, not finding anything alive in its range, dwindled and died.         *       *       *       *       *  Aha, thought Mooney, not everything is lost yet! Surely a bright young man could find some use for a weapon like this which removed, if it did not kill, which prevented any nastiness about a corpse turning up, or a messy job of disposal.  Why not see what happened if the thumb-piece was moved backward?  Well, why not? Mooney held the thing away from him, hesitated, and slid it back.  There was a sudden shivering tingle in his thumb, in the gadget he was holding, running all up and down his arm. A violet haze, very unlike the blue one, licked soundlessly forth--not burning, but destroying as surely as flame ever destroyed; for where the haze touched the gadget itself, the kit, everything that had to do with the man from the future, it seared and shattered. The gadget fell into white crystalline powder in Mooney's hand and the case itself became a rectangular shape traced in white powder ridges on the rug.  Oh, no! thought Mooney, even before the haze had gone. It can't be!  The flame danced away like a cloud, spreading and rising. While Mooney stared, it faded away, but not without leaving something behind.  Mooney threw his taut body backward, almost under the bed. What he saw, he didn't believe; what he believed filled him with panic.  No wonder Harse had laughed so when Mooney asked if its victims were dead. For there they were, all of them. Like djinn out of a jar, human figures jelled and solidified where the cloud of violet flame had not at all diffidently rolled.  They were alive, as big as life, and beginning to move--and so many of them! Three--five--six:  The truck-driver, yes, and a man in long red flannel underwear who must have been the policeman, and Uncle Lester, and the bartender's brother, and the chambermaid, and a man Mooney didn't know.  They were there, all of them; and they came toward him, and oh! but they were angry!"]]]
