Then a drop of liquid--a brown liquid for this one, a red for that one, and so on--was added to each. While Jerry gazed at the scene, fighting the headache that began to grow with the brightness of the lights over the operating table, the medic captured each jar and gave it a sharp, practiced shake.  And then the whole picture was clear to Jerry.  \"Crystal-clear,\" he said, with bitter humor.  For that was the answer. The fur-faces were colloidal, the raccoon/pangolins were crystalloid. Whatever fluid lay within the bellies of the animals, it was a super-saturate, needing but the right chemical additive before coming out of its liquid state to form the right crystals.  In each jar, almost instantly after shaking, bright crystals had begun to form within the liquid. Within but a few moments, the jars were being uncapped and the medics, with neat little tongs, were lifting the crystals from the solutions and placing them within the abdominal cavity of their anesthetized patient. The flap was fastened down into place with a gadget that seemed to work on the principle of a soldering iron. As it slid along the angled edges of the incision the sides met and fused, leaving only a tiny ridge to attest to the fact of the operation.  One of the medics nodded to the bare-to-the-waist creature still standing by. The man shoved over a wheeled cart, slipped the patient onto it and wheeled him out of the room through an archway barely within Jerry's field of vision.  Jerry's main concern, however, was for the fate of the crystalloid creature, lying so still upon the table. One of the medics undid the straps across the body, lifted it by a hind leg and shoved it through a hinged metal flap against the wall, then stabbed a button....  A red flare went off beyond the still oscillating metal flap, and Jerry had all the information he needed. A nice little incinerator, for hollowed-out corpses.  \"I wonder,\" Jerry thought dismally, \"how long my forty minutes will take in _this_ Contact!\" His headache was growing worse, and it wasn't just from the lights.  At that moment, a sudden lurch sent him crashing against the wall of the cage. A clamor of alarm bells began throughout the vessel.  One of the medics yelled something, and threw a switch against the wall opposite that housing the anesthetizing machine. A panel slid away, revealing a large mosaic of close-packed little spheroids. As the medic twisted a dial at the base of this arrangement, some of the spheroids began to flicker whitely, while others remained dark.  Then Jerry recognized it for what it was. A form of television screen, composed of individual lights instead of phosphorescing dots activated by magnetically guided electrons from a cathode. The effect was the same.  A picture, sharply etched by the alternation and varying intensities of the bulbs, appeared on the mosaic-screen. Across the dream-like surging of the black-gray-and-white heavy seas in the foreground, Jerry made out an armada of strange-looking vessels coming across the ocean toward wherever the pickup camera lay. Unlike Earth-vessels, they tapered _inward_ as the sides of the vessels rose from the waters, then were abruptly truncated near what would have been a peak by a railinged area that was the deck.  \"Unless I'm much mistaken,\" thought Jerry, grimly, \"I am on a ship which--be it alone or one of many in a convoy--is about to be attacked by those vessels out there.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A second later he knew he was right.  From the approaching fleet there had come no sign of armament, no flash or flame or belch of smoke or blaze of ray, but the room he was in jolted violently, then canted crazily for a sick moment before righting itself. The alarm bells grew louder in their metallic clangor.  Footsteps pounded down the corridor. The bare-to-the-waist man or another like him--Jerry could not distinguish between the creatures--came into the room shouting something. The surgeons shouted back and then the man raced out again.  Another jolt made the room tremble, but this time it felt different, as though the room were built to take that sort of stress. Jerry recognized that his ship was in the process of firing back, with whatever strange weapons these fur-faces employed. Even as he reasoned this out, one of the enemy vessels on the screen shuddered, split into almost-matching halves and plunged beneath the waves amid much flame and confusion.  The medics were not watching. One of them had moved out of Jerry's view and now stepped back into it, carrying the wriggling form of one of the animals from the cages. As Jerry watched, the animal, its orange teeth snapping vainly at those hard black fingertips on the medic's white-furred hands, was lashed to the table in the gray-smeared spot where its predecessor had perished. Then the bare-chested man was coming back into the room, wheeling a man on a cart. This one was missing fur from an arm and part of the chest area. Jerry was able to confirm his earlier theory that the hollowness of the creatures was extended throughout the flexible green body-sheaths.  \"Sonics,\" thought Jerry, all at once. \"They're using sonic rays on each other. A good dose of heavy infravibration could _ruin_ a collodial creature! The loss of the fur through subsonic friction is only a side-effect. The main damage is the breakdown of those colloid organs when the beam focuses on a man.\"  That would explain the way the other ship had simply sundered. Artificially induced metal-fatigue, by the application of controlled vibration.  \"Damn,\" thought Jerry, \"this is _dangerous_!\"  Other alien vessels were visible now on that granulated \"screen,\" heading away from the camera. At least Jerry's ship was not alone in the face of that armada. His ship was one of at least a dozen--with more, possibly, outside the pickup range of the camera--involved on his side of the battle. Some of them shattered silently apart and boiled into the churning waters with a violence so great that Jerry could \"feel\" the sound with his eyes.  Apparently the medics, while anxious about the course of the fray, did not want their surgical endeavors bothered with the actual noise of the battle. Or perhaps the technology which had evolved this type of TV screen had never stumbled upon the familiar-to-Earth methods of transmitting sound by electromagnetic radiation.         *       *       *       *       *  \"How long can forty minutes _last_?\" Jerry wondered in growing concern. By his own time-sense, warped by the lifespan of his host, he felt he'd been present in that room well over an hour. And still he was captive to the environment of the scaly crystalloid raccoon/pangolin creature, and doubly imperiled of survival. Even if \"his\" side took the lead in the struggle, many fur-faces would need this treatment--which destroyed one of his species with each operation.  Jerry did not know whether or not the animals were chosen in any special order. But his mind told him that even were his host the last so chosen, his odds for survival were dwindling fast.  Assuming the wall against which his cage was stacked with the others were the same size as the wall opposite his cage--and symmetrical construction of rooms seemed a strong likelihood--then, judging by his cage-size, the maximum number of cages that could be so stacked was six high and four across, or twenty-four cages. Figuring one animal per cage, that left some twenty-one animals ahead of him.  Possibly--barely possibly--this tier of cages might _not_ be against a wall. It might be the forefront of hundreds of rows of similar stacked cages. But no medic hurrying to save a life would walk to Row #2 when Row #1 was still undepleted.  \"So if I just sit here,\" he thought, gloomily, \"I'm bound to end up alongside a fur-face on that table. My life gone so that his may survive. 'It is a far, far better thing I do' and so on, but I don't know as I'm ready to lay down my life for a fur-face without even being given the _choice_, damn it! Let's figure a way _out_ of this mess!\"  The ship went _whooomp_, suddenly. The room gave a crazy tilt again before--rather sluggishly, Jerry noted with alarm--righting itself. At the same moment the TV screen blanked out.  \"Well, there goes the camera,\" he thought, his insides feeling oddly cold and upset. \"That may mean that if I don't die on the operating table, I may well be forced to succumb to a watery grave. Damn! _When_ will those forty minutes be _up_?\"  He was jerked from his thoughts by the appearance of a huge white-furred hand fumbling with the catch on his cage.  Hard, pointed black fingertips reached in through the opened door for him. Jerry snapped and clacked his teeth upon them in vain, as he was carried toward the strap-sided concavity beside a new fur-scorched patient on the operating table.  \"Use your head!\" he screamed at himself. \"These fur-faces aren't expecting an _intelligent_ attack from a lab-animal! The other crystalloid creatures have the paltry instinctive self-preservation mechanism to bite at the objects gripping them, those impervious black fingertips. But you know better, right?\"  And with that thought, Jerry tilted his head just a bit further forward, and let his orange fangs crackle through the thin chitinous green \"flesh\" beneath the stiff white fur on the alien's wrist....         *       *       *       *       *  Yellow dispersion-medium spurted with a satisfactory gush from the scalloped gap in the alien's forearm.  Jerry landed nimbly on his hind feet on the metal floor as the shrieking medic dashed to a confrere for whatever first aid is given when a colloidal creature's liquid contents are spilling out.  While a minor part of his mind wondered idly if they'd employ a tourniquet or just a cork, the rest of his mind concentrated on directing those fore-paw-and-foot phalanges to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51822"],["title","Arcturus Times Three (#7)"],["body","him swiftly up the face of the stacked cages. There were twenty-four of them, all right, against the wall. He perched precariously on the top, in the cage-roof-to-ceiling space that was too small for another layer of the same.  As the fur-face medic fiddled around with the wrist of the man Jerry had bitten (it was the raccoon/pangolin medic, of course), the anesthetist dragged a small stool over to the base of the stacked cages and began climbing up after him.  \"Oh, hell,\" thought Jerry, cowering weakly against the wall. \"If I had a piece of chalk or a charcoal stick I could write something. Or draw a picture, maybe, on the ceiling. Then they'd know I was intelligent, and--They'd probably use me anyhow. The middle of a battle is no time for writing learned scientific papers about new zoological 'finds.'\"  Those black fingertips were coming for him, too carefully for a repeat wrist-crunching performance. If he were taken this time the bearer would handle with care.  Jerry skittered and scrabbled for the corner near the wall, hoping to engage the anesthetist in a game of you-climb-up-at-_this_-point-and-I-run-back-to-_that_-point. But the fur-face had too long a reach to make it practical. As Jerry cowered helplessly, those black fingertips gripped him about the throat with strangling force. It apparently made no difference if he died on the top of the cages or under the scalpel. He could only fend feebly with his paws at the creature as he was lifted down to the table and set into the concavity, dizzy and sick.  \"White lightning?\" he begged. \"Come on, white lightning! Please, test, be over. How long can forty minutes _last_?\"  Then the room gave a horrible shudder and all the lights went out.  Jerry, not yet strapped in place, heard the cries of the medics, and then the terrifying sound of rushing seas in the invisible corridor as the room canted swiftly onto its side. This time it did not right itself. A thick, falling-elevator feeling bunched up inside Jerry. He knew that the warship was plunging beneath the heaving surge outside.  He scrambled about on the floor--no, it was the wall now--almost brained by the crashing bulk of the operating table. He kept jumping futilely upward, hoping somehow to escape to the corridor and get outside the ship before all that water got inside this room.  Then icy tons of fluid crashed down upon him, flattening him against the wall beneath his feet. The cries of the medics were suddenly gurgles, then a brief, faintly heard sound of bubbling.  Jerry, trying to swim against the swirling pressures of the flood that now lifted him from against the wall and spun him end over end, could hold his breath no longer.  In despair, he felt his jaws widen and take in the chill liquid in which he was whirled.  It went in without gagging him, and did not come out. Not through his mouth, at any rate. It came out through long slots just in front of those auricular vents in his head.  Gills! Jerry was an amphibian.  Webbing, hitherto folded away, appeared on his feet. \"I'll be damned,\" he sighed, with weary relief.  Then he paddled determinedly about in the utter blackness until he found a cage lying on its side, the door sprung open. Jerry got inside, closed the door until it caught as well as its broken catch would allow and settled himself for a nice wait.  \"At least I won't have to worry about getting gobbled by a natural underwater enemy,\" he figured.  He had to wait another subjective hour before the silent flash of white lightning lifted him out of his third, and last, Contact on Arcturus Beta.   VII  \"All right, sir?\" asked Peters, removing the bulky helmet with care.  Jerry sat up and nodded, blinking his eyes as he adjusted to his body once more. He was hard-pressed not to start testing his own joints and lungs and limbs for knowledge, and had to forcibly remind himself that this frail shell was his \"normal\" body.  Now to await the technician's analysis of the data.  Jerry, waving off Peters' hand, outstretched in automatic offer of assistance, sat up wearily on the edge of the couch. After a deep breath he got to his feet. Within the ship, the data-analyzer clattered busily.  \"Some hot coffee, sir?\" asked Peters, helpfully.  Jerry was annoyed at the effort it cost him just to talk. \"That will go nicely, Captain,\" he managed.  The technician leaned out the airlock door, his homely face split in a grin. \"No problem with the aliens, sir,\" he said to Peters. \"Amiability indeterminate, but their basic weapon is infrasonics. They're built like hard bubbles, sure suckers for bayonets or bullets. I don't think, with sonic-shields, we'll have much trouble with them.\"  Peters, in the process of pouring Jerry's coffee, shrugged. \"Well, we're not here to _make_ trouble, either. The roborocket reported that the aliens live either at sea or at least always in coastal regions. They shouldn't object to our starting a settlement this far inland.\"  \"And,\" said Jerry, suddenly, as he took the coffee and sipped at the hot brown liquid, \"I suppose those worm-creatures and the horned lions are to be eliminated?\"  The technician dropped his eyes. \"We can't have new colonists getting pulled into those burrows, or impaled on those horns, sir.\" He handed the report, translated by the machine into readable English, to Peters. The pilot scanned the sheets, and nodded.  \"Seems easy enough,\" he said agreeably. \"Those jellyfish-things, and the flying apes are similar to species encountered before. They'll respond to simple gunfire. Removal of the worm-things will be automatic, once their source of sustenance is destroyed.\"  Jerry continued to sip his coffee and made no comment.  \"As for the lion-things,\" Peters continued, \"I doubt we'll have to attack them directly, since their digestive mechanism calls for sulphur from those pits. When we cap off the pits, or dry them up, to clear the air for the incoming colonial wave, that should starve them out within a week.\"  \"Less than that,\" Jerry remarked emotionlessly. \"Being hungry they'll eat, regardless. Then, unable to go on to the next step in the process--the ingestion of the sulphur--they'll die of food-poisoning. Simple, neat and efficient.\"  Peters smiled and gripped Jerry's hand with his own.  \"We have you to thank for the information, sir,\" he said, in obvious admiration. \"At least we know we won't have to fight the intelligent aliens. We'll have the central regions; they'll have the coasts and seas.\"  \"And--\" Jerry pointedly withdrew his strong fingers from the pilot's hand--\"what happens when Mankind decides to spread out? When the colony grows awhile, it's bound to want some of the coastal regions. Then what?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Peters looked uncomfortable, then said, \"I don't think that's likely to happen, sir. Not for some time, at any rate.\"  \"But it _will_ happen,\" said Jerry, somberly. \"It always happens. Earthmen meet new races, arbitrate a hit, sign pacts and move in. Then, when they're settled pretty well, they ask the other race to move out. It's almost a truism, Captain, that Earth can't comprehend anyone but an Earthman having any rights to survival.\"  The tight-lipped technician exchanged a look with Peters, then ducked back inside the ship. Adverse commentary about a Space Zoologist was dangerous. But no one had yet been broken in rank or discharged for a facial expression.  \"Well, sir, you're entitled to your opinion, of course,\" said Peters, wishing he had the moral courage to duck inside after the technician and avoid conversing with Norcriss. The job was done; why not forget it?  Jerry, sensing the other man's discomfort, dropped the topic, and contented himself with sitting there in the increasing darkness, sipping his coffee. After a minute or two, Peters gratefully mumbled his excuses and went into the ship.  Jerry sighed, finished his coffee, then began to walk toward the edge of the clearing, to watch the stars glow more brightly than they could in the interference of the ship's lights illuminating the camp.  When he reached the rim of the wooded area, he stopped, then lay on his back in the cool grass and watched the night sky, his thoughts rueful ones and his inner amusement ironic.  People always were puzzled about how a Space Zoologist could stand being a creature other than a human being. And Space Zoologists always were puzzled about how a human being could stand being part of that conquering race called man.  The twinkling stars distracted Jerry. Lying there watching them, he wondered to which of their planets he would be sent next, and to what dangers he might--in his new bodies--be subjected.  Neither he nor any of his fellow zoologists had any real apprehensions about death in an alien body. Fear of death, yes. That was normal enough, and inescapable in any creature. But he had no fear of perishing as a crawling thing, or multilegged thing, or soaring winged thing.  To Jerry Norcriss--indeed, to any Space Zoologist--to die like a man was a dubious honor at best."]]]
