Served him right for being so noble.\"  She stared at the ceiling--it was so old its very fabric was beginning to crack--and said nothing.  \"He didn't even realize what he had here--\" Lockard tapped his broad chest with complacence--\"until it was too late. Took it for granted. Sickened me to see him taking the body for granted when I couldn't take mine that way. People used to shrink from me. Girls....\"  She sat up. \"Give me a milgot, Gabe.\"  He lighted one and handed it to her. \"For Christ's sake, Helen, I gave him more than he had a right to expect. I was too god-damn noble myself. I was well-milled; I didn't have to leave half of my holdings in my own name--I could have transferred them all to his. If I had, then he wouldn't have had the folio to hound me all over this planet or to other planets, if I'd had the nerve to shut myself up on a spaceship, knowing he probably would be shut up on it with me.\" He smiled. \"Of course he won't hurt me; that's the one compensation. Damage me, and he damages himself.\"  \"But it's your life he saves, too,\" she reminded him.  \"My life wouldn't ever have been in danger if it hadn't been for this continual persecution--it's driving me out of this dimension! I planned to start a new life with this body,\" he pleaded, anxious for belief and, as a matter of fact, she believed him; almost everybody has good intentions and there was no reason to except even such a one as Gabriel Lockard, or whatever he was originally named.  \"It was my appearance that got me mixed up,\" he went on. \"Given half a chance I could have straightened out--gone to Proxima Centauri, maybe, and then out to one of the frontier planets. Made something of myself up there. But nobody ever gave me a chance. Now, as long as he follows me, there's nothing I can do except run and try to hide and know all the time I can't escape--I'm already in the trap.\"  \"What can he do if you stay and face him?\"  \"I don't know--that's the hell of it. But he's smart. Somehow he'll lure me into another game. I don't know how, but that must be what he has in mind. What else could it be?\"  \"What else indeed?\" Helen asked, smiling up at the ceiling.         *       *       *       *       *  The milgot vanished in his fingers and he took another. \"It'd take time for him to arrange any kind of private game set-up, though, and as long as I keep on the move, he won't be able to create anything. Unless he runs into a floating zarquil game.\" He smiled mirthlessly. \"And he couldn't. Too much machinery, I understand.... Lucky he doesn't seem to have connections, the way I have,\" Lockard boasted. \"I have connections all over the god-damn planet. Transferred them when I transferred my holdings.\"  She got up, seated herself on the vanity bench, and took up a brush, which she ran absently over the pale hair that shimmered down to her paler shoulders. \"So we keep running all over the planet.... What would you do if I left you, Gabriel?\"  \"Kill you,\" he said without hesitation. \"Slowly. Even if I have to put this precious hulk of mine in jeopardy. And you wouldn't like that. Neither would your boy friend.\"  \"Stop calling him my--\"  \"Wait a minute--maybe there is an escape hatch!\" His blue eyes sharpened unbecomingly. \"He can't kill me, but there's nothing to stop my killing him.\"  \"How about the police?\" She tried to speak calmly as she passed the brush up and down, sometimes not even touching her hair. \"The body you have won't be any good to you with them looking for it. And you're not a professional exterminator, Gabe--you wouldn't be able to get away with it.\"  \"I can hire somebody else to do the killing. Remember I still have plenty of foliage. Maybe I didn't leave him exactly half of my property, but, what the hell, I left him enough.\"  \"How will you recognize him?\" she asked, half-turning, fearfully. \"He'll have a new body, you know.\"  \"You'll recognize him, Helen--you said you could.\" At that moment she could have wrapped her own hair tightly around her white throat and strangled herself; she was so appalled by her own witless treachery.  He dragged her to her feet. \"Aah, moonbeam, you know I didn't mean to hurt you. It's just that this whole crazy pattern's driving me out of this world. Once I get rid of that life-form, you'll see, I'll be a different man.\"  As his arms tightened around her, she wondered what it would be like, a different man in the same body.   V  \"What makes you think _I_ would do a thing like that?\" the little lawyer asked apprehensively, not meeting the bland blue eyes of the man who faced him across the old-fashioned flat-top desk. It was an even more outmoded office than most, but that did not necessarily indicate a low professional status; lawyers were great ones for tradition expressed in terms of out-of-date furniture. As for the dust that lay all over despite the air-conditioning ... well, that was inescapable, for Earth was a dusty planet.  \"Oh, not you yourself personally, of course,\" Gabriel Lockard--as the false one will continue to be called, since the dutchman had another name at the moment--said. \"But you know how to put me in touch with someone who can.\"  \"Nonsense. I don't know who gave you such libelous information, sir, but I must ask you to leave my office before I call--\"  \"It was Pat Ortiz who gave me the information,\" Lockard said softly. \"He also told me a lot of other interesting things about you, Gorman.\"  Gorman paled. \"I'm a respectable attorney.\"  \"Maybe you are now; maybe not. This isn't the kind of town that breeds respectability. But you certainly weren't sunny side up when Ortiz knew you. And he knew you well.\"  The lawyer licked his lips. \"Give me a chance, will you?\"  Lockard flushed. \"Chance! Everybody rates a chance but me. Can't you see, I am giving you a chance. Get me somebody to follow my pattern, and I promise you Ortiz won't talk.\"  Gorman slipped the plastic shells from his face and rubbed the pale watery eyes underneath. \"But how can I get you a man to do ... the thing you want done? I have no connections like that.\"  \"I'm sure you can make the right connections. Take your time about it, though; I'm in no hurry. I'm planning to adhere to this locale for a while.\"  \"How about this man you want ... put out of the way?\" Gorman suggested hopefully. \"How can you be sure he won't leave?\"  Gabriel laughed. \"He'll stay as long as I do.\"  The little lawyer took a deep breath. \"Mr. Lockard, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I really cannot do anything for you.\"  Gabe rose. \"Okay,\" he said softly. \"If that's your pattern, I'll just put a call through to Ortiz.\" He turned to go.  \"Wait a minute!\" the lawyer cried.  Lockard stopped.  \"Well?\"  Gorman swallowed. \"Possibly I may be able to do something for you, after all.... I just happened to have heard Jed Carmody is in town.\"  Gabriel looked at him inquiringly.  \"Oh ... I thought you might have heard the name. He's a killer, I understand, a professional exterminator ... on the run right now. But this is his head-quarters--I'm told--and he probably would come here. And he might be short on folio. Naturally, I've never had any dealings with him myself.\"  \"Naturally,\" Gabe mocked.  \"But I'll see what I can do.\" Gorman's voice was pleading. \"You'll wait, Mr. Lockard, won't you? It may be a little while before I can find out where he is. This isn't--\" his voice thinned--\"at all my type of pattern, you know.\"  \"I'll wait ... a reasonable length of time.\"  The door closed behind him. Descending pneumo tubes hissed outside. The little lawyer rose and went to the window--a flat expanse of transparent plastic set immovably into the wall of the building, an old building, an old town, an old planet. As he watched the street below, a faint half-smile curved his almost feminine mouth. He went back to the desk and punched a code on the vidiphone.         *       *       *       *       *  Gabriel crossed the street to the little cafe with the gold letters FOR HUMANS ONLY embedded in the one-way glass front; this was a town that adhered rigidly to the ancient privileges of the indigenous species. He entered as the shrillness of a vidiphone bell cut through the babble inside without in any way checking it. After a moment, his eyes grew accustomed to the dimness and he could see his wife waiting at a table near the entrance, daintily peeling a tigi fruit.  \"Well,\" she asked as she put a plump pink section into her mouth, \"did you hire your killer?\"  \"Shhh, not so loud!\" He threw himself into the chair next to hers. \"Do you want me to get into trouble...? And I wouldn't put it past you,\" he continued without waiting for an answer. \"Remember, it's your boy friend's body that gets into trouble.\"  \"He's not my boy friend.\"  A waiter beckoned from the vidiphone booth to someone sitting in the dark shadows at the rear of the restaurant.  \"Where is he?\" Gabriel exclaimed suddenly. \"He must be here somewhere. Tell me which he is, Helen?\"  His hand gripped her arm cruelly, as he swung her around on her chair to face each part of the room. \"Is it that guy over there...? That one...? That one?\"  She could not repress a start of surprise as her eyes met those of the thin-featured young man entering the vidiphone booth. He returned her gaze with somber interest.  Gabe relaxed. \"So that's the one, eh? Not very formidable. Looks the way he always should have looked.\" He lit a milgot. \"I'll get Gorman to tip off the zarquil boys--only one game in this parish, I'm told--that that life-form's not to be allowed to play; I'll make any loss good out of my own pocket. That'll keep him onstage for the nonce. He won't leave to get himself fixed up somewhere else as long as I stay. And I'm going to stay ... to the bitter end.\" He smiled lovingly to himself.  _But it's not the right man_, Helen thought gladly. _He did manage to change, after all. Gabe has the wrong man._ She felt a little sorry for the unknown and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50988"],["title","Bodyguard (#4)"],["body","individual who inhabited the delicate, angular body, but it was so close to death anyhow that the immediate threat didn't matter. And Gabriel--the real Gabriel--was safe.   VI  The emaciated young man entered Gorman's office and locked the door behind him with an electroseal. \"Disembodiment,\" he identified himself.  \"So you did get a new body, Jed,\" the lawyer remarked affably. \"Very good packaging. Makes you look like a poet or something.\"  \"Good as a disguise, maybe, but one hell of a lousy hulk.\" The young man hurled himself into the chair by the desk. Even Gorman winced at the cruel treatment accorded such obvious fragility. \"Gimme a milgot, Les. This thing--\" he indicated his body with contempt--\"is shot to Polaris. Won't last more than a few months. Some bargain I got.\"  Gorman lit a stick himself. \"The guy who got your body didn't get such a bargain either,\" he murmured through a cloud of purple smoke.  \"At least he'll live. If he's lucky. I wish he'd hurry and get himself picked up, though, so I could collect the folio and jet off. Can't go after it now. Hounds will be sniffing after anybody gravitating around the place where I've stashed it until they're sure they have me. They don't know where the money is exactly, of course, or they'd soak it up, but they've got an idea of the general sector.\"  \"Want me to pick it up for you, Jed?\" the lawyer asked, his pale, flickering eyes brushing across the young man's dark intense ones.  \"Oh, sure. All I need is for you to know where it is and all I'd see would be your rocket trail.\" The young man leaned across the expanse of littered steel. \"Or _do_ you know where it is, Les?\" he asked softly. \"Do you know where it is and are you just hibernating until I'm safely out of the way?\"  In spite of himself, Gorman could not help moving back. \"Don't be a fool, Jed,\" he said in a voice that was several tones higher. \"If I knew where it was ... well, you're not very frightening in your present embodiment, you know.\"  \"Don't be too sure of that, Gorman. And you were always yellow; anybody could frighten you.\" He began to laugh shrilly. \"Hey, that's good. Get it? Any body, see?\"  The lawyer did not join in the mirth. \"How are you fixed for cash?\" he asked abruptly.         *       *       *       *       *  The young man's face split in a sardonic grin. \"Why do you think I risked public communion with a darkside character like you, Les? I shot my wad making the shift. I could use a little loan. You know I have millions stashed away,\" the young man said angrily as Gorman remained silent. \"I'll pay you as soon as the hounds take the chump who's leasing my hulk.\"  \"Maybe you can earn some money.\" Gorman toyed with a paperweight. \"Did you get a look at that big blond guy in the cafe--the one I told you about on the phone?\"  \"Yeah. Nice life-form he had with him. I wouldn't mind being in that body.\"  \"Seems he wants somebody exterminated. And I told him I heard Jed Carmody was in the parish and might be interested.\"  The young man sprang to his feet, furious. \"You _what_?\"  \"Turn your antigravs off. I told him Jed Carmody was in the parish. Are you Jed Carmody?\"  The other sat down and exhaled heavily. \"You're on course--I'm nobody just now.\"  \"Any identification come with the package?\"  \"Naah, what'd you expect...? But why tell anyone that Jed Carmody's hitting the locality?\"  \"I thought you might be interested in picking up a little free-falling foliage.\"  The young man shook his head impatiently. \"Risk having this hulk heated up for a half-credit crime? Don't be an alien, Gorman. I'm going to hit subsoil until this other life-form gets collected by the hounds.\"  \"Thought you might like to do it to help me out,\" Gorman murmured.  The other man stared. \"How do you fit into the pattern?\" Gorman shrugged. \"Oh, I get it: this guy's putting the barometer on you?\"  Gorman nodded.  \"Bad landing, counselor. But you don't seriously expect...? Hey!\" The wide-set eyes glistened darkly. \"I got it! Why don't you get this guy who's got my hulk to make the flight? Send somebody out to magnetize him like you thought he was the real Carmody, see?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gorman looked hopeful for a moment; then shook his thin-haired head. \"No reason to think the man is an extralegal.\"  \"Anyone who finds himself in my hulk damn well has to be if he wants to stay out of the sardine box.... Look, what's the first thing he's going to want to do when he finds out what he's been stuck with? Go to another parish and hop hulks, right? And he'll need plenty of foliage to do it.\"  \"Maybe he has money,\" Gorman suggested wearily.  \"No fuel lost finding out.\" The young man rubbed his hands together gleefully. \"If he takes on the flight, though, see that he gets my flash, huh? Rosy up the picture.\"  \"Maybe he can kill whoever this Lockard has in mind without getting picked up by the police. Such things have happened; otherwise you wouldn't have been able to run around loose so long, Jed.\"  \"An amateur? Not a chance! Besides, just to make sure, little....\" He stopped in the act of tapping his chest. \"Say, I don't have a name, do I? What's a good epithet for me, Les? Something with class.\"  The lawyer studied the pale, bony face for a moment or two. \"How about John Keats?\" he suggested. \"Simple and appropriate.\"  The other man thought. \"Yeah, I like that. John Keats. Plain, but not like John Smith. Subtle. I'll buy it. Okay, so you think I'm going to take my view-finder off the fake Carmody? I'm going to adhere to that life-form closer than Mary's lamb. So when he knocks off whoever the other guy wants novaed, I can yell doggie. Then the hounds get him--with my flash on him and all, they'll never have the nebula of a notion that they don't have all of me.... I pick up the foliage and rock out to some place where I can buy me a new jewel case, no questions asked. Don't fret, Gorman--you'll get your nibble. I've never played the game with you, have I?\"  Instead of answering, Gorman asked a question of his own. \"Kind of hard on the other guy, isn't it?\"  \"He rates it for sticking me with a piece of statuary like this. Look at it this way, Les--in his own hulk he would've died; this way he's got a chance to live. Yeah, get him to make the flight, Les. You can charm the juice out of a lemon when you want to; it's your line of evil. And don't let on you know he's not the genuine article.\"  \"I won't,\" Gorman sighed. \"I only hope I can persuade him to take on the flight. Don't forget it's important to me too, Jed--uh, John.\"  \"Make planetfall, then,\" John Keats said. \"So long, Les.\"  \"Good-by, Johnny.\"   VII  Helen was brushing her long creamy hair at the dressing table when there came a tap at the door to the living room of the suite--a tap so light that it could have been someone accidentally brushing past in the corridor outside. Gabriel sprang up from the bed where he had been lolling, watching her and stood for a moment poised on the balls of his feet, until the knock was repeated more emphatically. He started toward the other room.  \"But who could be knocking at the door at this hour?\" she asked. \"It's almost one.... Gabe, do be careful.\"  He halted and looked back at her suspiciously. \"Why do you say that? You know you don't care what happens to me?\" That last was a question rather than a statement and had a plaintive quaver which failed to touch her. Once she had still been able to feel some compassion; now, nothing he said or did could arouse more than fear and disgust.  \"If somebody knocks you over the head when you open the door,\" she murmured, smiling at her own image, \"then who will be there to protect me?\"  A choked sound came from the back of the man's throat. He turned toward her, his fists clenched. She braced herself for the blow, but then the knock came for the third time and her husband reluctantly continued on into the living room, letting the door shut behind him. She rose and pushed it open a little. She had a pretty good idea of who might be expected, but was not especially perturbed, for she knew the real Gabriel Lockard, in whatever guise he might be now, was safe from her husband. And she was curious to see what the exterminator looked like.  The door to the corridor was out of her line of vision, but she could hear it as it opened. \"Lockard?\" a deep, husky voice whispered. \"Gorman sent me.\"  \"Come in, Mr. Carmody. You _are_ Carmody?\"  \"Shhh,\" the husky voice warned. \"If you get me into trouble, I'm not going to be able to complete your pattern for you, am I?\"  \"Sorry--I wasn't thinking. Come on in.\"  A heavy tread shook the ancient floorboards, and presently the man responsible for it came into the girl's sight. He was a huge creature, bigger even than Gabriel, with dark hair growing low to a point on his forehead, and a full-lipped sensual face. Then, as he spoke, as he moved, she knew who he was. She pressed close against the wall of the bedroom, her slender shoulders shaking, her handkerchief stuffed into her mouth, so that the sound of her wild, irrepressible laughter would not reach her husband's ears.  \"Sit down, Carmody,\" Gabriel said cordially, as he handed the newcomer a glass, \"and make yourself comfortable.\" There was a brief, rather awkward silence. \"Well,\" Gabriel went on, with a smile that would have been thoroughly ingratiating to anyone who hadn't known him, \"I don't suppose I have to cruise around the asteroids with you?\"  \"No,\" Carmody replied, looking speculatively toward the bedroom door. \"No, you don't.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gabriel followed the direction of his gaze. \"Worried about somebody overhearing? There's only my wife in there. She's listening, all right, but she won't talk. Come in, Helen.\"  Carmody rose automatically as she came in, his dark eyes following every line of her long, smooth body in its close-fitting, though opaque, negligee of smoke-gray silk--a fabric which, through extreme scarcity, had come"]]]
