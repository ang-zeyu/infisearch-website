I need to stop being a master and start being a man again.\"  Albin sighed. \"Slavery,\" he said. \"You think of slavery and it all rises up in front of you--Greece, India, China, Rome, England, the United States--all the past before the Confederation, all the different slaves.\" He grinned again. \"You think it's terrible, don't you?\"  \"It is terrible,\" Dodd said. \"It's--they're people, just like us. They have a right to their own lives.\"  \"Sure they do,\" Albin said. \"They have the right to--oh, to starve and die in that forest out there, for instance. And work out a lot of primitive rituals, and go through all the Stone Age motions for thousands of years until they develop civilization like you and me. Instead of being kept nice and warm and comfortable and taken care of, and taught things, by the evil old bastards like--well, like you and me again. Right?\"  \"They have rights,\" Dodd said stubbornly. \"They have rights of their own.\"  \"Sure they do,\" Albin agreed with great cheerfulness. \"How'd you like it if they got some of them? Dodd, maybe you'd like to see them starve? Because it's going to be a long, long time before they develop anything like a solid civilization, kiddo. And in the meantime a lot of them are going to die of things we can prevent. Right? And how'd you like that, Dodd? How would you like that?\"  Dodd hesitated. \"We ought to help them,\" he muttered.  \"Well,\" Albin said cheerfully, \"that's what we are doing. Keeping them alive, for instance. And teaching them.\"  \"Teaching,\" Dodd said. Again his voice had the faintly mocking sound of an echo. \"And what are we teaching them? Push this button for us. Watch this process for us. If anything changes push this button. Dig here. Carry there.\" He paused. \"Wonderful--for us. But what good does it do them?\"  \"We've got to live, too,\" Albin said.  Dodd stared. \"At their expense?\"  \"It's a living,\" Albin said casually, shrugging. Then: \"But I'm serious. One good dose of real enjoyment will cure you, friend. One good dose of fun--by which, kiddo, I mean plain ordinary old sex, such as can be had any free evening around here--and you'll stop being depressed and worried. Uncle Albin Cendar's Priceless Old Recipe, kiddo, and don't argue with me: it works.\"  Dodd said nothing at all. After a few seconds his eyes slowly closed and he sat like a statue in the room.  Albin, watching him, whistled inaudibly under his breath. A minute went by silently. The light in the room began to diminish.  \"Sun's going down,\" Albin offered.  There was no response. Albin got up again and went to the window.  \"Maybe you're right,\" he said with his back to Dodd's still figure. \"There ought to be some way of getting people off-planet, people who just don't want to stay here.\"  \"Do you know why there isn't?\" Dodd's voice was a shock, stronger than before.  \"Sure I know,\" Albin said. \"There's--\"  \"Slavery,\" Dodd said. \"Oh, sure, maybe somebody knows about it, but it's got to be kept quiet. And if anybody got back--well, look.\"  \"Don't bother me with it.\" Albin's voice was suddenly less sure.  \"Look,\" Dodd said. \"The Confederation needs the metal. It exists pure here, and in quantity. But if they knew, really knew, how we mined and smelted and purified it and got it ready for shipment....\"  \"So suppose somebody goes back,\" Albin said. \"Suppose somebody talks. What difference does it make? It's just rumor, nothing official. No, the reason nobody goes back is cargo space, pure and simple. We need every inch of cargo space for the shipments.\"  \"If somebody goes back,\" Dodd said, \"the people will know. Not the government, not the businesses, the people. And the people don't like slavery, Albin. No matter how necessary a government finds it. No matter what kind of a jerry-built defense you can put up for it.\"  \"Don't be silly,\" Albin said. There was less conviction in his voice; he looked out at the sunset as if he were trying to reassure himself.  \"Nobody's allowed to leave,\" Dodd said, more quietly. \"We're--they're taking every precaution they can. But some day--maybe some day, Albin--the people are going to find out in spite of every precaution.\" He sat straighter. \"And then it'll all be over. Then they'll be wiped out, Albin. Wiped out.\"  \"They need us,\" Albin said uncertainly. \"They can't do without us.\"  Dodd swung round to face him. The sunset was a deepening blaze in the Commons Room. \"Wait and find out,\" he said in a voice that suddenly rang on the metal walls. \"Wait and find out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After a long time Albin said. \"Damn it, what you need is education. A cure. Fun. What I've been saying.\" He paused and took a breath. \"How about it, Dodd?\"  Dodd didn't move. Another second passed. \"All right, Albin,\" he said slowly, at last. \"I'll think about it. I'll think about it.\"     3   The sleeping room for the Small Ones was, by comparison with the great Commons Room only the masters inhabited, a tiny place. It had only the smallest of windows, so placed as to allow daylight without any sight of the outside; the windows were plastic-sheeted slits high up on the metal walls, no more. The room was, at best, dim, during the day, but that hardly mattered: during the day the room was empty. Only at night, when the soft artificial lights went on, shedding the glow from their wall-shielded tubes, was the room fit for normal vision. There were no decorations, of course, and no chairs: the Alberts had no use for chairs, and decorations were a refinement no master had yet bothered to think of. The Alberts were hardly taught to appreciate such things in any case: that was not what they had come to learn: it was not useful.  The floor of the room was covered with soft leaves striped a glossy brown over the pervasive gray-green of the planet's foliage. These served as a soft mat for sleeping, and were also the staple food of the Alberts. These were not disturbed to find their food strewn in such irregular heaps and drifts across the metal floor: in their birth sacs, they had lived by ingestion from the floor of the forest, and, later, they had been so fed in the Birth Huts to which the Elders had taken them, and where they had been cleaned and served and taught, among other matters, English.  What they had been taught was, at any rate, English of a sort, bearing within it the seeds of a more complex tongue, and having its roots far back in the pre-space centuries, when missionaries had first begun to visit strange lands. Men had called it pidgin and Beche-le-mer and a hundred different names in a hundred different variations. Here, the masters called it English. The Alberts called it words, and nothing more.  Now, after sunset, they filed in, thirty or so jewel-green cyclopean alligators at the end of their first day of training, waddling clumsily past the doorway and settled with a grateful, crouching squat on the leaves that served as bed and food. None were bothered by the act of sitting on the leaves: for one thing, they had no concept of dirt. In the second place, they were rather remarkably clean. They had neither sex organs, in any human sense of the word, or specific organs of evacuation: their entire elimination was gaseous. Air ducts in the room would draw off the waste products, and the Alberts never noticed them: they had, in fact, no conception of evacuation as a process, since to them the entire procedure was invisible and impalpable.  The last of them filed in, and the masters--two of them, carrying long metal tubes--shut the door. The Alberts were alone. The door's clang was followed by other sounds as the lock was thrown. The new noises, and the strangeness of bare metal walls and artificial light, still novel after only a single day's training, gave rise to something very like a panic, and a confused babble of voices arose from the crowd.  \"What is this?\"  \"What place is this?\"  \"It is a training place.\"  \"My name Hortat. My name Hortat.\"  \"What is training?\"  \"There is food here.\"  \"What place is this?\"  \"Where are elders?\"  \"Are masters here?\"  \"My food.\"  \"Is this a place for sleeping?\"  \"Training is to do what a master says. Training--\"  \"There are no elders. My name Hortat.\"  \"My place.\"  \"My food.\"  \"Where is this?\"  \"Where is this place?\"  Like the stirring of a child in sleep, the panic lasted only a little while, and gave way to an apathetic peace. Here and there an Albert munched on a leaf, holding it up before his wide mouth in the pose of a giant squirrel. Others sat quietly looking at the walls or the door or the window, or at nothing. One, whose name was Cadnan, stirred briefly and dropped the leaf he was eating and turned to the Albert next to him.  \"Marvor,\" he said. \"Are you troubled?\"  Marvor seemed slighter than Cadnan, and his single eye larger, but both looked very much alike to humans, as members of other races, and particularly such races as the human in question judges inferior, are prone to do. \"I do not know what happens,\" he said in a flat tone. \"I do not know what is this place, or what we do.\"  \"This is the place of masters,\" Cadnan said. \"We train here, and we work here, and live here. It is the rule of the masters.\"  \"Yet I do not know,\" Marvor said. \"This training is a hard thing, and the work is also hard when it comes.\"  Cadnan closed his eye for a second, to relax, but he found he wanted to talk. His first day in the world of the masters had been too confusing for him to order it into any sensible structure. Conversation, of whatever kind, was a release, and might provide more facts. Cadnan was hungry for facts.  He opened his eye again.  \"It is what the masters say,\" he told Marvor. \"The masters say we do a thing, and we do it. This is right.\"  Marvor bent toward him. \"Why is it right?\" he asked.  \"Because the masters say it is right,\" Cadnan told him, with the surprised air of a person explaining the obvious. \"The elders, too, say it before we come to this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51855"],["title","Slave Planet (#3)"],["body","e.\" He added the final sentence like a totally unnecessary clincher--unimportant by comparison with the first reason, but adding a little weight of its own, and making the whole story even more satisfying.  Marvor, however, didn't seem satisfied. \"The masters always speak truth,\" he said. \"Is this what you tell me?\"  \"It is true,\" Cadnan said flatly.  Marvor reflected for a second. \"It may be,\" he said at last. He turned away, found a leaf and began to munch on it slowly. Cadnan picked up his own leaf quite automatically, and it was several seconds before he realized that Marvor had ended the conversation. He didn't want it to end. Talk, he told himself dimly, was a good thing.  \"Marvor,\" he said, \"do you question the masters?\" It was a difficult sentence to frame: the idea itself would never have occurred to him without Marvor's prodding, and it seemed now no more than the wildest possible flight of fancy. But Marvor, turning, did not treat it fancifully at all.  \"I question all,\" he said soberly. \"It is good to question all.\"  \"But the masters--\" Cadnan said.  Marvor turned away again without answering.  Cadnan stared at his leaf for a time. His mind was troubled, and there were no ready solutions in it. He was not of the temperament to fasten himself to easy solutions. He had instead to hammer out his ideas slowly and carefully: then when he had reached a conclusion of some kind, he had confidence in it and knew it would last.  Marvor was just the same--but perhaps there had been something wrong with him from the beginning. Otherwise, Cadnan realized, he would never have questioned the masters. None of the Alberts questioned the masters, any more than they questioned their food or the air they breathed.  After a time Marvor spoke again. \"I am different,\" he said, \"I am not like others.\"  Cadnan thought this too obvious to be worth reply, and waited.  \"The elders tell me in the hut I am different,\" Marvor went on. \"When they come to bring food they tell me this.\"  Cadnan took a deep breath of the air. It was, of course, scented with the musk of the Alberts, but Cadnan could not recognize it: like his fellows, he had no sense of smell. \"Different is not good,\" he said, perceiving a lesson.  \"You find out how different I am.\" Marvor sat very still. His voice was still flat but the tone carried something very like a threat. Cadnan, involved in his own thinking, ignored it.  \"The masters are big and we are small,\" he said slowly. \"The masters know better than we know.\"  \"That is silliness,\" Marvor said instantly. \"I want things. They make me do training. Why can I not do what I want to do?\"  \"Maybe,\" Cadnan said with care, \"it is bad.\"  Marvor made a hissing sound. \"Maybe they are bad,\" he said. \"Maybe the masters and the elders are bad.\"  Matters had gone so far that even this thought found a tentative lodgment in Cadnan's mind. But, almost at once, it was rejected as a serious concept. \"They give us leaves to eat,\" he said. \"They keep us here, warm and dry in this place. How is this bad?\"  Marvor closed his eye and made the hissing sound again; it was equivalent to a laugh of rejection. He turned among the leaves and found enough room to lie down: in a few seconds he was either asleep or imitating sleep very well. Cadnan looked at him hopefully, and then turned away. A female was watching him from the other side, her eyes wide and unblinking.  \"You ask many questions,\" the female said. \"You speak much.\"  Cadnan blinked his eye at her. \"I want to learn,\" he said.  \"Is it good to learn?\" the female asked. The question made Cadnan uncomfortable: who knew, for certain, what was good? He knew he would have to think it out for a long time. But the female wanted an answer.  \"It is good,\" he said casually.  The female accepted that with quiet passivity. \"My name is Dara,\" she said. \"It is what I am called.\"  Cadnan said: \"I am Cadnan.\" He found himself tired, and Dara apparently saw this and withdrew, leaving him to sleep.  But his sleep was troubled, and it seemed a long time before day came and the door opened again to show the masters with their strange metal tubes standing outside in the corridor.     4   \"I'm not going to take no for an answer.\"  Albin stood in the doorway of his room, slouching against the metal lintel and looking even more like a gnome. Dodd sighed softly and got up from the single chair. \"I'm not anxious for a party,\" he said. \"All I want to do is go to sleep.\"  \"At nine o'clock?\" Albin shook his head.  \"Maybe I'm tired.\"  \"You're not tired,\" Albin said. \"You're scared. You're scared of what you might find out there in the cold, cruel world, friend. You're scared of parties and strange people and noise. You want to be left alone to brood, right?\"  \"No, I--\"  \"But I'm not going to leave you alone to brood,\" Albin said. \"Because I'm your friend. And brooding isn't good for you. It's brooding that's got you into such a state--where you worry about growing things, for God's sake, and about freedom and silly things like that.\" Albin grinned. \"What you've got to do is stop worrying, and I know how to get you to do that, kiddo. I really do.\"  \"Sure you do,\" Dodd said, and his voice began to rise. He went to the bed, walked along its length to the window, as he talked, never facing Albin. \"You know how to make me feel just fine, no worries at all, no complications, just a nice, simple life. With nothing at all in it, Albin. Nothing at all.\"  \"Now, come on--\" Albin began.  \"Nothing,\" Dodd said. \"Go to parties, drink, meet a girl, forget, go right on forgetting, and then one day you wake up and it's over and what have you got?\"  \"Parties,\" Albin said. \"Girls. Drinks. What else is there?\"  \"A lot,\" Dodd said. \"I want--oh, God, I don't know what I want. Too much. Too many ideas ... trapped here being a master, and that's no good.\"  \"Dodd,\" Albin said, in what was almost a worried tone, \"what the hell are you talking about?\"  \"Being a master,\" Dodd said. \"There shouldn't be masters. Or slaves. Just--beings, able to do what they want to do ... what makes me any better than the Alberts, anyhow?\"  \"The Belbis beam, for one thing,\" Albin said. \"Position, power, protection, punishment. What makes anybody better than anybody else?\"  \"But that's the point--don't you see?\"  Albin stood upright, massaging his arm. \"What I see is a case of worry,\" he said, \"and as a doctor I have certain responsibilities. I've got to take care of that case of worries, and I'm not going to take no for an answer.\"  \"Leave me alone,\" Dodd said. \"Just do me a favor. Leave me alone.\"  \"Come with me,\" Albin said. \"This once. Look--what can you lose? Just once can't hurt you--you can do all the brooding you want to do some other time. Give me a present. Come to the party with me.\"  \"I don't like parties.\"  \"And I don't like going alone,\" Albin said. \"So do me a favor.\"  \"Where is it?\" Dodd asked after a second.  Albin beamed. \"Psych division,\" he said. \"Come on.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The metal door was festooned with paper drapery in red and blue. Dodd turned before they got to it, standing about five feet down the corridor. \"How did you find out about a party in Psych division?\" he asked.  Albin shrugged. \"I'm an active type,\" he said. \"I've got friends all over. You'd be surprised how many friends a man can have, Dodd, if he goes to parties. If he meets people instead of brooding.\"  \"All right,\" Dodd said. \"I'm here, aren't I? You've convinced me--stop the propaganda.\"  \"Sure.\" Albin went up to the door and knocked. From inside they could hear a dim babel of voices. After a second he knocked again, more loudly.  A voice rose above the hum. \"Who's there?\"  \"A friend,\" Albin said. \"The password is Haenlingen-on-fire.\"  The voice broke into laughter. \"Oh,\" it said. It was now distinguishingly a female voice. \"It's you, Cendar. But hold it down on the Haenlingen stuff: she's supposed to be arriving.\"  \"At a party?\" Albin said. \"She's a hundred and twelve--older than that. What does she want with parties? Don't be silly.\"  The door opened. A slim, blonde girl stood by it, her mouth still grinning. \"Cendar, I mean it,\" she said. \"You watch out. One of these days you're going to get into trouble.\"  Behind her the hum had risen to a chorus of mad clatter, conversation, laughter, song--the girl dragged Albin and Dodd inside and shut the door. \"I'm always in trouble,\" Albin was saying. \"It keeps life interesting.\" But it was hard to hear him, hard to hear any single voice in the swell of noise.  \"Thank God for soundproofing,\" the girl said. \"We can do whatever we like and there's no noise out there.\"  \"The drapes give you away,\" Albin said.  \"Let the drapes give us away,\" the girl said. \"We're entitled to have quiet little gatherings, right? And who knows what goes on behind the drapes?\"  \"Right,\" Albin said. \"You are right. You are absolutely, incredibly, stunningly right. And to prove how right you are I'm going to do you a favor.\"  \"What kind of favor?\" the girl said with mock suspicion.  \"Greta,\" Albin said, \"I'm going to introduce you to a nice young man.\"  \"You don't know any nice young men.\"  \"I know this one,\" Albin said. \"Greta Forzane, Johnny Dodd. Take good care of him, kiddo--he needs it.\"  \"What do you mean, good care of him?\" she said. But Albin was gone, into the main body of the party, a melee confused enough so that he was lost in twenty steps. Greta turned back almost hopeless eyes.  A second passed.  \"You a friend of Cendar's?\" Greta asked.  Johnny blinked and came back to her. \"Oh, Albin?\" he said. \"We're--acquaintances.\"  \"Friends,\" Greta said firmly. \"That's nice. He's such a nice guy--I bet you are, too.\" She smiled and took his arm. Her hand was slightly warm and very dry. Johnny took his first real look at her: she seemed shining, somehow, as if the hair had been lacquered, the face sprayed with a clear polish. The picture she made was vaguely unpleasant, and a little threatening.  \"A nice guy?\" he"]]]
