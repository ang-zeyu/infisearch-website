You think he can, don't you? Don't you?\"  \"He can do anything any space skipper has ever done, and more,\" said Sue Eagen, and her face glowed. \"But it isn't easy. Right this minute he's working over the computer--a small, simple, ship-board computer--working out orbital and positional and blast-intensity data that would be a hard nut for the giant calculators on Earth to crack. And he's doing it in half the time--or less--than it would take the average mathematician, because he has to; because it's a life-and-death matter if he makes a mistake or takes too long.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"But--but--\"  \"But what?\" Miss Eagen's composure seemed to have been blasted to shreds by the powerful currents of her indignation. Her eyes flashed. \"You mean, but why doesn't he just work the ship while it's spinning the same way he does when it isn't?\"  Through a growing fear, Marcia nodded mutely.  \"He'll spin the ship on its long axis,\" said the stewardess with exaggerated patience. \"That means that the steering jet tubes in the nose and tail are spinning, too. You don't just turn with a blast on one tube or another. The blasts have to be let off in hundreds of short bursts, timed to the hundredth of a second, to be able to make even a slight course correction. The sighting instruments are wheeling round and round while you're checking your position. Your fuel has to be calculated to the last ounce--because enough fuel for a Moon flight, with hours of fuelless free-fall, and enough fuel for a power spin and course corrections while spinning, are two very different things. Captain McHenry won't be able to maneuver to a landing on the Moon. He'll do it exactly right the first time, or not at all.\"  Marcia was white and still. \"I--I never--\"  \"But I haven't told you the toughest part of it yet,\" Miss Eagen went on inexorably. \"A ship as massive as this, spinning on its long axis, is a pretty fair gyroscope. It doesn't want to turn. Any force that tries to make it turn is resisted at right angles to the force applied. When that force is applied momentarily from jets, as they swing into position and away again, the firing formulas get--well, complex. And the ship's course and landing approach are completely new. Instead of letting the ship fall to the Moon, turning over and approaching tail-first with the main jets as brakes, Captain McHenry is going to have to start the spin first and go almost the whole way nose-first. He'll come up on the Moon obliquely, pass it, stop the spin, turn over once to check the speed of the ship, and once again to put the tail down when the Moon's gravity begins to draw us in. There'll be two short periods of free-fall there, but they won't be long enough to bother you much. And if we can do all that with the fuel we've got, it will be a miracle. A miracle from the brain of Captain McHenry.\"  Marcia forced herself away from the bulkhead with a small whimper of hurt and hatred--hatred of the stars, of this knowledgeable, inspired girl, and--even more so--of herself. She darted toward the door.  Miss Eagen was beside her in an instant, a hard small hand on her arm. \"Where are you going?\"  \"I'm going to stop him. He can't take that chance with his ship, with these people....\"  \"He will and he must. You surely know your husband.\"  \"I know him as well as you do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Miss Eagen's firm lips shut in a thin hard line. \"Do as you like,\" she whispered. \"And while you're doing it--think about whom he's spinning ship for.\" She took her hand from Marcia's arm.  Marcia twisted away and went into the corridor.  She found herself at the entrance to the pilot room. In one sweeping glance she saw a curved, silver board. Before it a man sat tranquilly. Nearer to her was Jack, hunched over the keyboard of a complex, compact machine, like a harried bookkeeper on the last day of the month.  Her lips formed his name, but she was silent. She watched him, his square, competent hands, his detached and distant face. Through the forward view-plate she saw a harsh, jagged line, the very edge of the Moon's disc. Next to it, and below, was the rear viewer, holding the shimmering azure shape of Earth.  \"_All Earth watches me when I work, but with your eyes._\"  Jack had said that to her once, long ago, when he still loved her.  \"... human damnfoolishness botching up the equations....\" He had said that once, too.  Miss Eagen was standing by the hospital door, watching her. When Marcia turned away without speaking to Jack, Miss Eagen smiled and held out her hand.  Marcia went to her and took the hand. They went into the hospital. Miss Eagen didn't speak; she seemed to be waiting.  \"Yes, I know who Jack's spinning the ship for,\" said Marcia.  Miss Eagen looked an unspoken question.  Marcia said, painfully, \"He's like the Captain of the _Elsinore_. He's risking his life for a--a stranger. A jaywalker. Not for me. Not even for his baby.\"  \"Does it hurt to know that?\"  Marcia looked into the smooth, strong face and said with genuine astonishment, \"Hurt? Oh, no! It's so--so big!\"  There was a sudden thunder. Over Miss Eagen's shoulder, through the port, Marcia saw the stars begin to move. Miss Eagen followed her gaze. \"He's started the spin. You'll be all right now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Marcia could never recall the rest of the details of the trip. There was the outboard bulkhead that drew her like a magnet, increasingly, until suddenly it wasn't an attracting wall, but normally and naturally \"down.\" Then a needle, and another one, and a long period of deep drowsiness and unreality.  But through and through that drugged, relaxed period, Jack and the stars, the Moon and Sue Eagen danced and wove. Words slipped in and out of it like shreds of melody:  \"A man comes to love the things he has to fight for.\" And Jack fighting--for his ship, for the Moon, for the new-building traditions of the great ones who would carry humanity out to the stars.  Sue Eagen was there, too, and the thing she shared with Jack. Of course there was something between them--so big a thing that there was nothing for her to fear in it.  Jack and Sue Eagen had always had it, and always would have; and now Marcia had it too. And with understanding replacing fear, Marcia was free to recall that Jack had worked with Sue Eagen--but it was Marcia that he had loved and married.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a long time of blackness, and then a time of agony, when she was falling, falling, and her lungs wanted to split, explode, disintegrate, and someone kept saying, \"Hold tight, Marcia; hold tight to me,\" and she found Sue Eagen's cool strong hands in hers.  _Marcia. She called me Marcia._  More blackness, more pain--but not so much this time; and then a long, deep sleep.  A curved ceiling, but a new curve, and soft rose instead of the gunmetal-and-chrome of the ship. White sheets, a new feeling of \"down\" that was unlike either Earth or the ship, a novel and exhilarating buoyancy. And kneeling by the bed--  \"Jack!\"  \"You're all right, honey.\"  She raised herself on her elbow and looked out through the unglazed window at the ordered streets of the great Luna Dome. \"The Moon.... Jack, you did it!\"  He snapped his fingers. He looked like a high-school kid. \"Nothin' to it.\" She could see he was very proud. Very tired, too. He reached out to touch her.  She drew back. \"You don't have to be sweet to me,\" she said quietly. \"I understand how you must feel.\"  \"Don't _have_ to?\" He rose, bent over her, and slid his arms around her. He put his face into the shadowed warmth between her hair and her neck and said, \"Listen, egghead, there's no absolute scale for courage. We had a bad time, both of us. After it was over, and I had a chance to think, I used it trying to look at things through your eyes. And that way I found out that when you walked up that gangway, you did the bravest thing I've ever known anyone to do. And you did it for me. It doesn't matter what else happened. Sue told me a lot about you that I didn't know, darling. You're ... real huge for your size. As for the bad part of what happened--nothing like it can ever happen again, can it?\"  He hugged her. After a time he reached down and touched her swelling waist. It was like a benediction. \"He'll be born on the Moon,\" he whispered, \"and he'll have eyes the color of all Earth when it looks out to the stars.\"  \"_She'll_ be born on the Moon,\" corrected Marcia, \"and her name will be Sue, and ... and she'll be almost as good as her father.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51037"],["title","Second Childhood (#0)"],["body","Childhood                           By CLIFFORD D.

The other half is knowing how to live with it once                it's been made possible--and inescapable!   You did not die.  There was no normal way to die.  You lived as carelessly and as recklessly as you could and you hoped that you would be lucky and be accidentally killed.  You kept on living and you got tired of living.  \"God, how tired a man can get of living!\" Andrew Young said.  John Riggs, chairman of the immortality commission, cleared his throat.  \"You realize,\" he said to Andrew Young, \"that this petition is a highly irregular procedure to bring to our attention.\"  He picked up the sheaf of papers off the table and ruffled through them rapidly.  \"There is no precedent,\" he added.  \"I had hoped,\" said Andrew Young, \"to establish precedent.\"  Commissioner Stanford said, \"I must admit that you have made a good case, Ancestor Young. Yet you must realize that this commission has no possible jurisdiction over the life of any person, except to see that everyone is assured of all the benefits of immortality and to work out any kinks that may show up.\"  \"I am well aware of that,\" answered Young, \"and it seems to me that my case is one of the kinks you mention.\"  He stood silently, watching the faces of the members of the board. They are afraid, he thought. Every one of them. Afraid of the day they will face the thing I am facing now. They have sought an answer and there is no answer yet except the pitifully basic answer, the brutally fundamental answer that I have given them.  \"My request is simple,\" he told them, calmly. \"I have asked for permission to discontinue life. And since suicide has been made psychologically impossible, I have asked that this commission appoint a panel of next-friends to make the necessary and somewhat distasteful arrangements to bring about the discontinuance of my life.\"  \"If we did,\" said Riggs, \"we would destroy everything we have. There is no virtue in a life of only five thousand years. No more than in a life of only a hundred years. If Man is to be immortal, he must be genuinely immortal. He cannot compromise.\"  \"And yet,\" said Young, \"my friends are gone.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He gestured at the papers Riggs held in his hands. \"I have them listed there,\" he said. \"Their names and when and where and how they died. Take a look at them. More than two hundred names. People of my own generation and of the generations closely following mine. Their names and the photo-copies of their death certificates.\"  He put both of his hands upon the table, palms flat against the table, and leaned his weight upon his arms.  \"Take a look at how they died,\" he said. \"Every one involves accidental violence. Some of them drove their vehicles too fast and, more than likely, very recklessly. One fell off a cliff when he reached down to pick a flower that was growing on its edge. A case of deliberately poor judgment, to my mind. One got stinking drunk and took a bath and passed out in the tub. He drowned....\"  \"Ancestor Young,\" Riggs said sharply, \"you are surely not implying these folks were suicides.\"  \"No,\" Andrew Young said bitterly. \"We abolished suicide three thousand years ago, cleared it clean out of human minds. How could they have killed themselves?\"  Stanford said, peering up at Young, \"I believe, sir, you sat on the board that resolved that problem.\"  Andrew Young nodded. \"It was after the first wave of suicides. I remember it quite well. It took years of work. We had to change human perspective, shift certain facets of human nature. We had to condition human reasoning by education and propaganda and instill a new set of moral values. I think we did a good job of it. Perhaps too good a job. Today a man can no more think of deliberately committing suicide than he could think of overthrowing our government. The very idea, the very word is repulsive, instinctively repulsive. You can come a long way, gentlemen, in three thousand years.\"  He leaned across the table and tapped the sheaf of papers with a lean, tense finger.  \"They didn't kill themselves,\" he said. \"They did not commit suicide. They just didn't give a damn. They were tired of living ... as I am tired of living. So they lived recklessly in every way. Perhaps there always was a secret hope that they would drown while drunk or their car would hit a tree or....\"         *       *       *       *       *  He straightened up and faced them. \"Gentlemen,\" he said. \"I am 5,786 years of age. I was born at Lancaster, Maine, on the planet Earth on September 21, 1968. I have served humankind well in those fifty-seven centuries. My record is there for you to see. Boards, commissions, legislative posts, diplomatic missions. No one can say that I have shirked my duty. I submit that I have paid any debt I owe humanity ... even the well-intentioned debt for a chance at immortality.\"  \"We wish,\" said Riggs, \"that you would reconsider.\"  \"I am a lonely man,\" replied Young. \"A lonely man and tired. I have no friends. There is nothing any longer that holds my interest. It is my hope that I can make you see the desirability of assuming jurisdiction in cases such as mine. Someday you may find a solution to the problem, but until that time arrives, I ask you, in the name of mercy, to give us relief from life.\"  \"The problem, as we see it,\" said Riggs, \"is to find some way to wipe out mental perspective. When a man lives as you have, sir, for fifty centuries, he has too long a memory. The memories add up to the disadvantage of present realities and prospects for the future.\"  \"I know,\" said Young. \"I remember we used to talk about that in the early days. It was one of the problems which was recognized when immortality first became practical. But we always thought that memory would erase itself, that the brain could accommodate only so many memories, that when it got full up it would dump the old ones. It hasn't worked that way.\"  He made a savage gesture. \"Gentlemen, I can recall my childhood much more vividly than I recall anything that happened yesterday.\"  \"Memories are buried,\" said Riggs, \"and in the old days, when men lived no longer than a hundred years at most, it was thought those buried memories were forgotten. Life, Man told himself, is a process of forgetting. So Man wasn't too worried over memories when he became immortal. He thought he would forget them.\"  \"He should have known,\" argued Young. \"I can remember my father, and I remember him much more intimately than I will remember you gentlemen once I leave this room.... I can remember my father telling me that, in his later years, he could recall things which happened in his childhood that had been forgotten all his younger years. And that, alone, should have tipped us off. The brain buries only the newer memories deeply ... they are not available; they do not rise to bother one, because they are not sorted or oriented or correlated or whatever it is that the brain may do with them. But once they are all nicely docketed and filed, they pop up in an instant.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Riggs nodded agreement. \"There's a lag of a good many years in the brain's bookkeeping. We will overcome it in time.\"  \"We have tried,\" said Stanford. \"We tried conditioning, the same solution that worked with suicides. But in this, it didn't work. For a man's life is built upon his memories. There are certain basic memories that must remain intact. With conditioning, you could not be selective. You could not keep the structural memories and winnow out the trash. It didn't work that way.\"  \"There was one machine that worked,\" Riggs put in. \"It got rid of memories. I don't understand exactly how it worked, but it did the job all right. It did too good a job. It swept the mind as clean as an empty room. It didn't leave a thing. It took all memories and it left no capacity to build a new set. A man went in a human being and came out a vegetable.\"  \"Suspended animation,\" said Stanford, \"would be a solution. If we had suspended animation. Simply stack a man away until we found the answer, then revive and recondition him.\"  \"Be that as it may,\" Young told them, \"I should like your most earnest consideration of my petition. I do not feel quite equal to waiting until you have the answer solved.\"  Riggs said, harshly, \"You are asking us to legalize death.\"  Young nodded. \"If you wish to phrase it that way. I'm asking it in the name of common decency.\"  Commissioner Stanford said, \"We can ill afford to lose you, Ancestor.\"  Young sighed. \"There is that damned attitude again. Immortality pays all debts. When a man is made immortal, he has received full compensation for everything that he may endure. I have lived longer than any man could be expected to live and still I am denied the dignity of old age. A man's desires are few, and quickly sated, and yet he is expected to continue living with desires burned up and blown away to ash. He gets to a point where nothing has a value ... even to a point where his own personal values are no more than shadows. Gentlemen, there was a time when I could not have committed murder ... literally could not have forced myself to kill another man ... but today I could, without a second thought. Disillusion and cynicism have crept in upon me and I have no conscience.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"There are compensations,\" Riggs said. \"Your family....\"  \"They get in my hair,\" said Young disgustedly. \"Thousands upon thousands of young squirts calling me Grandsire and Ancestor and coming to me for advice they"]]]
