She began to mix herself a drink. \"Moonbeam,\" her husband said, \"you won't tell anybody about this little peace conference, will you?\"  \"No,\" she said, looking at Carmody. \"I won't talk.\" She lifted her glass. \"Here's to murder!\"  \"Helen,\" Gabriel insisted, unable to rationalize the vague uneasiness that was nagging at him, \"you won't dare say anything to anybody? Because, if you do, you'll regret it!\"  \"I said I wouldn't talk. Have I ever broken my word?\"  \"You've never had the chance.\" But it would be incredible that she should have the temerity to betray him. After all, she was his wife. She should stick to him out of gratitude and self-interest, for he was rich, at least, and he wasn't exactly repulsive. And he'd been good to her. All men lost their tempers at times.  \"Let's get down to business, huh?\" Carmody said harshly. \"Whom do you want knocked off?\"  \"I don't know his name,\" Gabriel replied, \"but I can describe him.\"  After he had finished doing so, there was a small pause. Carmody was silent. Helen turned back to the bar; her face was concealed from the men. Her body shook a little. Lockard thought she was crying, and wondered again whether his confidence in her was entirely justified.  \"I think maybe I know the guy,\" Carmody went on. \"Only been around the--the parish a couple of days, if it's the life-form I mean.\"  \"Must be the one,\" Lockard told him. \"Think you can do it?\"  \"A cinch,\" Carmody assured him.         *       *       *       *       *  As Helen Lockard emerged from the door marked _Females; Human and Humanoid_, and rounded the turn in the corridor, a brawny arm reached out of a vidiphone booth and yanked her inside. The girl gave a startled cry, then relaxed. \"Oh, it's you; you gave me a turn.\"  \"You're not afraid? You know who I am, then?\"  She nodded. \"You're the real Gabriel Lockard.\" His big body was pressing hers in the close-fitting confines of the booth. In some ways it could be considered more attractive than her husband's. \"Why are you hiding here?\"  \"I'm not hiding, I'm lurking,\" he explained. \"Wouldn't do for me to appear too openly. The police--that is, the hounds--are on Carmody's trail. I don't want them to find me.\"  \"Oh.\" She pulled away from him. She mustn't let her interest be aroused in a body so soon to be discarded.  \"I've been looking for an opportunity to talk to you since last night,\" he growled, the only way he could gentle a voice as deep as the thick vocal cords of the body produced. \"But your husband is always around.... You haven't told him who I was, have you?\"  She shook her head slowly, reproachfully. \"I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't have told him about the other one either, but I ... well, I guess I jumped or something when I caught sight of him and Gabe mistakenly picked it up.\"  There was a tense silence as they stood almost pressed against one another. \"It's easy to see how you got into Carmody's body,\" she went on, speaking a little too rapidly, \"but how did you happen to get into this particular line of evil?\"  \"Simple--that lawyer your husband went to see sent scouts out to have Carmody picked up. And they flushed me. Naturally I would have turned down the job if he hadn't happened to mention for whom it was....\"  \"That other man is the real Carmody now, isn't he?\" She looked up at him. Her eyes were gray or green; he couldn't determine which. \"So it doesn't matter even if he does get killed.\"  \"But how can he get killed?\" the big man reminded her with a gentleness completely out of keeping with the ferocity of his appearance. \"I'm not a killer, please believe me--I have never killed anybody and I hope I never have to.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She had never thought about who he was--who he had been--before he started playing the game. Gabriel Lockard, of course. But what had Gabriel Lockard been? Surely not the narco-filled, fear-ridden dilettante the man--the body, at least--was now. He couldn't possibly have been or the hulk wouldn't have stood up so well under the treatment it was getting from its current tenant. But all that didn't seem to matter. All she wanted was the rightful man in his rightful body, and that seemed almost impossible of achievement.  \"What do you intend to do?\" she asked, almost sharply.  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"By agreeing to kill this--John Keats he calls himself--I felt I had the situation in hand. And I suppose I have, in a sense. But the end result is a stalemate. I've been following him around just to make everything looks on course for your husband until I decide what to do. Sometimes, though, I get the curious feeling that Keats is following me.\"  \"Maybe for the same reason you've been following Gabriel?\" Helen touched his arm gingerly; it was more muscular than her husband's. \"This isn't a bad body, you know--maybe he sets some store by it.\"  \"But that doesn't make sense!\" he said, impatiently shaking off her hand, not wanting her to like this criminal's body that, despite its superficial attractiveness, fitted him no more easily than any of the others. \"Logically, it seems to me, he should try to get as far away from his own hulk as possible.... Duck! Here comes your husband!\"  He blocked her with his wide body as Gabriel Lockard's swung past the booth, its perfect features marred by a frown. \"Okay,\" he whispered, as Lockard rounded the corner, \"rock back to your table and act angry because he's late.\"  He watched until Gabriel had retraced his steps and gone back to the hotel dining room; then sauntered in the same direction. From the next booth, John Keats stared sullenly after the departing figure. He had been straining his ears, but the booths were effectively soundproofed; all he could learn was that the stranger had developed some kind of quick understanding with Lockard's wife and, knowing the potentialities of his former packaging, this saddened rather than surprised the young man.  He punched Gorman's number without turning on the visual. \"Disembodied,\" he said curtly. \"Look here, Gorman, I've been wondering--just who is this life-form supposed to be sending to the joyful planetoids?\"  \"I haven't any idea,\" Gorman's voice said curiously. \"Didn't seem any of my evil, so I didn't ask. And I don't suppose Lockard would have told me. Why do you want to know?\"  \"Because I don't see him taking a fix on anybody except Lockard's wife and I don't hold with exterminating females except maybe by accident. Besides, I kind of radiate for that tigi myself.\"  The lawyer's voice definitely showed interest. \"Isn't there anybody else he could possibly be after?\"  \"Well--\" John Keats gave a sick laugh--\"there's only one other possible flight pattern. It's kind of extradimensional, but sometimes I think maybe he's after me.\"  There was a long pause. \"Absurd,\" the little lawyer said thoughtfully. \"Absurd. He doesn't even know who you are.\"  Pale blood surfaced under the young man's transparent skin. \"I never thought of that, but you're wrong. He does. He's got to. It was a private game.\" His voice thickened and he had to stop for coughing. \"When you told him he was Jed Carmody, naturally he could figure out who was squatting in his hulk.\"  \"But magnetizing him was your own idea, Johnny,\" Gorman pointed out gently. \"Besides, that's no reason he should be after you; what's the percentage in it? And, anyhow, where does Lockard fit into this?\" He seemed to be asking the question of himself as much as of the other man.  \"Yeah,\" John Keats muttered, \"that's what I've got to find out.\"  \"Me, too,\" Gorman half-whispered.  \"What did you say?\"  \"I said tell me when you find out; I'm sort of curious myself.\"   VIII  \"Look, Gorman,\" Carmody said, \"I'm not working for you; I'm working for Lockard. What's the idea of sending for me this hour of the night?\"  \"Then why did you come this hour of the night when I asked you to?\" the lawyer inquired, leaning back in his chair and smiling.  The big man hesitated and shrugged. \"Can't say, myself. Curiosity, maybe.... But you can hardly expect me to violate my employer's confidence?\"  Gorman laughed. \"You get your ideas from the viddies, don't you? Only don't forget that you're the villain, not the hero, of this piece, fellow-man.\"  Carmody, completely taken aback, stared at him--the little alien couldn't know! And, furthermore, he was mistaken--Carmody, Lockard, the dutchman, had done nothing wrong, committed no crime, violated no ethic. On the other hand, he had done nothing right either, nothing to help himself or any other. \"What do you mean?\" he finally temporized.  \"Tell me this--Lockard hired you to kill the man who goes under the name of John Keats, didn't he?\"  \"Yes, but how did you know that?\" He was beginning to have the same primitive fear of Gorman that he had of the Vinzz; only it was more natural for an extraterrestrial to have apparently supernatural powers.  \"Keats told me--and Keats, of course, is the real Carmody.\"  \"So you found out?\"  \"Found out!\" Gorman laughed. \"I knew it all along. Does a man keep any secrets from his lawyer?\"  \"If he's smart, he does.\" Carmody absently beat his hand on the desk. \"This Keats isn't too smart, though, is he?\"  \"No ... he isn't a very bright guy. But it was his idea that this would be a fine method of getting you out of the way. And not too bad an idea, either.... You had to be disposed of, you know,\" he explained winningly. \"And how nice to have hounds do it for us. Of course we had no idea of who your quarry was.\"  \"I can see your point of view,\" Carmody said ironically. \"But why tell me now?\" And then he thought he saw the answer. \"Are you afraid I'll really kill him?\"  The lawyer shook his head and smiled back. \"Afraid you really won't.\" He placed the tips of his fingers together. \"I am prepared to double whatever Lockard is offering you to make sure that Keats, with Carmody inside him, is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50988"],["title","Bodyguard (#6)"],["body","put out of the way forever.\"         *       *       *       *       *  So even here there was no basis of trust--none of the reverse honor that legend commonly assigned to extralegals. Carmody got up. Even seated, he had towered above the lawyer. Standing, he was like a larger-than-life statue of doom--of doom, Gorman nervously hoped, pointing in the desired direction.  \"And if I refuse?\" Carmody asked.  Gorman moved his chair back uneasily. \"I might persuade Keats that he could risk one murder in his present shape, if it was to insure his ultimate safety.\"  \"Meaning it would be a good idea for him to kill me?\"  \"Meaning it would be an excellent idea for him to kill you.\"  \"Look here, Gorman,\" Carmody said, in a low voice that gradually increased in volume. He could no longer restrain the anger that had been seething up in him for all the years of his wandering. \"I've had enough of all this, hiding, running, shifting bodies and now hiring out as a killer. Because I'm an honest man. Maybe you've never seen one before, so take a good look at me. You may never have the chance again.\"  \"I am looking and I see Jed Carmody. Not my idea of the prototype of honesty.\"  \"But I don't feel like Jed Carmody.\"  \"Tell that to the hounds.\" Gorman laughed uproariously. \"By law, you're responsible for Carmody's crimes. Of course, if they put you away or--as they'd undoubtedly prefer--accidently exterminate you in the line of duty, and _then_ suspect Carmody hulk-hopped, they might look around some more. But there wouldn't be any percentage in that for you, especially if you were dead.\"  \"I know, I know,\" Carmody retorted impatiently. \"You can't tell me anything I haven't told myself.\" He paused for a moment. \"This is a good body, though,\" he added. \"Almost as good as my old one.\"  Gorman raised his eyebrows. \"You can't be referring to the corpus currently going by the epithet of John Keats?\"  \"The name was your idea, I take it. No, that wasn't my original body.\"  \"Oh, so you're a dutchman, eh? A thrill boy?\" There was contempt, even from such as Gorman. \"Getting a lot of free falls out of all this, are you?\"  Carmody tried to ignore this, but he couldn't. It wasn't true, he told himself; he had suffered years of playing the game and derived no pleasure from those sufferings--no pleasure at all. But he would not stoop to argue with Gorman. \"Maybe I can get away with this body to one of the frontier planets,\" he mused. \"At least I can make a run for it; at least that would be a worthwhile kind of running.\"  \"Brave words!\" the lawyer sneered. \"But rather risky to put into action. Don't you think the best thing to do would be just go ahead with the pattern as set? How much did Lockard offer you?\"  \"Half a million credits.\"  Gorman sucked in his breath. \"You're lying, of course, but I'll match that. Carmody--Keats--has ten times that amount and maybe more hidden away where I can lay my hands on it as soon as I'm sure he's where he can't hurt me. It's worth half a million to me. And, in the remote instance that you're telling the truth, you can't turn down a million credits ... whoever you are, dutchman!\"  \"Oh, can't I?\" Carmody went to the door; then turned. \"It may interest you to know that I'm worth a hundred times that amount and maybe more.\"  The lawyer laughed skeptically. \"If you have enough money to buy your way, then why are you doing this?\"  Carmody frowned. \"You wouldn't understand.... I'm not sure I understand myself.\" The door slammed behind him. Descending pneumos hissed.  \"Just talking with his elbows,\" Gorman said comfortingly to himself. \"He'll do it. He's got to do it.\" But he wasn't altogether convinced.   IX  As Carmody left the office building, John Keats' figure emerged from the shadows of a nearby doorway. He looked up at the golden rectangle of Gorman's window and then toward the direction in which Carmody had gone; and bit his lip irresolutely. After a moment's reflection, he chose to follow his old body. Somehow he didn't have much confidence in Gorman any more; not that he'd ever really trusted him. In their line of evil you couldn't afford to trust anybody. He had made a mistake. But it could still be rectified.  If the big man was aware of his tracker, he did not seem to care. He moved purposefully in the direction of the hotel, scorning the helicabs that swooped down to proffer their services, striding through the brilliantly lit avenues gay with music and the dark alleys mournful with the whine of the farjeen wires as if they were all the same.  The hotel was on one of the avenues, because the Lockards always had only the best of whatever there was to be had. Carmody crossed the almost deserted lobby in swift strides and took the pneumo to the seventh floor. Knowing that his body could have only one objective in that place, Keats took the stairs to the basement.  Carmody sprang out of the pneumo exit and ran down the corridor to bang lustily on the intricately embossed metal door of the Lockards' suite. After a moment, the girl, again in negligee, opened it. Her green-gray eyes widened when she saw who the late visitor was, and she put a finger to her lips. \"Shh, Gabe's asleep; let's not wake him unless it's necessary.\" She closed the door softly behind him. \"What is it ... Jed?\"  He was so choked with excitement that he could hardly get the words out. \"Helen; will you make a break with me for Proxima Centauri? They won't ask any questions there, if we can get there. And from Proxima we can go--\"  \"But your body?\"  \"The hell with my body.\" He gripped her arms with powerful hands. \"You mean much more to me than that worthless hulk.\"  \"But, Jed, Gabe'll never let us go....\" Proxima Centauri--that had been Gabriel's dream, too....  His hands pressed so hard into her flesh, she knew there would be bruises on her skin; was she always doomed to fall in love with men who would leave marks on her? \"Let him try to stop us. I'm bigger than he is, now.\"  She looked up at him. \"You always were, darling. But he has influence, though he wouldn't need it; he could simply set the police on you.\"  \"That's the chance we're going to have to take.... But perhaps I'm asking too much. I haven't the right to ask you to take such risks,\" he added bitterly. \"I was thinking only of myself, I see, not of you.\"  \"Oh, no, Jed!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Who're you talking to, Helen?\" a drowsy voice asked from the bedroom. It was followed by the comely person of Gabriel himself, fastening his dressing gown. \"Oh, hello, Carmody.\" His face lighted up avidly, all sleepiness vanishing like a spent milgot. \"Did you do it already?\"  \"No, I didn't. And, what's more, I'm not going to do it!\"  Lockard looked astonished. \"But what's wrong? You said you would.\"  Carmody sighed. \"Yes, I know I did. I was stalling. That's what I've always done--stalled, put things off, hesitated to make decisions. Well, I've made my decision now.\"  \"You're not afraid of him?\" Lockard said in a voice that was meant to be taunting and emerged as querulous. \"A little pipsqueak like that Keats? Or maybe half a million credits isn't enough for you? Is that it?\"  That was enough for the man whose emaciated body was torturedly cramped in the air-conditioning vent and further agonized by the strain of repressing the cough that sought to tear its way out of his chest. He had found out what he wanted to know and, as he inched his way back down to the basement, he was already making plans for getting even with all those he now knew to be enemies. It had been a conspiracy against him from the start; the hounds probably weren't even aware that he was in town. It was Gorman who had told him they knew of his general whereabouts--Gorman, the good friend who had suggested he change bodies, knowing that whatever hulk he wound up with was bound to be more vulnerable than his primal form. And Gorman would pay....  \"More than enough,\" Carmody replied, as unaware of the fact that he had lost one-third of his audience as he had been that he was addressing three rather than two listeners. \"Only I'm not a killer.\"  \"But I understood you were supposed to be a professional exterminator?\"  \"Jed Carmody is a killer. Only I'm not Jed Carmody.\"  Lockard moved backward and stared at the still bigger man.  Lockard retreated still further. \"You--you're him! You were all along!\" He whirled on his wife. \"And you knew, you double-crosser! Knew and didn't tell me! By God, I'll break every bone in your body!\"  \"Lay a hand on her and I'll break every bone in _my_ body!\" Lockard stopped where he was. \"It doesn't mean anything to me any more, you see,\" Carmody explained. \"I wanted it when I didn't have anything else. But now I have Helen. I could kill you, you know. As Carmody, an acknowledged exterminator, I have nothing to lose. But I'm letting you live, as a hostage for Helen.... And, besides, as I've been busy trying to convince everybody all evening, I am _not_ a murderer.\" He turned to the girl. \"_Will_ you come with me to Proxima, Helen?\"  \"Y-yes, Jed,\" she said, looking apprehensively at her husband.  \"Gather your packs. I'm going to the air office to make the arrangements.\" Carmody consulted his chronometer. \"It's three o'clock. I should be back by eight or so. Get some sleep if you can.\"  Her wide frightened eyes turned again toward her husband.  \"Here.\" Jed tossed her the gun Gorman had given him. \"If he tries anything, use it.\"  \"Yes, Jed. But....\"  \"Don't worry; I have another one.\"  The door slammed behind him. \"Gimme that gun, you little tramp!\" Lockard snarled, twisting it out of her flaccid hand.   X  Carmody marched out of the hotel and turned left in the direction of the airstation which stayed open all night. He had walked a short distance when suddenly a high voice came out of the darkness behind him, \"Not so fast, Mr. ... Carmody,\" and a hard knob was pressed in his back.  \"Mr. Keats, I believe,\" Carmody said, wondering why he wasn't frightened.  \"Right"]]]
