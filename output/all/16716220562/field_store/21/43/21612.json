He began to flake off the oxides.  A half hour of work brought him down to phosphor bronze, a huge casting of the almost incorruptible metal. It had weakened structurally over the centuries; he could fit the point of his pick under a corroded boss and pry off great creaking and grumbling striae of the stuff.  Hawkins wished he had an archeologist with him, but didn't dream of returning to his shop and calling one to take over the find. He was an all-around man: by choice and in his free time, an artist in clay and glaze; by necessity, an automotive, electronics and atomic engineer who could also swing a project in traffic control, individual and group psychology, architecture or tool design. He didn't yell for a specialist every time something out of his line came up; there were so few with so much to do....  He trenched around his find, discovering that it was a great brick-shaped bronze mass with an excitingly hollow sound. A long strip of moldering metal from one of the long vertical faces pulled away, exposing red rust that went _whoosh_ and was sucked into the interior of the mass.  It had been de-aired, thought Hawkins, and there must have been an inner jacket of glass which had crystalized through the centuries and quietly crumbled at the first clang of his pick. He didn't know what a vacuum would do to a subject of Levantman shock, but he had hopes, nor did he quite understand what a real estate dealer was, but it might have something to do with pottery. And _anything_ might have a bearing on Topic Number One.         *       *       *       *       *  He flung his pick out of the trench, climbed out and set off at a dog-trot for his shop. A little rummaging turned up a hypo and there was a plasticontainer of salt in the kitchen.  Back at his dig, he chipped for another half hour to expose the juncture of lid and body. The hinges were hopeless; he smashed them off.  Hawkins extended the telescopic handle of the pick for the best leverage, fitted its point into a deep pit, set its built-in fulcrum, and heaved. Five more heaves and he could see, inside the vault, what looked like a dusty marble statue. Ten more and he could see that it was the naked body of Honest John Barlow, Evanston real estate dealer, uncorrupted by time.  The potter found the apex of the trigeminal nerve with his needle's point and gave him 60 cc.  In an hour Barlow's chest began to pump.  In another hour, he rasped, \"Did it work?\"  \"_Did_ it!\" muttered Hawkins.  Barlow opened his eyes and stirred, looked down, turned his hands before his eyes--  \"I'll sue!\" he screamed. \"My clothes! My fingernails!\" A horrid suspicion came over his face and he clapped his hands to his hairless scalp. \"My hair!\" he wailed. \"I'll sue you for every penny you've got! That release won't mean a damned thing in court--I didn't sign away my hair and clothes and fingernails!\"  \"They'll grow back,\" said Hawkins casually. \"Also your epidermis. Those parts of you weren't alive, you know, so they weren't preserved like the rest of you. I'm afraid the clothes are gone, though.\"  \"What is this--the University hospital?\" demanded Barlow. \"I want a phone. No, you phone. Tell my wife I'm all right and tell Sam Immerman--he's my lawyer--to get over here right away. Greenleaf 7-4022. Ow!\" He had tried to sit up, and a portion of his pink skin rubbed against the inner surface of the casket, which was powdered by the ancient crystalized glass. \"What the hell did you guys do, boil me alive? Oh, you're going to pay for this!\"  \"You're all right,\" said Hawkins, wishing now he had a reference book to clear up several obscure terms. \"Your epidermis will start growing immediately. You're not in the hospital. Look here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He handed Barlow the stainless steel plate that had labeled the casket. After a suspicious glance, the man started to read. Finishing, he laid the plate carefully on the edge of the vault and was silent for a spell.  \"Poor Verna,\" he said at last. \"It doesn't say whether she was stuck with the court costs. Do you happen to know--\"  \"No,\" said the potter. \"All I know is what was on the plate, and how to revive you. The dentist accidentally gave you a dose of what we call Levantman shock anesthesia. We haven't used it for centuries; it was powerful, but too dangerous.\"  \"Centuries ...\" brooded the man. \"Centuries ... I'll bet Sam swindled her out of her eyeteeth. Poor Verna. How long ago was it? What year is this?\"  Hawkins shrugged. \"We call it 7-B-936. That's no help to you. It takes a long time for these metals to oxidize.\"  \"Like that movie,\" Barlow muttered. \"Who would have thought it? Poor Verna!\" He blubbered and sniffled, reminding Hawkins powerfully of the fact that he had been found under a flat rock.  Almost angrily, the potter demanded, \"How many children did you have?\"  \"None yet,\" sniffed Barlow. \"My first wife didn't want them. But Verna wants one--wanted one--but we're going to wait until--we _were_ going to wait until--\"  \"Of course,\" said the potter, feeling a savage desire to tell him off, blast him to hell and gone for his work. But he choked it down. There was The Problem to think of; there was always The Problem to think of, and this poor blubberer might unexpectedly supply a clue. Hawkins would have to pass him on.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Come along,\" Hawkins said. \"My time is short.\"  Barlow looked up, outraged. \"How can you be so unfeeling? I'm a human being like--\"  The Los Angeles-Chicago \"rocket\" thundered overhead and Barlow broke off in mid-complaint. \"Beautiful!\" he breathed, following it with his eyes. \"Beautiful!\"  He climbed out of the vault, too interested to be pained by its roughness against his infantile skin. \"After all,\" he said briskly, \"this should have its sunny side. I never was much for reading, but this is just like one of those stories. And I ought to make some money out of it, shouldn't I?\" He gave Hawkins a shrewd glance.  \"You want money?\" asked the potter. \"Here.\" He handed over a fistful of change and bills. \"You'd better put my shoes on. It'll be about a quarter-mile. Oh, and you're--uh, modest?--yes, that was the word. Here.\" Hawkins gave him his pants, but Barlow was excitedly counting the money.  \"Eighty-five, eighty-six--and it's dollars, too! I thought it'd be credits or whatever they call them. 'E Pluribus Unum' and 'Liberty'--just different faces. Say, is there a catch to this? Are these real, genuine, honest twenty-two-cent dollars like we had or just wallpaper?\"  \"They're quite all right, I assure you,\" said the potter. \"I wish you'd come along. I'm in a hurry.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The man babbled as they stumped toward the shop. \"Where are we going--The Council of Scientists, the World Coordinator or something like that?\"  \"Who? Oh, no. We call them 'President' and 'Congress.' No, that wouldn't do any good at all. I'm just taking you to see some people.\"  \"I ought to make plenty out of this. _Plenty!_ I could write books. Get some smart young fellow to put it into words for me and I'll bet I could turn out a best-seller. What's the setup on things like that?\"  \"It's about like that. Smart young fellows. But there aren't any best-sellers any more. People don't read much nowadays. We'll find something equally profitable for you to do.\"  Back in the shop, Hawkins gave Barlow a suit of clothes, deposited him in the waiting room and called Central in Chicago. \"Take him away,\" he pleaded. \"I have time for one more firing and he blathers and blathers. I haven't told him anything. Perhaps we should just turn him loose and let him find his own level, but there's a chance--\"  \"The Problem,\" agreed Central. \"Yes, there's a chance.\"  The potter delighted Barlow by making him a cup of coffee with a cube that not only dissolved in cold water but heated the water to boiling point. Killing time, Hawkins chatted about the \"rocket\" Barlow had admired, and had to haul himself up short; he had almost told the real estate man what its top speed really was--almost, indeed, revealed that it was not a rocket.  He regretted, too, that he had so casually handed Barlow a couple of hundred dollars. The man seemed obsessed with fear that they were worthless since Hawkins refused to take a note or I.O.U. or even a definite promise of repayment. But Hawkins couldn't go into details, and was very glad when a stranger arrived from Central.  \"Tinny-Peete, from Algeciras,\" the stranger told him swiftly as the two of them met at the door. \"Psychist for Poprob. Polasigned special overtake Barlow.\"  \"Thank Heaven,\" said Hawkins. \"Barlow,\" he told the man from the past, \"this is Tinny-Peete. He's going to take care of you and help you make lots of money.\"  The psychist stayed for a cup of the coffee whose preparation had delighted Barlow, and then conducted the real estate man down the corduroy road to his car, leaving the potter to speculate on whether he could at last crack his kilns.  Hawkins, abruptly dismissing Barlow and the Problem, happily picked the chinking from around the door of the number two kiln, prying it open a trifle. A blast of heat and the heady, smoky scent of the reduction fire delighted him. He peered and saw a corner of a shelf glowing cherry-red, becoming obscured by wavering black areas as it lost heat through the opened door. He slipped a charred wood paddle under a mug on the shelf and pulled it out as a sample, the hairs on the back of his hand curling and scorching. The mug crackled and pinged and Hawkins sighed happily.  The bismuth resinate luster had fired to perfection, a haunting film of silvery-black metal with strange bluish lights in it as it turned before the eyes, and the Problem of Population seemed very far away to Hawkins then.         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow and Tinny-Peete arrived at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51233"],["title","The Marching Morons (#2)"],["body","highway where the psychist's car was parked in a safety bay.  \"What--a--_boat_!\" gasped the man from the past.  \"Boat? No, that's my car.\"  Barlow surveyed it with awe. Swept-back lines, deep-drawn compound curves, kilograms of chrome. He ran his hands futilely over the door--or was it the door?--in a futile search for a handle, and asked respectfully, \"How fast does it go?\"  The psychist gave him a keen look and said slowly, \"Two hundred and fifty. You can tell by the speedometer.\"  \"Wow! My old Chevvy could hit a hundred on a straightaway, but you're out of my class, mister!\"  Tinny-Peete somehow got a huge, low door open and Barlow descended three steps into immense cushions, floundering over to the right. He was too fascinated to pay serious attention to his flayed dermis. The dashboard was a lovely wilderness of dials, plugs, indicators, lights, scales and switches.  The psychist climbed down into the driver's seat and did something with his feet. The motor started like lighting a blowtorch as big as a silo. Wallowing around in the cushions, Barlow saw through a rear-view mirror a tremendous exhaust filled with brilliant white sparkles.  \"Do you like it?\" yelled the psychist.  \"It's terrific!\" Barlow yelled back. \"It's--\"  He was shut up as the car pulled out from the bay into the road with a great _voo-ooo-ooom_! A gale roared past Barlow's head, though the windows seemed to be closed; the impression of speed was terrific. He located the speedometer on the dashboard and saw it climb past 90, 100, 150, 200.  \"Fast enough for me,\" yelled the psychist, noting that Barlow's face fell in response. \"Radio?\"  He passed over a surprisingly light object like a football helmet, with no trailing wires, and pointed to a row of buttons. Barlow put on the helmet, glad to have the roar of air stilled, and pushed a pushbutton. It lit up satisfyingly and Barlow settled back even farther for a sample of the brave new world's super-modern taste in ingenious entertainment.  \"TAKE IT AND STICK IT!\" a voice roared in his ears.         *       *       *       *       *  He snatched off the helmet and gave the psychist an injured look. Tinny-Peete grinned and turned a dial associated with the pushbutton layout. The man from the past donned the helmet again and found the voice had lowered to normal.  \"The show of shows! The super-show! The super-duper show! The quiz of quizzes! _Take it and stick it!_\"  There were shrieks of laughter in the background.  \"Here we got the contes-tants all ready to go. You know how we work it. I hand a contes-tant a triangle-shaped cut-out and like that down the line. Now we got these here boards, they got cut-out places the same shape as the triangles and things, only they're all different shapes, and the first contes-tant that sticks the cutouts into the board, he wins.  \"Now I'm gonna innaview the first contes-tant. Right here, honey. What's your name?\"  \"Name? Uh--\"  \"Hoddaya like that, folks? She don't remember her name! Hah? _Would you buy that for a quarter?_\" The question was spoken with arch significance, and the audience shrieked, howled and whistled its appreciation.  It was dull listening when you didn't know the punch lines and catch lines. Barlow pushed another button, with his free hand ready at the volume control.  \"--latest from Washington. It's about Senator Hull-Mendoza. He is still attacking the Bureau of Fisheries. The North California Syndicalist says he got affidavits that John Kingsley-Schultz is a bluenose from way back. He didn't publistat the affydavits, but he says they say that Kingsley-Schultz was saw at bluenose meetings in Oregon State College and later at Florida University. Kingsley-Schultz says he gotta confess he did major in fly-casting at Oregon and got his Ph.D. in game-fish at Florida.  \"And here is a quote from Kingsley-Schultz: 'Hull-Mendoza don't know what he's talking about. He should drop dead.' Unquote. Hull-Mendoza says he won't publistat the affydavits to pertect his sources. He says they was sworn by three former employes of the Bureau which was fired for in-com-petence and in-com-pat-ibility by Kingsley-Schultz.  \"Elsewhere they was the usual run of traffic accidents. A three-way pileup of cars on Route 66 going outta Chicago took twelve lives. The Chicago-Los Angeles morning rocket crashed and exploded in the Mo-have--Mo-javvy--what-ever-you-call-it Desert. All the 94 people aboard got killed. A Civil Aeronautics Authority investigator on the scene says that the pilot was buzzing herds of sheep and didn't pull out in time.  \"Hey! Here's a hot one from New York! A Diesel tug run wild in the harbor while the crew was below and shoved in the port bow of the luck-shury liner _S. S. Placentia_. It says the ship filled and sank taking the lives of an es-ti-mated 180 passengers and 50 crew members. Six divers was sent down to study the wreckage, but they died, too, when their suits turned out to be fulla little holes.  \"And here is a bulletin I just got from Denver. It seems--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow took off the headset uncomprehendingly. \"He seemed so callous,\" he yelled at the driver. \"I was listening to a newscast--\"  Tinny-Peete shook his head and pointed at his ears. The roar of air was deafening. Barlow frowned baffledly and stared out of the window.  A glowing sign said:           MOOGS!     WOULD YOU BUY IT      FOR A QUARTER?  He didn't know what Moogs was or were; the illustration showed an incredibly proportioned girl, 99.9 per cent naked, writhing passionately in animated full color.  The roadside jingle was still with him, but with a new feature. Radar or something spotted the car and alerted the lines of the jingle. Each in turn sped along a roadside track, even with the car, so it could be read before the next line was alerted.      IF THERE'S A GIRL      YOU WANT TO GET       DEFLOCCULIZE     UNROMANTIC SWEAT.     \"A*R*M*P*I*T*T*O\"  Another animated job, in two panels, the familiar \"Before and After.\" The first said, \"Just Any Cigar?\" and was illustrated with a two-person domestic tragedy of a wife holding her nose while her coarse and red-faced husband puffed a slimy-looking rope. The second panel glowed, \"Or a VUELTA ABAJO?\" and was illustrated with--  Barlow blushed and looked at his feet until they had passed the sign.  \"Coming into Chicago!\" bawled Tinny-Peete.  Other cars were showing up, all of them dreamboats.  Watching them, Barlow began to wonder if he knew what a kilometer was, exactly. They seemed to be traveling so slowly, if you ignored the roaring air past your ears and didn't let the speedy lines of the dreamboats fool you. He would have sworn they were really crawling along at twenty-five, with occasional spurts up to thirty. How much was a kilometer, anyway?  The city loomed ahead, and it was just what it ought to be: towering skyscrapers, overhead ramps, landing platforms for helicopters--  He clutched at the cushions. Those two 'copters. They were going to--they were going to--they--  He didn't see what happened because their apparent collision courses took them behind a giant building.         *       *       *       *       *  Screamingly sweet blasts of sound surrounded them as they stopped for a red light. \"What the hell is going on here?\" said Barlow in a shrill, frightened voice, because the braking time was just about zero, he wasn't hurled against the dashboard. \"Who's kidding who?\"  \"Why, what's the matter?\" demanded the driver.  The light changed to green and he started the pickup. Barlow stiffened as he realized that the rush of air past his ears began just a brief, unreal split-second before the car was actually moving. He grabbed for the door handle on his side.  The city grew on them slowly: scattered buildings, denser buildings, taller buildings, and a red light ahead. The car rolled to a stop in zero braking time, the rush of air cut off an instant after it stopped, and Barlow was out of the car and running frenziedly down a sidewalk one instant after that.  _They'll track me down_, he thought, panting. _It's a secret police thing. They'll get you--mind-reading machines, television eyes everywhere, afraid you'll tell their slaves about freedom and stuff. They don't let anybody cross them, like that story I once read._  Winded, he slowed to a walk and congratulated himself that he had guts enough not to turn around. That was what they always watched for. Walking, he was just another business-suited back among hundreds. He would be safe, he would be safe--  A hand tumbled from a large, coarse, handsome face thrust close to his: \"Wassamatta bumpinninna people likeya owna sidewalk gotta miner slamya inna mushya bassar!\" It was neither the mad potter nor the mad driver.  \"Excuse me,\" said Barlow. \"What did you say?\"  \"Oh, yeah?\" yelled the stranger dangerously, and waited for an answer.  Barlow, with the feeling that he had somehow been suckered into the short end of an intricate land-title deal, heard himself reply belligerently, \"Yeah!\"  The stranger let go of his shoulder and snarled, \"Oh, yeah?\"  \"Yeah!\" said Barlow, yanking his jacket back into shape.  \"Aaah!\" snarled the stranger, with more contempt and disgust than ferocity. He added an obscenity current in Barlow's time, a standard but physiologically impossible directive, and strutted off hulking his shoulders and balling his fists.         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow walked on, trembling. Evidently he had handled it well enough. He stopped at a red light while the long, low dreamboats roared before him and pedestrians in the sidewalk flow with him threaded their ways through the stream of cars. Brakes screamed, fenders clanged and dented, hoarse cries flew back and forth between drivers and walkers. He leaped backward frantically as one car swerved over an arc of sidewalk to miss another.  The signal changed to green, the cars kept on coming for about thirty seconds and then dwindled to an"]]]
