At Henderson where eight converts were baptized, great power was manifested at the confirmation, when the members spoke in tongues and prophesied.  With his brother, Ira, David returned in the early autumn of 1833 to Kirtland, where he worked on the temple for a month. Before winter set in that year, David had removed his wife and their effects from Michigan to Florence, Ohio, where he remained till the latter part of November. Having been sickly, five weeks of the seven he spent at home that fall, David commended himself into the hands of the Lord and went into the neighboring country to preach. But there was a field more in need of his labors than this, for he had not been from home more than two weeks when the word of the Lord came to him as follows:  \"Depart from your field of labor, and go unto Kirtland, for behold, I will send thee up to the land of Zion, for behold, thou shalt serve thy brethren there.\"    III.  Condition of Saints in Missouri--Revelation to them--With William D. Pratt, David goes to Missouri--Ministering to the suffering--Freedom from animosity--Mission to Tennessee--Healing of Mrs. Lane.  Greatly were his brethren in Zion in need of whatever services David could render them. About the time of his arrival at Kirtland after receiving the word of the Lord, a letter came to the Prophet from Elder W. W. Phelps, dated Clay County, Missouri, in which among other things he says:  \"The situation of the Saints, as scattered, is dubious and affords a gloomy prospect. No regular order can be enforced, nor any usual discipline kept up; among the world, yea, among the most wicked part of it, some commit one sin and some another (I speak of the rebellious, for there are Saints that are as immovable as the everlasting hills,) and what can be done? We are in Clay, Ray, Lafayette, Jackson, Van Buren, etc., and cannot hear from each other oftener than we do from you.  \"I know it was right that we should be driven out of the land of Zion, that the rebellious might be sent away. But, brethren, if the Lord will, I should like to know what the honest in heart shall do.\"  On December 16th, 1833, the Lord gave, in answer to this inquiry, the following revelation:   \"1. Verily I say unto you, concerning your brethren who have been  afflicted, and persecuted, and cast out from the land of their  inheritance,   \"2. I, the Lord, have suffered the affliction to come upon them,  wherewith they have been afflicted, in consequence of their  transgressions;   \"3. Yet I will own them, and they shall be mine in that day when I  shall come to make up my jewels.   \"4. Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as  Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son;   \"5. For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot  be sanctified.   \"6. Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, and  envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them;  therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances.   \"7. They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God,  therefore the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to  answer them in the day of their trouble.   \"8. In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but,  in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.   \"9. Verily, I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are  filled with compassion towards them: I will not utterly cast them off;  and in the day of wrath I will remember mercy.   \"10. I have sworn, and the decree hath gone forth by a former  commandment which I have given unto you, that I would let fall the  sword of mine indignation in the behalf of my people; and even as I  have said, it shall come to pass.   \"11. Mine indignation is soon to be poured out without measure upon  all nations, and this will I do when the cup of their iniquity is full.   \"12. And in that day all who are found upon the watch tower, or in  other words, all mine Israel shall be saved.   \"13. And they that have been scattered shall be gathered;   \"14. And all they who have mourned shall be comforted;   \"15. And all they who have given their lives for my name shall be  crowned.   \"16. Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all  flesh is in mine hands: be still and know that I am God.   \"17. Zion shall not be moved out of her place, notwithstanding her  children are scattered;   \"18. They that remain, and are pure in heart, shall return, and  come to their inheritances, they and their children, with songs of  everlasting joy to build up the waste places of Zion;   \"19. And all these things that the prophets might be fulfilled.   \"20. And, behold, there is none other place appointed than that which  I have appointed; neither shall there be any other place appointed  than that which I have appointed, for the work of the gathering of my  saints,   \"21. Until the day cometh when there is found no more room for them;  and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they  shall be called Stakes, for the curtains, or the strength of Zion.   \"22. Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and  worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, should gather  together, and stand in holy places,   \"23. And prepare for the revelation which is to come, when the veil of  the covering of my temple, in my tabernacle, which hideth the earth,  shall be taken off, and all flesh shall see me together.   \"24. And every corruptible thing, both of man, or of the beasts of the  field, or of the fowls of the heavens, or of the fish of the sea, that  dwell upon all the face of the earth, shall be consumed;   \"25. And also that of element shall melt with fervent heat; and all  things shall become new, that my knowledge and glory may dwell upon  all the earth.   \"26. And in that day the enmity of man, and the enmity of beasts, yea,  the enmity of all flesh, shall cease from before my face.   \"27. And in that day whatsoever any man shall ask, it shall be given  unto him.   \"28. And in that day Satan shall not have power to tempt any man.   \"29. And there shall be no sorrow because there is no death.   \"30. In that day an infant shall not die until he is old, and his life  shall be as the age of a tree.   \"31. And when he dies he shall not sleep, (that is to say in the  earth,) but shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and shall be  caught up, and his rest shall be glorious.   \"32. Yea, verily I say unto you, in that day when the Lord shall come,  he shall reveal all things--   \"33. Things which have passed, and hidden things which no man  knew--things of the earth, by which it was made, and the purposes, and  the end thereof--   \"34. Things most precious--things that are above, and things that are  beneath--things that are in the earth, and upon the earth, and in  heaven.   \"35. And all they who suffer persecution for my name, and endure in  faith, though they are called to lay down their lives for my sake, yet  shall they partake of all this glory.   \"36. Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy  is not full, but in me your joy is full.   \"37. Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body;  but care for the soul, and for the life of the soul;   \"38. And seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may  possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life.   \"39. When men are called unto mine everlasting gospel, and covenant  with an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the salt of the  earth, and the savor of men;   \"40. They are called to be the savor of men. Therefore, if that salt  of the earth lose its savor, behold, it is thenceforth good for  nothing, only to be cast out, and trodden under the feet of men.   \"41. Behold, here is wisdom concerning the children of Zion, even  many, but not all; they were found transgressors, therefore they must  needs be chastened.   \"42. He that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that abaseth  himself shall be exalted.   \"43. And now, I will show unto you a parable, that you may know my  will concerning the redemption of Zion.   \"44. A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said  unto his servants, Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice  piece of land, and plant twelve olive trees,   \"45. And set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one  may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower,  that mine olive trees may not be broken down, when the enemy shall  come to spoil, and take unto themselves the fruit of my vineyard.   \"46. Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord  commanded them; and planted the olive trees, and built a hedge round  about, and set watchmen, and began to build a tower.   \"47. And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began  to say among themselves, And what need hath my lord of this tower?   \"48. And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves, What need  hath my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace?   \"49. Might not this money be given to the exchangers? for there is no  need of these things!   \"50. And while they were at variance one with another they became very  slothful, and they hearkened not unto the commandments of their lord,   \"51. And the enemy came by night, and broke down the hedge, and the  servants of the nobleman arose and were affrighted, and fled; and the  enemy destroyed their works, and broke down the olive trees.   \"52. Now behold, the nobleman, the lord of the vineyard, called upon  his servants, and said unto them, Why! what is the cause of this great  evil?   \"53. Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you? and after  ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and  set watchmen upon the walls thereof, built the tower also, and set a  watchman upon the tower, and watched for my "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51730"],["title","Life of David W. Patten, the First Apostolic Martyr (#4)"],["body","vineyard, and not have  fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?   \"54. And behold, the watchman upon the tower would have seen the enemy  while he was yet afar off, and then ye could have made ready and kept  the enemy from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my vineyard  from the hands of the destroyer.   \"55. And the lord of the vineyard said unto one of his servants, Go  and gather together the residue of my servants, and take all the  strength of mine house, which are my warriors, my young men, and  they that are of middle age also among all my servants, who are the  strength of mine house, save those only whom I have appointed to tarry;   \"56. And go ye straightway unto the land of my vineyard, and redeem my  vineyard, for it is mine, I have bought it with money.   \"57. Therefore, get ye straightway unto my land; break down the walls  of mine enemies; throw down their tower, and scatter their watchmen:   \"58. And inasmuch as they gather together against you, avenge me of  mine enemies, that by and by I may come with the residue of mine  house, and possess the land.   \"59. And the servant said unto his lord, When shall these things be?   \"60. And he said unto his servant, When I will, go ye straightway, and  do all things whatsoever I have commanded you;   \"61. And this shall be my seal and blessing upon you--a faithful and  wise steward in the midst of mine house, a ruler in my kingdom.   \"62. And his servant went straightway, and did all things whatsoever  his lord commanded him, and after many days all things were fulfilled.   \"63. Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto you wisdom in me  concerning all the churches, inasmuch as they are willing to be guided  in a right and proper way for their salvation,   \"64. That the work of the gathering together of my saints may  continue, that I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for  the time of harvest is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled.   \"65. Therefore, I must gather together my people, according to the  parable of the wheat and the tares, that the wheat may be secured in  the garners to possess eternal life, and be crowned with celestial  glory when I shall come in the kingdom of my Father, to reward every  man according as his work shall be,   \"66. While the tares shall be bound in bundles, and their bands made  strong, that they may be burned with an unquenchable fire.   \"67. Therefore, a commandment I give unto all the churches, that  they shall continue to gather together unto the places which I have  appointed;   \"68. Nevertheless, as I have said unto you in a former commandment,  let not your gathering be in haste, nor by flight; but let all things  be prepared before you:   \"69. And in order that all things be prepared before you, observe the  commandments which I have given concerning these things,   \"70. Which saith, or teacheth, to purchase all the lands by money,  which can be purchased for money, in the region round about the land  which I have appointed to be the land of Zion, for the beginning of  the gathering of my saints;   \"71. All the land which can be purchased in Jackson County, and the  counties round about, and leave the residue in mine hand.   \"72. Now, verily I say unto you, let all the churches gather together  all their monies; let these things be done in their time, be not in  haste, and observe to have all things prepared before you.   \"73. And let honorable men be appointed, even wise men, and send them  to purchase these lands;   \"74. And every church in the eastern countries when they are built up,  if they will hearken unto this counsel, they may buy lands and gather  together upon them, and in this way they may establish Zion.   \"75. There is even now already in store a sufficient, yea, even  abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places, no more to  be thrown down, where the churches who call themselves after my name,  willing to hearken to my voice.   \"76. And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their  enemies, it is my will that they should continue to importune for  redress, and redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as  rulers, and are in authority over you.   \"77. According to the laws and constitution of the people which I have  suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights  and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles,   \"78. That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to  futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto them,  that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of  judgement.   \"79. Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one  to another.   \"80. And for this purpose have I established the constitution of  this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very  purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.   \"81. Now, unto what shall I liken the children of Zion? I will liken  them unto the parable of the woman and the unjust judge (for men ought  always to pray and not to faint) which saith,   \"82. There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither  regarded man.   \"83. And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him,  saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.   \"84. And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within  himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow  troubleth me I will avenge her, lest, by her continual coming, she  weary me.   \"85. Thus will I liken the children of Zion.   \"86. Let them importune at the feet of the Judge;   \"87. And if he heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the  Governor;   \"88. And if the Governor heed them not, let them importune at the feet  of the President;   \"89. And if the President heed them not, then will the Lord arise and  come forth out of his hiding place, and in his fury vex the nation,   \"90. And in his hot displeasure, and in his fierce anger, in his  time, will cut off those wicked, unfaithful, and unjust stewards, and  appoint them their portion among hypocrites, and unbelievers;   \"91. Even in outer darkness, where there is weeping and wailing, and  gnashing of teeth.   \"92. Pray ye, therefore, that their ears may be opened unto your  cries, that I may be merciful unto them, that these things may not  come upon them.   \"93. What I have said unto you, must needs be, that all men may be  left without excuse;   \"94. That wise men and rulers may hear and know that which they have  never considered;   \"95. That I may proceed to bring to pass my act, my strange act, and  perform my work, my strange work, that men may discern between the  righteous and the wicked, saith your God.   \"96. And again, I say unto you, it is contrary to my commandment, and  my will, that my servant Sidney Gilbert should sell my storehouse,  which I have appointed unto my people, into the hands of mine enemies.   \"97. Let not that which I have appointed be polluted by mine enemies,  by the consent of those who call themselves after my name;   \"98. For this is a very sore and grievous sin against me, and against  my people, in consequence of those things which I have decreed and are  soon to befall the nations.   \"99. Therefore, it is my will that my people should claim, and hold  claim upon that which I have appointed unto them, though they should  not be permitted to dwell thereon;   \"100. Nevertheless, I do not say they shall not dwell thereon; for  inasmuch as they bring forth fruit and works meet for my kingdom, they  shall dwell thereon;   \"101. They shall build, and another shall not inherit it; they shall  plant vineyards, and they shall eat the fruit thereof. Even so.  Amen.\"--Doc. and Cov. Sec. 101.  With a copy of this revelation and other papers bearing comfort to the distressed people, David accompanied William D. Pratt to Missouri, making the greater part of the journey on foot.  Under date of December 19th occurs the following entry in the diary of the Prophet Joseph Smith:  \"William Pratt and David Patten took their journey to the land of Zion, for the purpose of beating dispatches to the brethren in that place from Kirtland. O, may God grant it a blessing for Zion, as a kind angel from heaven. Amen.\"  To face that journey of six hundred miles in the dead of winter on foot and in poverty, took no common courage. Men who weighed their own comfort against the welfare of their fellowmen, would have seriously considered the alternative. But not so with these.  Since the summer of 1831, when the Saints first settled in Jackson County, Missouri, converts had been gathering from all parts of the country to the center Stake of Zion. Much progress had been made by them in providing themselves with the comforts of life, when, in the fall of 1833, an armed mob recruited from the surrounding region arose against the Saints and drove them, about twelve hundred souls in all, from their homes, and now they were as we have seen scattered and in distress.  After much suffering on this perilous journey, David reached Clay County, where his brother John had located, on March 24, 1834. He found the Saints in a truly pitiable condition. Driven from their homes in and about Independence before the crops of the previous year could be utilized, their fields laid waste, their houses and in many instances all their belongings burned by the mob, many of the people hardly knew how they had been preserved through the winter. The Lord only will ever know.  David's whole soul went out to the sufferers. His time was spent night and day in ministering to their necessities. That attribute of the Lord, which we are sent here particularly to cultivate, of love for all things, was most fully exercised in David during this period of his development. Even the most despised of the animal kingdom came within the reach of his sympathy, for while traveling among the people he interposed whenever opportunity offered to prevent the"]]]
