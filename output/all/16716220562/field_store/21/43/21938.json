Then he found, sitting familiarly in the circle of lovely immortals, a broad-shouldered, stalwart youth, who, when erect, stood fully as high as the shoulder of the Master himself.  Ak paused, silent and frowning, to bend his piercing gaze upon Claus. The clear eyes met his own steadfastly, and the Woodsman gave a sigh of relief as he marked their placid depths and read the youth's brave and innocent heart.  Nevertheless, as Ak sat beside the fair Queen, and the golden chalice, filled with rare nectar, passed from lip to lip, the Master Woodsman was strangely silent and reserved, and stroked his beard many times with a thoughtful motion.  With morning he called Claus aside, in kindly fashion, saying:  \"Bid good by, for a time, to Necile and her sisters; for you shall accompany me on my journey through the world.\"  The venture pleased Claus, who knew well the honor of being companion of the Master Woodsman of the world.  But Necile wept for the first time in her life, and clung to the boy's neck as if she could not bear to let him go.  The nymph who had mothered this sturdy youth was still as dainty, as charming and beautiful as when she had dared to face Ak with the babe clasped to her breast; nor was her love less great.  Ak beheld the two clinging together, seemingly as brother and sister to one another, and again he wore his thoughtful look.    6.  Claus Discovers Humanity  Taking Claus to a small clearing in the forest, the Master said: \"Place your hand upon my girdle and hold fast while we journey through the air; for now shall we encircle the world and look upon many of the haunts of those men from whom you are descended.\"  These words caused Claus to marvel, for until now he had thought himself the only one of his kind upon the earth; yet in silence he grasped firmly the girdle of the great Ak, his astonishment forbidding speech.  Then the vast forest of Burzee seemed to fall away from their feet, and the youth found himself passing swiftly through the air at a great height.  Ere long there were spires beneath them, while buildings of many shapes and colors met their downward view.  It was a city of men, and Ak, pausing to descend, led Claus to its inclosure.  Said the Master:  \"So long as you hold fast to my girdle you will remain unseen by all mankind, though seeing clearly yourself.  To release your grasp will be to separate yourself forever from me and your home in Burzee.\"  One of the first laws of the Forest is obedience, and Claus had no thought of disobeying the Master's wish.  He clung fast to the girdle and remained invisible.  Thereafter with each moment passed in the city the youth's wonder grew. He, who had supposed himself created differently from all others, now found the earth swarming with creatures of his own kind.  \"Indeed,\" said Ak, \"the immortals are few; but the mortals are many.\"  Claus looked earnestly upon his fellows.  There were sad faces, gay and reckless faces, pleasant faces, anxious faces and kindly faces, all mingled in puzzling disorder.  Some worked at tedious tasks; some strutted in impudent conceit; some were thoughtful and grave while others seemed happy and content.  Men of many natures were there, as everywhere, and Claus found much to please him and much to make him sad.  But especially he noted the children--first curiously, then eagerly, then lovingly.  Ragged little ones rolled in the dust of the streets, playing with scraps and pebbles.  Other children, gaily dressed, were propped upon cushions and fed with sugar-plums.  Yet the children of the rich were not happier than those playing with the dust and pebbles, it seemed to Claus.  \"Childhood is the time of man's greatest content,\" said Ak, following the youth's thoughts.  \"'Tis during these years of innocent pleasure that the little ones are most free from care.\"  \"Tell me,\" said Claus, \"why do not all these babies fare alike?\"  \"Because they are born in both cottage and palace,\" returned the Master.  \"The difference in the wealth of the parents determines the lot of the child.  Some are carefully tended and clothed in silks and dainty linen; others are neglected and covered with rags.\"  \"Yet all seem equally fair and sweet,\" said Claus, thoughtfully.  \"While they are babes--yes;\" agreed Ak.  \"Their joy is in being alive, and they do not stop to think.  In after years the doom of mankind overtakes them, and they find they must struggle and worry, work and fret, to gain the wealth that is so dear to the hearts of men.  Such things are unknown in the Forest where you were reared.\"  Claus was silent a moment.  Then he asked:  \"Why was I reared in the forest, among those who are not of my race?\"  Then Ak, in gentle voice, told him the story of his babyhood: how he had been abandoned at the forest's edge and left a prey to wild beasts, and how the loving nymph Necile had rescued him and brought him to manhood under the protection of the immortals.  \"Yet I am not of them,\" said Claus, musingly.  \"You are not of them,\" returned the Woodsman.  \"The nymph who cared for you as a mother seems now like a sister to you; by and by, when you grow old and gray, she will seem like a daughter.  Yet another brief span and you will be but a memory, while she remains Necile.\"  \"Then why, if man must perish, is he born?\" demanded the boy.  \"Everything perishes except the world itself and its keepers,\" answered Ak.  \"But while life lasts everything on earth has its use.  The wise seek ways to be helpful to the world, for the helpful ones are sure to live again.\"  Much of this Claus failed to understand fully, but a longing seized him to become helpful to his fellows, and he remained grave and thoughtful while they resumed their journey.  They visited many dwellings of men in many parts of the world, watching farmers toil in the fields, warriors dash into cruel fray, and merchants exchange their goods for bits of white and yellow metal.  And everywhere the eyes of Claus sought out the children in love and pity, for the thought of his own helpless babyhood was strong within him and he yearned to give help to the innocent little ones of his race even as he had been succored by the kindly nymph.  Day by day the Master Woodsman and his pupil traversed the earth, Ak speaking but seldom to the youth who clung steadfastly to his girdle, but guiding him into all places where he might become familiar with the lives of human beings.  And at last they returned to the grand old Forest of Burzee, where the Master set Claus down within the circle of nymphs, among whom the pretty Necile anxiously awaited him.  The brow of the great Ak was now calm and peaceful; but the brow of Claus had become lined with deep thought.  Necile sighed at the change in her foster-son, who until now had been ever joyous and smiling, and the thought came to her that never again would the life of the boy be the same as before this eventful journey with the Master.    7.  Claus Leaves the Forest  When good Queen Zurline had touched the golden chalice with her fair lips and it had passed around the circle in honor of the travelers' return, the Master Woodsman of the World, who had not yet spoken, turned his gaze frankly upon Claus and said:  \"Well?\"  The boy understood, and rose slowly to his feet beside Necile.  Once only his eyes passed around the familiar circle of nymphs, every one of whom he remembered as a loving comrade; but tears came unbidden to dim his sight, so he gazed thereafter steadfastly at the Master.  \"I have been ignorant,\" said he, simply, \"until the great Ak in his kindness taught me who and what I am.  You, who live so sweetly in your forest bowers, ever fair and youthful and innocent, are no fit comrades for a son of humanity.  For I have looked upon man, finding him doomed to live for a brief space upon earth, to toil for the things he needs, to fade into old age, and then to pass away as the leaves in autumn. Yet every man has his mission, which is to leave the world better, in some way, than he found it.  I am of the race of men, and man's lot is my lot.  For your tender care of the poor, forsaken babe you adopted, as well as for your loving comradeship during my boyhood, my heart will ever overflow with gratitude.  My foster-mother,\" here he stopped and kissed Necile's white forehead, \"I shall love and cherish while life lasts.  But I must leave you, to take my part in the endless struggle to which humanity is doomed, and to live my life in my own way.\"  \"What will you do?\" asked the Queen, gravely.  \"I must devote myself to the care of the children of mankind, and try to make them happy,\" he answered.  \"Since your own tender care of a babe brought to me happiness and strength, it is just and right that I devote my life to the pleasure of other babes.  Thus will the memory of the loving nymph Necile be planted within the hearts of thousands of my race for many years to come, and her kindly act be recounted in song and in story while the world shall last.  Have I spoken well, O Master?\"  \"You have spoken well,\" returned Ak, and rising to his feet he continued: \"Yet one thing must not be forgotten.  Having been adopted as the child of the Forest, and the playfellow of the nymphs, you have gained a distinction which forever separates you from your kind. Therefore, when you go forth into the world of men you shall retain the protection of the Forest, and the powers you now enjoy will remain with you to assist you in your labors.  In any need you may call upon the Nymphs, the Ryls, the Knooks and the Fairies, and they will serve you gladly.  I, the Master Woodsman of the World, have said it, and my Word is the Law!\"  Claus looked upon Ak with grateful eyes.  \"This will make me mighty among men,\" he replied.  \"Protected by these kind friends I may be able to make thousands of little children happy. I will try very hard to do my duty, and I know the Forest people will give me their sympathy and help.\"  \"We will!\" said the Fairy Queen,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],["title","The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#3)"],["body","ly.  \"We will!\" cried the merry Ryls, laughing.  \"We will!\" shouted the crooked Knooks, scowling.  \"We will!\" exclaimed the sweet nymphs, proudly.  But Necile said nothing.  She only folded Claus in her arms and kissed him tenderly.  \"The world is big,\" continued the boy, turning again to his loyal friends, \"but men are everywhere.  I shall begin my work near my friends, so that if I meet with misfortune I can come to the Forest for counsel or help.\"  With that he gave them all a loving look and turned away.  There was no need to say good by, by for him the sweet, wild life of the Forest was over.  He went forth bravely to meet his doom--the doom of the race of man--the necessity to worry and work.  But Ak, who knew the boy's heart, was merciful and guided his steps.   Coming through Burzee to its eastern edge Claus reached the Laughing Valley of Hohaho.  On each side were rolling green hills, and a brook wandered midway between them to wind afar off beyond the valley.  At his back was the grim Forest; at the far end of the valley a broad plain.  The eyes of the young man, which had until now reflected his grave thoughts, became brighter as he stood silent, looking out upon the Laughing Valley.  Then on a sudden his eyes twinkled, as stars do on a still night, and grew merry and wide.  For at his feet the cowslips and daisies smiled on him in friendly regard; the breeze whistled gaily as it passed by and fluttered the locks on his forehead; the brook laughed joyously as it leaped over the pebbles and swept around the green curves of its banks; the bees sang sweet songs as they flew from dandelion to daffodil; the beetles chirruped happily in the long grass, and the sunbeams glinted pleasantly over all the scene.  \"Here,\" cried Claus, stretching out his arms as if to embrace the Valley, \"will I make my home!\"  That was many, many years ago.  It has been his home ever since.  It is his home now.     MANHOOD    1.  The Laughing Valley  When Claus came the Valley was empty save for the grass, the brook, the wildflowers, the bees and the butterflies.  If he would make his home here and live after the fashion of men he must have a house.  This puzzled him at first, but while he stood smiling in the sunshine he suddenly found beside him old Nelko, the servant of the Master Woodsman.  Nelko bore an ax, strong and broad, with blade that gleamed like burnished silver.  This he placed in the young man's hand, then disappeared without a word.  Claus understood, and turning to the Forest's edge he selected a number of fallen tree-trunks, which he began to clear of their dead branches. He would not cut into a living tree.  His life among the nymphs who guarded the Forest had taught him that a live tree is sacred, being a created thing endowed with feeling.  But with the dead and fallen trees it was different.  They had fulfilled their destiny, as active members of the Forest community, and now it was fitting that their remains should minister to the needs of man.  The ax bit deep into the logs at every stroke.  It seemed to have a force of its own, and Claus had but to swing and guide it.  When shadows began creeping over the green hills to lie in the Valley overnight, the young man had chopped many logs into equal lengths and proper shapes for building a house such as he had seen the poorer classes of men inhabit.  Then, resolving to await another day before he tried to fit the logs together, Claus ate some of the sweet roots he well knew how to find, drank deeply from the laughing brook, and lay down to sleep on the grass, first seeking a spot where no flowers grew, lest the weight of his body should crush them.  And while he slumbered and breathed in the perfume of the wondrous Valley the Spirit of Happiness crept into his heart and drove out all terror and care and misgivings.  Never more would the face of Claus be clouded with anxieties; never more would the trials of life weigh him down as with a burden.  The Laughing Valley had claimed him for its own.  Would that we all might live in that delightful place!--but then, maybe, it would become overcrowded.  For ages it had awaited a tenant. Was it chance that led young Claus to make his home in this happy vale? Or may we guess that his thoughtful friends, the immortals, had directed his steps when he wandered away from Burzee to seek a home in the great world?  Certain it is that while the moon peered over the hilltop and flooded with its soft beams the body of the sleeping stranger, the Laughing Valley was filled with the queer, crooked shapes of the friendly Knooks.  These people spoke no words, but worked with skill and swiftness.  The logs Claus had trimmed with his bright ax were carried to a spot beside the brook and fitted one upon another, and during the night a strong and roomy dwelling was built.  The birds came sweeping into the Valley at daybreak, and their songs, so seldom heard in the deep wood, aroused the stranger.  He rubbed the web of sleep from his eyelids and looked around.  The house met his gaze.  \"I must thank the Knooks for this,\" said he, gratefully.  Then he walked to his dwelling and entered at the doorway.  A large room faced him, having a fireplace at the end and a table and bench in the middle. Beside the fireplace was a cupboard.  Another doorway was beyond. Claus entered here, also, and saw a smaller room with a bed against the wall and a stool set near a small stand.  On the bed were many layers of dried moss brought from the Forest.  \"Indeed, it is a palace!\" exclaimed the smiling Claus.  \"I must thank the good Knooks again, for their knowledge of man's needs as well as for their labors in my behalf.\"  He left his new home with a glad feeling that he was not quite alone in the world, although he had chosen to abandon his Forest life. Friendships are not easily broken, and the immortals are everywhere.  Upon reaching the brook he drank of the pure water, and then sat down on the bank to laugh at the mischievous gambols of the ripples as they pushed one another against rocks or crowded desperately to see which should first reach the turn beyond.  And as they raced away he listened to the song they sang:    \"Rushing, pushing, on we go!   Not a wave may gently flow--     All are too excited.     Ev'ry drop, delighted,   Turns to spray in merry play   As we tumble on our way!\"   Next Claus searched for roots to eat, while the daffodils turned their little eyes up to him laughingly and lisped their dainty song:    \"Blooming fairly, growing rarely,     Never flowerets were so gay!   Perfume breathing, joy bequeathing,     As our colors we display.\"   It made Claus laugh to hear the little things voice their happiness as they nodded gracefully on their stems.  But another strain caught his ear as the sunbeams fell gently across his face and whispered:    \"Here is gladness, that our rays     Warm the valley through the days;   Here is happiness, to give     Comfort unto all who live!\"   \"Yes!\" cried Claus in answer, \"there is happiness and joy in all things here.  The Laughing Valley is a valley of peace and good-will.\"  He passed the day talking with the ants and beetles and exchanging jokes with the light-hearted butterflies.  And at night he lay on his bed of soft moss and slept soundly.  Then came the Fairies, merry but noiseless, bringing skillets and pots and dishes and pans and all the tools necessary to prepare food and to comfort a mortal.  With these they filled cupboard and fireplace, finally placing a stout suit of wool clothing on the stool by the bedside.  When Claus awoke he rubbed his eyes again, and laughed, and spoke aloud his thanks to the Fairies and the Master Woodsman who had sent them. With eager joy he examined all his new possessions, wondering what some might be used for.  But, in the days when he had clung to the girdle of the great Ak and visited the cities of men, his eyes had been quick to note all the manners and customs of the race to which he belonged; so he guessed from the gifts brought by the Fairies that the Master expected him hereafter to live in the fashion of his fellow-creatures.  \"Which means that I must plow the earth and plant corn,\" he reflected; \"so that when winter comes I shall have garnered food in plenty.\"  But, as he stood in the grassy Valley, he saw that to turn up the earth in furrows would be to destroy hundreds of pretty, helpless flowers, as well as thousands of the tender blades of grass.  And this he could not bear to do.  Therefore he stretched out his arms and uttered a peculiar whistle he had learned in the Forest, afterward crying:  \"Ryls of the Field Flowers--come to me!\"  Instantly a dozen of the queer little Ryls were squatting upon the ground before him, and they nodded to him in cheerful greeting.  Claus gazed upon them earnestly.  \"Your brothers of the Forest,\" he said, \"I have known and loved many years.  I shall love you, also, when we have become friends.  To me the laws of the Ryls, whether those of the Forest or of the field, are sacred.  I have never wilfully destroyed one of the flowers you tend so carefully; but I must plant grain to use for food during the cold winter, and how am I to do this without killing the little creatures that sing to me so prettily of their fragrant blossoms?\"  The Yellow Ryl, he who tends the buttercups, made answer:  \"Fret not, friend Claus.  The great Ak has spoken to us of you.  There is better work for you in life than to labor for food, and though, not being of the Forest, Ak has no command over us, nevertheless are we glad to favor one he loves.  Live, therefore, to do the good work you are resolved to undertake.  We, the Field Ryls, will attend to your food supplies.\"  After this speech the Ryls were no longer to be seen, and Claus drove from his mind the thought of tilling the earth.  When next he wandered back to his dwelling a bowl of fresh milk stood upon the table; bread was in the cupboard and sweet honey filled a dish beside"]]]
