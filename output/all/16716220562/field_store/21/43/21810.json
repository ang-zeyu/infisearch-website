Can't he produce the other papers as well?\"  \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I guess so. But it will cost us.\"  \"I'm sure we can find a way to pay,\" Foster said. \"Will you see him--early in the morning?\"  I looked around the blowsy room. Hot night air stirred a geranium wilting in a tin can on the window sill. An odor of bad cooking and worse plumbing floated up from the street.  \"At least,\" I said, \"it would mean getting out of here.\"     CHAPTER V   It was almost sundown when Foster and I pushed through the door to the saloon bar at the Ancient Sinner and found a corner table. I watched Foster spread out his maps and papers. Behind us there was a murmur of conversation and the thump of darts against a board.  \"When are you going to give up and admit we're wasting our time?\" I said. \"Two weeks of tramping over the same ground, and we end up in the same place.\"  \"We've hardly begun our investigation,\" Foster said mildly.  \"You keep saying that,\" I said. \"But if there ever was anything in that rock-pile, it's long gone. The archaeologists have been digging over the site for years, and they haven't come up with anything.\"  \"They don't know what to look for,\" Foster said. \"They were searching for indications of religious significance, human sacrifice--that sort of thing.\"  \"We don't know what we're looking for either,\" I said. \"Unless you think maybe we'll meet the Hunters hiding under a loose stone.\"  \"You say that sardonically,\" Foster said. \"But I don't consider it impossible.\"  \"I know,\" I said. \"You've convinced yourself that the Hunters were after us back at Mayport when we ran off like a pair of idiots.\"  \"From what you've told me of the circumstances--\" Foster began.  \"I know; you don't consider it impossible. That's the trouble with you; you don't consider anything impossible. It would make life a lot easier for me if you'd let me rule out a few items--like leprechauns who hang out at Stonehenge.\"  Foster looked at me, half-smiling. It had only been a few weeks since he woke up from a nap looking like a senior class president who hadn't made up his mind whether to be a preacher or a movie star, but he had already lost that mild, innocent air. He learned fast, and day by day I had seen his old personality reemerge and--in spite of my attempts to hold onto the ascendency--dominate our partnership.  \"It's a failing of your culture,\" Foster said, \"that hypothesis becomes dogma almost overnight. You're too close to your Neolithic, when the blind acceptance of tribal lore had survival value. Having learned to evoke the fire god from sticks, by rote, you tend to extend the principle to all 'established facts.'\"  \"Here's an established fact for you,\" I said. \"We've got fifteen pounds left--that's about forty dollars. It's time we figure out where to go from here, before somebody starts checking up on those phoney papers of ours.\"  Foster shook his head. \"I'm not satisfied that we've exhausted the possibilities here. I've been studying the geometric relationships between the various structures; I have some ideas I want to check. I think it might be a good idea to go out at night, when we can work without the usual crowd of tourists observing every move.\"  I groaned. \"My dogs are killing me,\" I said. \"Let's hope you'll come up with something better--or at least different.\"  \"We'll have a bite to eat here, and wait until dark to start out,\" Foster said.  The publican brought us plates of cold meat and potato salad. I worked on a thin but durable slice of ham and thought about all the people, somewhere, who were sitting down now to gracious meals in the glitter of crystal and silver. I'd had too many greasy French fries in too many cheap dives the last few years. I could feel them all now, burning in my stomach. I was getting farther from my island all the time--And it was nobody's fault but mine.  \"The Ancient Sinner,\" I said. \"That's me.\"  Foster looked up. \"Curious names these old pubs have,\" he said. \"I suppose in some cases the origins are lost in antiquity.\"  \"Why don't they think up something cheery,\" I said. \"Like 'The Paradise Bar and Grill' or 'The Happy Hour Cafe'. Did you notice the sign hanging outside?\"  \"No.\"  \"A picture of a skeleton. He's holding one hand up like a Yankee evangelist prophesying doom. You can see it through the window there.\"  Foster turned and looked out at the weathered sign creaking in the evening wind. He looked at it for a long time. When he turned back, there was a strange look around his eyes.  \"What's the matter--?\" I started.  Foster ignored me, waved to the proprietor, a short fat country man. He came over to the table, wiping his hands on his apron.  \"A very interesting old building,\" Foster said. \"We've been admiring it. When was it built?\"  \"Well, sir,\" the publican said, \"This here house is a many a hundred year old. It were built by the monks, they say, from the monastery what used to stand nearby here. It were tore down by the King's men, Henry, that was, what time he drove the papists out.\"  \"That would be Henry the Eighth, I suppose?\"  \"Aye, it would that. And this house is all that were spared, it being the brewing-house, as the king said were a worthwhile institution, and he laid on a tithe, that two kegs of stout was to be laid by for the king's use each brewing time.\"  \"Very interesting,\" Foster said. \"Is the custom still continued?\"  The publican shook his head. \"It were ended in my granfer's time, it being that the Queen were a teetotaller.\"  \"How did it acquire the curious name--'The Ancient Sinner?'\"  \"The tale is,\" the publican said, \"that one day a lay brother of the order were digging about yonder on the plain by the great stones, in search of the Druid's treasure, albeit the Abbot had forbid him to go nigh the heathen ground, and he come on the bones of a man, and being of a kindly turn, he had the thought to give them Christian burial. Now, knowing the Abbott would nae permit it, he set to work to dig a grave by moonlight in holy ground, under the monastery walls. But the Abbott, being wakeful, were abroad and come on the brother a-digging, and when he asked the why of it, the lay brother having visions of penances to burden him for many a day, he ups and tells the Abbott it were a ale cellar he were about digging, and the Abbott, not being without wisdom, clapped him on the back, and went on his way. And so it was the ale-house got built, and blessed by the Abbott, and with it the bones that was laid away under the floor beneath the ale-casks.\"  \"So the ancient sinner is buried under the floor?\"  \"Aye, so the tale goes, though I've not dug for him meself. But the house has been knowed by the name these four hundred years.\"  \"Where was it you said the lay brother was digging?\"  \"On the plain, yonder, by the Druid's stones, what they call Stonehenge,\" the publican said. He picked up the empty glasses. \"What about another, gentlemen?\"  \"Certainly,\" Foster said. He sat quietly across from me, his features composed--but I could see there was tension under the surface calm.  \"What's this all about?\" I asked softly. \"When did you get so interested in local history?\"  \"Later,\" Foster murmured. \"Keep looking bored.\"  \"That'll be easy,\" I said. The publican came back and placed heavy glass mugs before us.  \"You were telling us about the lay brother's finding the bones,\" Foster said. \"You say they were buried in Stonehenge?\"  The publican cleared his throat, glanced sideways at Foster.  \"The gentlemen wouldna be from the University now, I suppose?\" he said.  \"Let's just say,\" Foster said easily, smiling, \"that we have a great interest in these bits of lore--an interest supported by modest funds, of course.\"  The publican made a show of wiping at the rings on the table top.  \"A costly business, I wager,\" he said. \"Digging about in odd places and all. Now, knowing where to dig; that's important, I'll be bound.\"  \"Very important,\" Foster said. \"Worth five pounds, easily.\"  \"'Twere my granfer told me of the spot; took me out by moonlight, he did, and showed me where his granfer had showed him. Told me it were a fine great secret, the likes of which a simple man could well take pride in.\"  \"And an additional five pounds as a token of my personal esteem,\" Foster said.  The publican eyed me. \"Well, a secret as was handed down father to son....\"  \"And, of course, my associate wishes to express his esteem, too,\" Foster said. \"Another five pounds worth.\"  \"That's all the esteem the budget will bear, Mr. Foster,\" I said. I got out the fifteen pounds and passed the money across to him. \"I hope you haven't forgotten those people back home who wanted to talk to us,\" I said. \"They'll be getting in touch with us any time now, I'll bet.\"  Foster rolled up the bills and held them in his hand. \"That's true, Mr. Legion,\" he said. \"Perhaps we shouldn't take the time....\"  \"But being it's for the advancement of science,\" the publican said, \"I'm willing to make the sacrifice.\"  \"We'll want to go out tonight,\" Foster said. \"We have a very tight schedule.\"  The landlord dickered with Foster for another five minutes before he agreed to guide us to the spot where the skeleton had been found.  When he left, I began. \"Now tell me.\"  \"Look at the signboard again,\" Foster said. I looked. The skull smiled, holding up a hand.  \"I see it,\" I said. \"But it doesn't explain why you handed over our last buck----\"  \"Look at the hand. Look at the ring on the finger.\"  I looked again. A heavy ring was painted on the bony index finger, with a pattern of concentric circles.  It was a duplicate of the one on Foster's finger.         *       *       *       *       *  The publican pulled the battered Morris Minor to the side of the highway and set the brake.  \"This is as close as we best take the machine,\" he said.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                 The man I searched for could be anybody at all.             If I didn't find him, there'd be nobody at all.   One more city. The pattern went on. One more city to search for a man I did not know, whose face I would not recognize. I had no copy of either his fingerprints or encephalograph, or any other clue to his identity.  Yet he had to be found.  At one time he had been my best friend. His name was Howard Zealley then. He wouldn't be using the same name now.  And the \"bug\" in his brain would by this time have made him a stranger.  There was only one way the job could be done: I had to make contact--even though I might not be aware of it at the time--reveal who I was, and hope he'd come out after me.  I rented a room in a cheap hotel. But not so cheap that it wouldn't have a grid connection with information service.  I wrote my name big on the register: MAX CALOF. There was always the chance that he would see it. He would remember the name.  The room was small, a standard \"living-in\" cubicle. Which was all right. I didn't intend to sleep here. I hadn't slept in nine years now--a year before the chase began. I kicked off my saddle shoes and walked on stockinged feet to the vid coin slot and dropped in a half dollar.  The screen flickered once and the face of a beautiful, smiling woman came into focus. \"May I help you, sir?\" she asked in a pleasant, very friendly voice.  I realized that the woman was not actually speaking, as she appeared to be doing. She was merely a woman image, with her voice and facial expressions synchronized in some way with the word impulses coming from information central.         *       *       *       *       *  I stretched out on the bed, folding the pillow under my head to have an unobstructed view of the screen. \"Give me the names of the city's two hundred most prominent male citizens,\" I said.  There was no sign of surprise on the woman face, but I got the usual expressive long pause from central. The request was unusual. Central relays always had trouble with the proper definition of \"prominent.\"  \"Any particular category?\" the woman image finally asked.  \"All categories,\" I answered.  Another pause. Even a mechanical brain would take a bit of time to assemble that information, but get it I would.  After a while the woman began. \"Edward Anderson. Russell Baker. Joseph Dillon. Francis....\" As her gently modulated voice went on, I closed my eyes, keeping my mind blank, letting each name pass without resistance through my consciousness. Sometimes a hunch came that way. There was no need to make a written list. I had total recall.  I became aware that I had opened my shirt collar and that I was perspiring. I hadn't noticed how hot the day was or that the room had no air conditioning. I took a minute to concentrate. The perspiration dried and my body adjusted itself to the room's temperature and humidity. When I was comfortable again, I returned my attention to the woman's voice.  At the end of the reading, no name had stayed with me. I opened my eyes. \"Eliminate all except those within the age range of twenty to forty,\" I said. Zealley would be thirty-seven by now--but probably appear younger. \"Got that?\"  \"Yes sir.\"  \"How many left?\" I asked.  \"Sixty-four.\"  It was always a temptation to cut the list further. I was weary of the seemingly endless repetition of the same routine and the frustrating lack of any results. Eight years is a long time to search for a man. Yet I could not afford to be careless. I was gambling everything on my having figured out the way Zealley's mind operated, how he would act, where he would hide. When the woman finished speaking, I walked to the vid and switched it off.  I noted by the wall clock that it was almost noon. I hadn't had breakfast yet. In the back of my mind, as I ordered a meal, was the certainty that someday this appetite too would grow sated and dull. There were so few satisfactions left....         *       *       *       *       *  The first name on my list was Edward Anderson. The city's mayor. It took me two hours to get into his office, and two minutes to be on my way out again. I had asked my questions and met the usual blank response.  On the street I spent another hour strolling through the shopping district. No shadower picked me up.  Which pretty well eliminated Anderson--or anyone in close contact with him.  Second name, Russell Baker. Industrialist. Minneapolis Mining & Allied Products.  I got as far as his secretary, John Roesler.  \"What can I do for you?\" Roesler asked. He was a big-boned, handsome man, with an air of sleepy indolence. He cleaned and trimmed his fingernails with a small gold penknife.  \"I'd like to see Mr. Baker,\" I said.  \"What about?\"  \"Confidential business.\"  \"No one gets in to see a man like Mr. Baker that easy. If they could, he'd be pestered by every crackpot in town.\"  This was as far as I was going to get. I had to make the best of it. \"Will you give him a message then?\" I asked.  Roesler shrugged. \"If I think he should have it.\"  \"I would advise you to deliver it,\" I said making my tone as impressive as possible. \"If he doesn't get it, you may be out of a job.\"  His eyebrows raised slightly.  \"Tell him,\" I said, \"that Max Calof wants to see him,\" and spelled my last name for him.  \"And what should I say you want to see him about?\" I had caught a slight break in Roesler's composure.  \"About a mutual friend--Howard Zealley,\" I replied. \"I think he'll be interested.\"  Roesler hid a yawn behind a well-manicured hand. \"We'll see,\" he said, and I went back out.  Twice within ten minutes I observed the same pale-faced youth trailing me, and my pulse gave a great racing bound. This could be it.  I stopped and studied the men's hats in a shop window. From the side of my eye I saw the youth stop also. He leaned against a traffic light stanchion and kicked idly at a scrap of paper on the sidewalk.  I wandered through a department store, stopping to purchase a toothbrush and a handkerchief, and he followed, keeping always a discreet distance behind. My last doubt was removed. I returned to my hotel. With luck, the hunter would now become the hunted.  In my room I pulled a grip from under the bed and took out a rubber-handled screwdriver and a pair of pliers, a pocket knife, several lengths of copper wire, and a small instrument in a black case about the size of my fist. Climbing on a straight-back chair, I removed the frosted globe from the room's center light. I bared the wires, carefully spliced on two pieces of wire, connected the black box, and replaced the globe.  I had a little more trouble with the electrical clock's wiring, but at the end I was satisfied. The time was two-fifteen. I made my setting for three o'clock. Zealley should be here before then. If not, I could always set the timing back.  There was nothing to do now except wait.         *       *       *       *       *  Nearly a half hour passed from the time I finished my preparations, and I was beginning to think Zealley would be late, when the door of my compartment was kicked savagely open.  The man who followed the kick was lean and dark, with wavy brown hair combed meticulously into place. A bent nose dispelled any illusion of softness.  I was disappointed. If this was Zealley, it was not at all the way I had expected him to look. I had thought he would be more polished perhaps, more intelligent, with more of the outward signs of success.  This weighing I did with a fleeting glance, and passed to the two men who followed my first visitor: Roesler and the pale-faced youth. Roesler was wearing a yellow hat.  I swung my legs over the side of the bed where I had been lying and sat up. \"Come in,\" I said.  The sarcasm was not wasted on Roesler. He kept his gaze on me, but spoke to the two men with him. \"Stay by the door, George,\" he ordered the boy. \"You, Steve,\" he addressed the lean man, \"get on the other side of him. Stay close.\" He let himself ease into the lounge chair behind him.  I decided to stir things up a bit. \"I see you brought a boy,\" I said, nodding at the one by the door. \"This might turn out to be a man's job.\"  Roesler glanced aside at the youth, whose lips pulled away from his teeth and eyes filled with quick hate. He pulled a switch-blade knife from his pocket and snapped it open.  I found myself making a swift reappraisal. The lad was not the simple hood type I had first judged him to be. There was a flat look about the wide whites of his eyes that warned of something apart from courage.  \"Not yet, George,\" Roesler said, and his voice, though almost gentle, stopped the boy before he took a step.  Roesler pulled his penknife from a coat pocket and began trimming his nails.  \"Someday you're going to run out of fingernails,\" I said.  Roesler laughed soundlessly, amused.  I glanced unobtrusively at the clock. Ten minutes to three. Time passed slowly in a situation like this.  Roesler regarded me speculatively. \"You don't seem very nervous,\" he said.  \"Should I be?\"  \"I would think so,\" he said. \"If I were in your position, I think I'd be nervous.\"  \"Would you?\"  \"Take off your clothes,\" he said, with no change of tone.  I took in a long breath and began opening my shirt. Another glance at the clock told me I needed at least eight more minutes. I had to stall.         *       *       *       *       *  Roesler made no attempt to hurry me. He was a man certain of his control of the situation.  I kicked off my shorts, the last of my clothes, and for the first time felt ill at ease. Standing stripped to the raw before these men put me at a mental disadvantage. I feared them only to the point of discretion, but I had lost a"]]]
