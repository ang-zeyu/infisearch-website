She looked up and shook her head.  \"It belongs to somebody else. If it fixes a libido attachment on you, you're actually robbing its owner. They can't love many people at once.\"  She snorted, but installed the thing in its cage.  \"Anne--\" Norris hesitated, hating to approach the subject. \"Do you--want one--for yourself? I can sign an unclaimed one over to you to keep in the house. It won't cost us anything.\"  Slowly she shook her head, and her pale eyes went moody and luminous. \"I'm going to have one of my own,\" she said.  He stood in the back of the truck, staring down at her. \"Do you realize what--\"  \"I know what I'm saying. We're class-C on account of heart-trouble in both our families. Well, I don't care, Terry. I'm not going to waste a heart over one of these pathetic little artificial animals. We're going to have a baby.\"  \"You know what they'd do to us?\"  \"If they catch us, yes--compulsory divorce, sterilization. But they won't catch us. I'll have it at home, Terry. Not even a doctor. We'll hide it.\"  \"I won't let you do such a thing.\"  She faced him angrily. \"Oh, this whole rotten _world_!\" she choked. Suddenly she turned and fled out of the building. She was sobbing.         *       *       *       *       *  Norris climbed slowly down from the truck and wandered on into the house. She was not in the kitchen nor the living room. The bedroom door was locked. He shrugged and went to sit on the sofa. The television set was on, and a newscast was coming from a local station.  \"... we were unable to get shots of the body,\" the announcer was saying. \"But here is a view of the Georges residence. I'll switch you to our mobile unit in Sherman II, James Duncan reporting.\"  Norris frowned with bewilderment as the scene shifted to a two-story plasticoid house among the elm trees. It was after dark, but the mobile unit's powerful floodlights made daylight of the house and its yard and the police 'copters sitting in a side lot. An ambulance was parked in the street. A new voice came on the audio.  \"This is James Duncan, ladies and gentlemen, speaking to you from our mobile unit in front of the late Doctor Hiram Georges' residence just west of Sherman II. We are waiting for the stretcher to be brought out, and Police Chief Erskine Miler is standing here beside me to give us a word about the case. Doctor Georges' death has shocked the community deeply. Most of you local listeners have known him for many years--some of you have depended upon his services as a family physician. He was a man well known, well loved. But now let's listen to Chief Miler.\"  Norris sat breathing quickly. There could scarcely be two Doctor Georges in the community, but only this morning....  A growling drawl came from the audio. \"This's Chief Miler speaking, folks. I just want to say that if any of you know the whereabouts of a Mrs. Sarah Glubbes, call me immediately. She's wanted for questioning.\"  \"Thank you, Chief. This is James Duncan again. I'll review the facts for you briefly again, ladies and gentlemen. At seven o'clock, less than an hour ago, a woman--allegedly Mrs. Glubbes--burst into Doctor Georges' dining room while the family was at dinner. She was brandishing a pistol and screaming, 'You stole my baby! You gave me the wrong baby! Where's my baby?'  \"When the doctor assured her that there was no other baby, she fired, shattering his salad plate. Glancing off it, the bullet pierced his heart. The woman fled. A peculiar feature of the case is that Mrs. Glubbes, the alleged intruder, _has no baby_. Just a minute--just a minute--here comes the stretcher now.\"  Norris turned the set off and went to call the police. He told them what he knew and promised to make himself available for questioning if it became necessary. When he turned from the phone, Anne was standing in the bedroom doorway. She might have been crying a little, but she concealed it well.  \"What was all that?\" she asked.  \"Woman killed a man. I happened to know the motive.\"  \"What was it?\"  \"Neutroid trouble.\"  \"You meet up with a lot of unpleasantness in this business, don't you?\"  \"Lot of unpleasant emotions tangled up in it,\" he admitted.  \"I know. Well, supper's been keeping hot for two hours. Shall we eat?\"         *       *       *       *       *  They went to bed at midnight, but it was after one when he became certain that his wife was asleep. He lay in darkness for a time, listening to her even breathing. Then he cautiously eased himself out of bed and tiptoed quietly through the door, carrying his shoes and trousers. He put them on in the kitchen and stole silently out to the kennels. A half moon hung low in a misty sky, and the wind was chilly out of the north.  He went into the neutroid room and flicked a switch. A few sleepy chatters greeted the light.  One at a time, he awoke twenty-three of the older doll-things and carried them to a large glass-walled compartment. These were the long-time residents; they knew him well, and they came with him willingly--like children after the Piper of Hamlin. When he had gotten them in the glass chamber, he sealed the door and turned on the gas. The conveyor would automatically carry them on to the incinerator.  Now he had enough cages for the Bermuda-K-99s.  He hurriedly quit the kennels and went to sit on the back steps. His eyes were burning, but the thought of tears made him sicker. It was like an assassin crying while he stabbed his victim. It was more honest just to retch.  When he tiptoed back inside, he got as far as the hall. Then he saw Anne's small figure framed in the bedroom window, silhouetted against the moonlit yard. She had slipped into her negligee and was sitting on the narrow windowstool, staring silently out at the dull red tongue of exhaust gases from the crematory's chimney.  Norris backed away. He went to the parlor and lay down on the couch.  After a while he heard her come into the room. She paused in the center of the rug, a fragile mist in the darkness. He turned his face away and waited for the rasping accusation. But soon she came to sit on the edge of the sofa. She said nothing. Her hand crept out and touched his cheek lightly. He felt her cool finger-tips trace a soft line up his temple.  \"It's all right, Terry,\" she whispered.  He kept his face averted. Her fingers traced a last stroke. Then she padded quietly back to the bedroom. He lay awake until dawn, knowing that it would never be all right, neither the creating nor the killing, until he--and the whole world--completely lost sanity. And then everything would be all right, only it still wouldn't make sense.         *       *       *       *       *  Anne was asleep when he left the house. The night mist had gathered into clouds that made a gloomy morning of it. He drove on out in the kennel-truck, meaning to get the rest of the Bermuda-K-99s so that he could begin his testing.  Still he felt the night's guilt, like a sticky dew that refused to depart with morning. Why should he have to kill the things? The answer was obvious. Society manufactured them because killing them was permissible. Human babies could not be disposed of when the market became glutted. The neutroids offered solace to childless women, kept them satisfied with a restricted birth rate. And why a restricted birth rate? Because by keeping the population at five billions, the Federation could insure a decent living standard for everybody.  Where there was giving, Norris thought glumly, there was also taking away. Man had always deluded himself by thinking that he \"created,\" but he created nothing. He thought that he had created--with his medical science and his end to wars--a longer life for the individual. But he found that he had only taken the lives of the unborn and added them to the years of the aged. Man now had a life expectancy of eighty, except that he had damn little chance of being born to enjoy it.  A neutroid filled the cradle in his stead. A neutroid that never ate as much, or grew up to be unemployed. A neutroid could be killed if things got tough, but could still satisfy a woman's craving to mother something small.  Norris gave up thinking about it. Eventually he would have to adjust to it. He was already adjusted to a world that loved the artificial mutants as children. He had been brought up in it. Emotion came in conflict with the grim necessities of his job. Somehow he would have to love them in the parlor and kill them in the kennel. It was only a matter of adjustment.         *       *       *       *       *  At noon, he brought back another dozen K-99s and installed them in his cages. There had been two highly reluctant mothers, but he skipped them and left the seizure to the local authorities. Yates had already brought in the three from yesterday.  \"No more scratches?\" Anne asked him while they ate lunch. They did not speak of the night's mass-disposal.  Norris smiled mechanically. \"I learned my lesson yesterday. If they bare their fangs, I get out without another word. Funny thing though--I've got a feeling one mother pulled a fast one.\"  \"What happened?\"  \"Well, I told her what I wanted and why. She didn't like it, but she let me in. I started out with her newt, but she wanted a receipt. So I gave her one; took the serial number off my checklist. She looked at it and said, 'Why, that's not Chichi's number!' I looked at the newt's foot, and sure enough it wasn't. I had to leave it. It was a K-99, but not even from Bermuda.\"  \"I thought they were all registered,\" Anne said.  \"They are. I told her she had the wrong neutroid, but she got mad. Went and got the sales receipt. It checked with her newt, and it was from O'Reilley's pet shop--right place, wrong number. I just don't get it.\"  \"Nothing to worry about, is it Terry?\"  He looked at her peculiarly. \"Ever think what might happen if someone started a black market in neutroids?\"  They finished the meal in silence. After lunch he went out again to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51651"],["title","Conditionally Human (#3)"],["body","up the rest of the group. By four o'clock, he had gotten all that were to be had without the threat of a warrant. The screams and pleas and tears of the owners left him gloomily despising himself.  If Delmont's falsification had been widespread, he might have to turn several of the thirty-five over to central lab for dissection and ultimate destruction. That would bring the murderous wrath of their owners down upon him. He began to understand why bio-inspectors were frequently shifted from one territory to another.  On the way home, he stopped in Sherman II to check on the missing number. It was the largest of the Sherman communities, covering fifty blocks of commercial buildings. He parked in the outskirts and took a sidewalk escalator toward O'Reilley's address.  It was on a dingy sidestreet, reminiscent of past centuries, a street of small bars and bowling alleys and cigar stores. There was even a shop with three gold balls above the entrance, but the place was now an antique store. A light mist was falling when he stepped off the escalator and stood in front of the pet shop. A sign hung out over the sidewalk, announcing:                           J. \"DOGGY\" O'REILLEY                              PETS FOR SALE                        DUMB BLONDES AND GOLDFISH                        MUTANTS FOR THE CHILDLESS                           BUY A BUNDLE OF JOY  Norris frowned at the sign and wandered inside. The place was warm and gloomy. He wrinkled his nose at the strong musk of animal odors. O'Reilley's was not a shining example of cleanliness.  Somewhere a puppy was yapping, and a parrot croaked the lyrics of _A Chimp to Call My Own_, which Norris recognized as the theme song of a popular soap-opera about a lady evolvotron operator.  He paused briefly by a tank of silk-draped goldfish. The shop had a customer. An elderly lady was haggling with a wizened manager over the price of a half grown second-hand dog-F. She was shaking her last dog's death certificate under his nose and demanding a guarantee of the dog's alleged F-5 intelligence. The old man offered to swear on a Bible, but he demurred when it came to swearing on a ledger.  The dog was saying, \"Don' sell me, Dada. Don' sell me.\"  Norris smiled sardonically to himself. The non-human pets were smarter than the neutroids. A K-108 could speak a dozen words, and a K-99 never got farther than \"mamma,\" \"pappa,\" and \"cookie.\" Anthropos was afraid to make the quasi-humans too intelligent, lest sentimentalists proclaim them really human.  He wandered on toward the back of the building, pausing briefly by the cash register to inspect O'Reilley's license, which hung in a dusty frame on the wall behind the counter. \"James Fallon O'Reilley ... authorized dealer in mutant animals ... all non-predatory mammals including chimpanzee-K series ... license expires June 1, 2235.\"  It seemed in order, although the expiration date was approaching. He started toward a bank of neutroid cages along the opposite wall, but O'Reilley was mincing across the floor to meet him. The customer had gone. The little manager wore an elfin professional smile, and his bald head bobbled in a welcoming nod.  \"Good day, sir, good day! May I show you a dwarf kangaroo, or a--\" He stopped and adjusted his spectacles. He blinked and peered as Norris flashed his badge. His smile waned.  \"I'm Agent Norris, Mr. O'Reilley. Called you yesterday for that rundown on K-99 sales.\"  O'Reilley looked suddenly nervous. \"Oh, yes. Find 'em all?\"  Norris shook his head. \"No. That's why I stopped by. There's some mistake on--\" he glanced at his list--\"on K-99-LJZ-351. Let's check it again.\"  O'Reilley seemed to cringe. \"No mistake. I gave you the buyer's name.\"  \"She has a different number.\"  \"Can I help it if she traded with somebody?\"  \"She didn't. She bought it here. I saw the receipt.\"  \"Then she traded with one of my other customers!\" snapped the old man.  \"Two of your customers have the same name--Adelia Schultz? Not likely. Let's see your duplicate receipt book.\"  O'Reilley's wrinkled face set itself into a stubborn mask. \"Doubt if it's still around.\"  Norris frowned. \"Look, pop, I've had a rough day. I _could_ start naming some things around here that need fixing--sanitary violations and such. Not to mention that sign--'dumb blondes.' They outlawed that one when they executed that shyster doctor for shooting K-108s full of growth hormones, trying to raise himself a harem to sell. Besides, you're required to keep sales records until they've been micro-filmed. There hasn't been a microfilming since July.\"  The wrinkled face twitched with frustrated anger. O'Reilley shuffled to the counter while Norris followed. He got a fat binder from under the register and started toward a wooden stairway.  \"Where you going?\" Norris called.  \"Get my old glasses,\" the manager grumbled. \"Can't see through these new things.\"  \"Leave the book here and _I'll_ check it,\" Norris offered.  But O'Reilley was already limping quickly up the stairs. He seemed not to hear. He shut the door behind him, and Norris heard the lock click. The bio-agent waited. Again the thought of a black market troubled him. Unauthorized neutroids could mean lots of trouble.         *       *       *       *       *  Five minutes passed before the old man came down the stairs. He said nothing as he placed the book on the counter. Norris noticed that his hands were trembling as he shuffled through the pages.  \"Let _me_ look,\" said the bio-agent.  O'Reilley stepped reluctantly aside. Norris had memorized the owner's receipt number, and he found the duplicate quickly. He stared at it silently. \"Mrs. Adele Schultz ... chimpanzee-K-99-LJZ-351.\" It was the number of the animal he wanted, but it wasn't the number on Mrs. Schultz's neutroid nor on her original copy of the receipt.  He held the book up to his eye and aimed across the page at the light. O'Reilley's breathing became audible. Norris put the book down, folded two thicknesses of handkerchief over the blade of his pocketknife, and ran it down the seam between the pages. He took the sheet he wanted, folded it, and stowed it in his vest pocket. O'Reilley was stuttering angrily.  Norris turned to face him coldly. \"Nice erasure job, for a carbon copy.\"  The old man prepared himself for exploding. Norris quietly put on his hat.  \"See you in court, O'Reilley.\"  \"_Wait!_\"  Norris turned. \"Okay, I'm waiting.\"  The old man sagged into a deflated bag of wrinkles. \"Let's sit down first,\" he said weakly.  Norris followed him up the stairs and into a dingy parlor. The tiny apartment smelled of boiled cabbage and sweat. An orange-haired neutroid lay asleep on a small rug in a corner. Norris knelt beside it and read the tattooed figures on the sole of its left foot--K-99-LJZ-351. Somehow he was not surprised.  When he stood up, the old man was sagged in an ancient armchair, his head propped on a hand that covered his eyes.  \"Lots of good explanations, I guess?\" Norris asked quietly.  \"Not good ones.\"  \"Let's hear them, anyway.\"  O'Reilley sighed and straightened. He blinked at the inspector and spoke in a monotone. \"My missus died five years back. We were class-B--allowed one child of our own--if we could have one. We couldn't. But since we were class-B, we couldn't own a neutroid either. Sorta got around it by running a pet shop. Mary--she always cried when we sold a neut. I sorta felt bad about it myself. But we never did swipe one. Last year this Bermuda shipment come in. I sold most of 'em pretty quick, but Peony here--she was kinda puny. Seemed like nobody wanted her. Kept her around so long, I got attached to her. 'Fraid somebody'd buy her. So I faked the receipt and moved her up here.\"  \"That all?\"  The old man nodded.  \"Ever done this before?\"  He shook his head.  Norris let a long silence pass while he struggled with himself. At last he said, \"Your license could be revoked, you know.\"  \"I know.\"  Norris ground his fist thoughtfully in his palm and stared at the sleeping doll-thing. \"I'll take your books home with me tonight,\" he said. \"I want to make a complete check for similar changes. Any objections?\"  \"None. It's the only trick I've pulled, so help me.\"  \"If that's true, I won't report you. We'll just attach a correction to that page, and you'll put the newt back in stock.\" He hesitated. \"Providing it's not a deviant. I'll have to take it in for examination.\"  A choking sound came from the armchair. Norris stared curiously at the old man. Moisture was creeping in the wrinkles around his eyes.  \"Something the matter?\"  O'Reilley nodded. \"She's a deviant.\"  \"How do you know?\"  The dealer pulled himself erect and hobbled to the sleeping neutroid. He knelt beside it and stroked a small bare shoulder gently.  \"Peony,\" he breathed. \"Peony, girl--wake up.\"  Its fluffy tail twitched for a moment. Then it sat up, rubbing its eyes and yawning. It _looked_ normal, like a two-year-old girl with soft brown eyes. It pouted at O'Reilley for awakening it. It saw Norris and ignored him, apparently too sleepy to be frightened.  \"How's my Peony-girl?\" the dealer purred.  It licked its lips. \"Wanna g'ass o' water, Daddy,\" it said drowsily.  Norris caught his breath. No K-99 should be able to make a speech that long, even when it reached the developmental limit. He glanced at O'Reilley. The old man nodded slowly, then went to the kitchen for a glass of water. She drank greedily and eyed her foster-parent.  \"Daddy crying.\"  O'Reilley glowered at her and blew his nose solemnly. \"Don't be silly, child. Now get your coat on and go with Mister Norris. He's taking you for a ride in his truck. Won't that be fine?\"  \"I don't want to. I wanna stay here.\"  \"_Peeony!_ On with you!\"  She brought her coat and stared at Norris with childish contempt. \"Can Daddy go, too?\"  \"Be on your way!\" growled O'Reilley. \"I got things to do.\"  \"We're coming back?\"  \"Of course you're coming back! _Git_ now--or shall I get my spanking switch?\"  Peony"]]]
