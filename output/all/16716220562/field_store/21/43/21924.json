A Bertram Harrison lulled into a semi-cataleptic state by the wiles of a Gloria Hanford would hardly be expected to rise in a sudden burst of strength.\"  \"So no matter what I do, I'm wrong?\" the girl asked.  \"Not at all,\" said Scholar Ross. \"It is your direct responsibilty--your _duty_--to do everything you can to establish a firm and stable family unit here with Bertram Harrison--\"  \"Sorry, Scholar Ross,\" said Mr. Harrison icily. \"You haven't really heard me. Your notion that this affair is a civil argument between an affianced couple is not true. You imply that no laws have been broken. You are wrong. I am willing to sign a complaint right now that Miss Gloria Hanford deliberately induced my son to indulge in her therapy. It was her means of lulling him into a state of mind that would permit her to go gallivanting off on a date with another man.\"  \"I am not married to Berty yet!\" snapped Gloria. \"Dating's still my right!\"  \"Oh,\" snarled Mr. Harrison angrily, \"shut up or I'll sign a complaint that you administered medical treatment without a license! Insofar as the Harrison family is concerned, this engagement shall be terminated unfavorably. Come!\" he said to his wife. She rose to follow.  Gloria stepped aside, but paused to ask, \"Aren't you going to take Bertie with you?\"  Mrs. Hanford said coldly, \"He's already been taken to the hospital for treatment to bring him out of the trance you got him into. And so, Miss Hanford, will you please step aside and let me pass?\"  And Mr. Harrison's parting shot was, \"I shall sign my complaints in the morning--or if he is able, we'll make it thoroughly legal and have Bertram sign them.\"  He closed the door firmly.  Mrs. Hanford wailed, \"Now what shall we do?\"  Scholar Ross shook his head. \"With this poor record, this non-cooperation,\" he said slowly, \"it will be well nigh impossible to arrange another union, furthermore, if Harrison carries out his threat--\"  Gloria said quickly, \"If he wants to, he can talk Bertie into anything. Anything. Such as signing the most frightful complaints and being convinced of their absolute truth and justice.\"  Mr. Hanford said, \"If that's true, he could also be talked back out of them.\"  Scholar Ross shook his head again. \"That presupposes that you could arrange access to Bertram that couldn't be overcome by another talking-to by his parents. It won't work. The young man is a mental weathervane.\"  \"So where do we stand?\"  \"As I say, we might as well prepare for the worst. If the case of Gloria Hanford ever comes under the scrutiny of the Law, she will be declared either a delinquent or an incorrigible, depending upon whether her escapades are ruled misdemeanors or felonies.\" Scholar Ross turned to Gloria Hanford. \"I warned you. Now, where we of the Department of Domestic Tranquility have no power to force you into a proper course of action, you'll find that the Law most certainly has. Miss Hanford, the Law will decide just how dangerous you are to the civic peace. Upon that decision, the law will further decide what action it must take to protect that civic peace from you.\"  He paused. A silence followed his statements. He waited a few moments to let his words sink in. Then he walked to the door and said:  \"As of now, the future of Miss Gloria Hanford is out of my hands.\"  Mr. Hanford said, \"Scholar Ross, how bad is this likely to be?\"  \"A lot will depend upon how swiftly Bertram Harrison responds to the restorative treatment. With some luck and a brilliant attorney on your side the matter might not reach a major catastrophe. Tomorrow may tell.\"   IX  Junior Spaceman Howard Reed said plaintively, \"But this is the Bureau of Justice. According to the Regulations you are supposed to listen to me, at least.\"  The space officer behind the desk wore the three wide stripes of the commander's rank, topped by the fasces that symbolized the law. He was Commander Hughes, chief of the Space Service Bureau of Justice. He smiled at the junior spaceman but shook his head. \"You would place us in a most difficult position were we to heed your plea without having the matter referred to us through official channels.\"  With some exasperation, Reed said, \"Look, sir, I've been subject to a severe injustice. Why can't I at least tell my problem to someone?\"  \"That would be cutting across channels. It simply is not done.\"  \"Commander Hughes,\" said the junior spaceman earnestly, \"you're not serving justice. You're obstructing it!\"  \"Now see here, young man--\"  \"Commander Hughes, you're insisting that I request my superior officer to forward through official channels a complaint against him. First, sir, I point out that he would refuse my request unless he were absolutely certain that my case against him was ridiculously weak. Second, I'm certain that the request would bring quick retaliation.\"  Commander Hughes shook his head. \"The Regulation provides that any reasonable request be forwarded. And the Regulation further provides that there shall be no punitive action.\"  Reed snorted. \"Fine. And if I do find myself punished, must I next forward my request for investigation through the same officer?\"  \"That is a serious charge, young man.\"  \"I can substantiate it! Look, sir, quite a long time ago I made some scientific studies, and--\"  \"You're an Operations officer, Mr. Reed?\"  \"Yes, but--\"  \"Then you're not trained in science?\"  \"Let's not go on that rat-race right now,\" said the junior spaceman testily. \"I've heard it before. That's why I'm here!\"  \"Very well.\"  Junior Spaceman Howard Reed took a deep breath and plunged into his long explanation. At the end, Commander Hughes nodded, his face in a non-committal mask.  \"One moment now,\" he said. He turned to the working desk behind him and spoke into a telephone. It had neither visual plate nor amplified output; only the user could know what was being communicated, and with whom.  \"Now we'll see,\" said the commander as he hung up the telephone.         *       *       *       *       *  With the awkwardness of a stopped trivideo drama they stood and sat there motionless and silently as the minutes dragged past. Ultimately there was a gentle alarm ring from one of the desk drawers. Commander Hughes opened it to extract a couple of yards of stereofac paper.  \"Your service record,\" explained the commander, picking up a reading prism and starting at the top. \"Just another moment.\"  Another half dozen minutes went past.  \"'Junior Spaceman Howard Reed,'\" the commander read quietly at last, \"'has an exemplary record.' That is Commander Breckenridge's opinion, if we are to believe what we read in this record. Oh, perhaps, he thought, a bit headstrong and mildly argumentative, factors which he considered balanced by a faculty for deep concentration.\"  \"And how about my being transferred to Eden, Tau Ceti? And then to Flatbush, Lalande 25372?\" Reed demanded.  \"'Reasons for transfer,'\" read Commander Hughes from the record. \"'Junior Spaceman Howard Reed is ambitious and overactive. In the considered opinion of Commander Breckenridge, he will make a fine superior officer once his duty-experience has the proper breadth.'\" The commander looked up and waved a hand at the length of stereofac. The fasces wrought in gold above the stripes glittered in the light. \"Were it not for the Regulations against permitting a junior officer to inspect his own service record,\" said Commander Hughes with a smile, \"I'd let you see for yourself that nowhere on this record is there a single word that corroborates your suggestion. Your tour of duty on Flatbush, Lalande 25372, and your earlier transfer to Eden, Tau Ceti, were merely the standard tour of duty, granted to satisfactory junior officers as a means of properly broadening their experience.\"  \"In other words,\" snapped Reed angrily, \"the fact that I have crossed space in a craft powered by a technical suggestion made by me some years ago does not prove a thing.\"  \"Can you prove that you made any such technical suggestion?\"  \"Yes. Call Commander Briggs of the Bureau of Research. Call Commander Breckenridge of the Bureau of Operations. Demand that they state under oath, whether I did or did not make such suggestions. I was told my ideas were worthless.\"  \"In other words, the Bureau of Research says it wouldn't work?\"  \"But look, sir! I drove a spacecraft all the way from--\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Bureau of Justice officer held up a hand.  \"Look,\" said the junior spaceman angrily, \"all I want is justice!\"  \"And justice you'll get!\" retorted Commander Hughes. \"First, Mr. Reed, let me ask how you obtained permission to leave your post on Flatbush, Lalande 25372, so that you could come to the headquarters in person to state your plea? Or was this trip authorized?\"  \"Well, sir--the detector and beacon stations are completely automated and--\"  \"In blunt terms you are absent without leave?\"  \"Well, sir--\"  \"Junior Spaceman Howard Reed, you will consider yourself under personal arrest. We have no alternative but to place you in the custody of the Space Security Police. Remain as you were!\"  Like the fabled case of the drowning man, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed reviewed his past in a single flash before his eyes. In the second blink, he covered his present. It wasn't to his liking.  Having covered his past and discarded his present, he next inspected his most probable future and came to the almost immediate conclusion that there wasn't very much in it for him. He had never heard Napoleon's statement that God was on the side with the heaviest artillery, but, in his own way, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed came to a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/519"],["title","A Kidnapped Santa Claus (#0)"],["body","Kidnapped Santa Claus   by  L. Frank Baum    Santa Claus lives in the Laughing Valley, where stands the big, rambling castle in which his toys are manufactured.  His workmen, selected from the ryls, knooks, pixies and fairies, live with him, and every one is as busy as can be from one year's end to another.  It is called the Laughing Valley because everything there is happy and gay.  The brook chuckles to itself as it leaps rollicking between its green banks; the wind whistles merrily in the trees; the sunbeams dance lightly over the soft grass, and the violets and wild flowers look smilingly up from their green nests.  To laugh one needs to be happy; to be happy one needs to be content.  And throughout the Laughing Valley of Santa Claus contentment reigns supreme.  On one side is the mighty Forest of Burzee.  At the other side stands the huge mountain that contains the Caves of the Daemons.  And between them the Valley lies smiling and peaceful.  One would thing that our good old Santa Claus, who devotes his days to making children happy, would have no enemies on all the earth; and, as a matter of fact, for a long period of time he encountered nothing but love wherever he might go.  But the Daemons who live in the mountain caves grew to hate Santa Claus very much, and all for the simple reason that he made children happy.  The Caves of the Daemons are five in number.  A broad pathway leads up to the first cave, which is a finely arched cavern at the foot of the mountain, the entrance being beautifully carved and decorated.  In it resides the Daemon of Selfishness.  Back of this is another cavern inhabited by the Daemon of Envy.  The cave of the Daemon of Hatred is next in order, and through this one passes to the home of the Daemon of Malice--situated in a dark and fearful cave in the very heart of the mountain.  I do not know what lies beyond this.  Some say there are terrible pitfalls leading to death and destruction, and this may very well be true.  However, from each one of the four caves mentioned there is a small, narrow tunnel leading to the fifth cave--a cozy little room occupied by the Daemon of Repentance.  And as the rocky floors of these passages are well worn by the track of passing feet, I judge that many wanderers in the Caves of the Daemons have escaped through the tunnels to the abode of the Daemon of Repentance, who is said to be a pleasant sort of fellow who gladly opens for one a little door admitting you into fresh air and sunshine again.  Well, these Daemons of the Caves, thinking they had great cause to dislike old Santa Claus, held a meeting one day to discuss the matter.  \"I'm really getting lonesome,\" said the Daemon of Selfishness.  \"For Santa Claus distributes so many pretty Christmas gifts to all the children that they become happy and generous, through his example, and keep away from my cave.\"  \"I'm having the same trouble,\" rejoined the Daemon of Envy.  \"The little ones seem quite content with Santa Claus, and there are few, indeed, that I can coax to become envious.\"  \"And that makes it bad for me!\" declared the Daemon of Hatred.  \"For if no children pass through the Caves of Selfishness and Envy, none can get to MY cavern.\"  \"Or to mine,\" added the Daemon of Malice.  \"For my part,\" said the Daemon of Repentance, \"it is easily seen that if children do not visit your caves they have no need to visit mine; so that I am quite as neglected as you are.\"  \"And all because of this person they call Santa Claus!\" exclaimed the Daemon of Envy.  \"He is simply ruining our business, and something must be done at once.\"  To this they readily agreed; but what to do was another and more difficult matter to settle.  They knew that Santa Claus worked all through the year at his castle in the Laughing Valley, preparing the gifts he was to distribute on Christmas Eve; and at first they resolved to try to tempt him into their caves, that they might lead him on to the terrible pitfalls that ended in destruction.  So the very next day, while Santa Claus was busily at work, surrounded by his little band of assistants, the Daemon of Selfishness came to him and said:  \"These toys are wonderfully bright and pretty.  Why do you not keep them for yourself?  It's a pity to give them to those noisy boys and fretful girls, who break and destroy them so quickly.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried the old graybeard, his bright eyes twinkling merrily as he turned toward the tempting Daemon.  \"The boys and girls are never so noisy and fretful after receiving my presents, and if I can make them happy for one day in the year I am quite content.\"  So the Daemon went back to the others, who awaited him in their caves, and said:  \"I have failed, for Santa Claus is not at all selfish.\"  The following day the Daemon of Envy visited Santa Claus.  Said he: \"The toy shops are full of playthings quite as pretty as those you are making.  What a shame it is that they should interfere with your business!  They make toys by machinery much quicker than you can make them by hand; and they sell them for money, while you get nothing at all for your work.\"  But Santa Claus refused to be envious of the toy shops.  \"I can supply the little ones but once a year--on Christmas Eve,\" he answered; \"for the children are many, and I am but one.  And as my work is one of love and kindness I would be ashamed to receive money for my little gifts.  But throughout all the year the children must be amused in some way, and so the toy shops are able to bring much happiness to my little friends.  I like the toy shops, and am glad to see them prosper.\"  In spite of the second rebuff, the Daemon of Hatred thought he would try to influence Santa Claus.  So the next day he entered the busy workshop and said:  \"Good morning, Santa!  I have bad news for you.\"  \"Then run away, like a good fellow,\" answered Santa Claus.  \"Bad news is something that should be kept secret and never told.\"  \"You cannot escape this, however,\" declared the Daemon; \"for in the world are a good many who do not believe in Santa Claus, and these you are bound to hate bitterly, since they have so wronged you.\"  \"Stuff and rubbish!\" cried Santa.  \"And there are others who resent your making children happy and who sneer at you and call you a foolish old rattlepate!  You are quite right to hate such base slanderers, and you ought to be revenged upon them for their evil words.\"  \"But I don't hate 'em!\" exclaimed Santa Claus positively.  \"Such people do me no real harm, but merely render themselves and their children unhappy.  Poor things!  I'd much rather help them any day than injure them.\"  Indeed, the Daemons could not tempt old Santa Claus in any way.  On the contrary, he was shrewd enough to see that their object in visiting him was to make mischief and trouble, and his cheery laughter disconcerted the evil ones and showed to them the folly of such an undertaking.  So they abandoned honeyed words and determined to use force.  It was well known that no harm can come to Santa Claus while he is in the Laughing Valley, for the fairies, and ryls, and knooks all protect him.  But on Christmas Eve he drives his reindeer out into the big world, carrying a sleighload of toys and pretty gifts to the children; and this was the time and the occasion when his enemies had the best chance to injure him.  So the Daemons laid their plans and awaited the arrival of Christmas Eve.  The moon shone big and white in the sky, and the snow lay crisp and sparkling on the ground as Santa Claus cracked his whip and sped away out of the Valley into the great world beyond.  The roomy sleigh was packed full with huge sacks of toys, and as the reindeer dashed onward our jolly old Santa laughed and whistled and sang for very joy.  For in all his merry life this was the one day in the year when he was happiest--the day he lovingly bestowed the treasures of his workshop upon the little children.  It would be a busy night for him, he well knew.  As he whistled and shouted and cracked his whip again, he reviewed in mind all the towns and cities and farmhouses where he was expected, and figured that he had just enough presents to go around and make every child happy.  The reindeer knew exactly what was expected of them, and dashed along so swiftly that their feet scarcely seemed to touch the snow-covered ground.  Suddenly a strange thing happened: a rope shot through the moonlight and a big noose that was in the end of it settled over the arms and body of Santa Claus and drew tight.  Before he could resist or even cry out he was jerked from the seat of the sleigh and tumbled head foremost into a snowbank, while the reindeer rushed onward with the load of toys and carried it quickly out of sight and sound.  Such a surprising experience confused old Santa for a moment, and when he had collected his senses he found that the wicked Daemons had pulled him from the snowdrift and bound him tightly with many coils of the stout rope.  And then they carried the kidnapped Santa Claus away to their mountain, where they thrust the prisoner into a secret cave and chained him to the rocky wall so that he could not escape.  \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the Daemons, rubbing their hands together with cruel glee.  \"What will the children do now?  How they will cry and scold and storm when they find there are no toys in their stockings and no gifts on their Christmas trees!  And what a lot of punishment they will receive from their parents, and how they will flock to our Caves of Selfishness, and Envy, and Hatred, and Malice!  We have done a mighty clever thing, we Daemons of the Caves!\"  Now it so chanced that on this Christmas Eve the good Santa Claus had taken with him in his sleigh Nuter the Ryl, Peter the Knook, Kilter the Pixie, and a small fairy named Wisk--his four favorite assistants. These little people he had often found very useful in helping him to distribute his gifts to the children, and when their master was so suddenly dragged from the sleigh"]]]
