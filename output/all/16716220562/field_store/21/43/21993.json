Chagrin restored my strength and I leaped to my feet to look for the treasure, and for a long time I beat around in vain.  Worn out with work and vexation, I forced my way into the thickest part of the grove and remained there for four mortal hours, but at last, bored to extinction by the horrible solitude, I sought a way out.  As I went ahead, I caught sight of a peasant; then I had need of all my nerve, and it did not fail me.  Marching boldly up to him, I asked my way to the city, complaining that I had been lost in the wood for several hours.  Seeing my condition, he took pity upon me, for I was covered with mud and paler than death, and asked me whether I had seen anyone in the place.  “Not a soul,” I replied, whereupon he kindly conducted me to the high road, where he met two of his companions, who informed him that they had beaten along every path in the forest without having found anything except a tunic, which they showed him.  As may be readily supposed, I did not have the audacity to claim it, though well aware of its value, and my chagrin became almost insupportable as I vented many a groaning curse over my lost treasure.  The peasants paid no attention to me, and I was gradually left behind, as my weakness increased my pace decreased.  For this reason, it was late when I reached the city, and, entering the inn, beheld Ascyltos, stretched out, half dead, upon a cot.  Too far gone to utter a single syllable, I threw myself upon another.  Ascyltos became greatly excited at not seeing the tunic which he had entrusted to me, demanding it insistently, but I was so weak that my voice refused its office and I permitted the apathy of my eyes to answer his demand, then, by and by, regaining my strength little by little, I related the whole affair to Ascyltos, in every detail.  He thought that I was joking, and although my testimony was fortified by a copious flood of tears, it could easily be seen that he remained unconvinced, believing that I wanted to cheat him out of the gold. Giton, who was standing by during all this, was as downcast as myself, and the suffering of the lad only served to increase my own vexation, but the thing which bothered me most of all, was the painstaking search which was being made for us; I told Ascyltos of this, but he only laughed it off, as he had so happily extricated himself from the scrape.  He was convinced that, as we were unknown and as no one had seen us, we were perfectly safe.  We decided, nevertheless, to feign sickness, and to keep to our room as long as possible; but, before we knew it, our money ran out, and spurred by necessity we were forced to go abroad and sell some of our plunder.)     CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.  Twilight was falling, as we entered the market-place, in which we noticed a quantity of things for sale, not any of much value, it is true, but such as could be disposed of to the best advantage when the semi-darkness would serve to hide their doubtful origin.  As we had brought our stolen mantle, we proceeded to make use of so favorable an opportunity, and, in a secluded spot, displayed a corner of it, hoping the splendid garment would attract some purchaser.  Nor was it long before a certain peasant, whose face was familiar to my eyes, came up, accompanied by a young woman, and began to examine the garment very closely.  Ascyltos, in turn, cast a glance at the shoulders of our rustic customer, and was instantly struck dumb with astonishment.  Nor could I myself look upon this man without some emotion, for he seemed to be the identical person who had picked up the ragged tunic in the lonely wood, and, as a matter of fact, he was!  Ascyltos, afraid to believe the evidence of his own eyes for fear of doing something rash, approached the man, as a prospective buyer, took the hem of the tunic from the rustic’s shoulders, and felt it thoroughly.     CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.  Oh wonderful stroke of Fortune!  The peasant had not yet laid his meddling hands upon the seams, but was scornfully offering the thing for sale, as though it had been the leavings of some beggar.  When Ascyltos had assured himself that the hoard was intact, and had taken note of the social status of the seller, he led me a little aside from the crowd and said, “Do you know, ‘brother,’ that the treasure about which I was so worked up has come back to us?  That is the little tunic, and it seems that the gold pieces are still untouched.  What ought we to do, and how shall we make good our claim?”  I was overjoyed, not so much at seeing our booty, as I was for the reason that Fortune had released me from a very ugly suspicion.  I was opposed to doing anything by devious methods, thinking that should he prove unwilling to restore to the proper owner an article not his own, it ought to come to a civil action and a judgment secured.     CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.  Not so Ascyltos, who was afraid of the law, and demurred, “Who knows us here?  Who will place any credence in anything we say?  It seems to me that it would be better to buy, ours though it is, and we know it, and recover the treasure at small cost, rather than to engage in a doubtful lawsuit.”            Of what avail are any laws, where money rules alone,            Where Poverty can never win its cases?            Detractors of the times, who bear the Cynic’s scrip, are known            To often sell the truth, and keep their faces!            So Justice is at public auction bought,            The knight gives judgement as Gold says he ought.  But, with the exception of a two-as piece with which we had intended purchasing peas and lupines, there was nothing to hand; so, for fear our loot should escape us in the interim, we resolved to appraise the mantle at less, and, through a small sacrifice, secure a greater profit. Accordingly, we spread it out, and the young woman of the covered head, who was standing by the peasant’s side, narrowly inspected the markings, seized the hem with both hands, and screamed “Thieves!” at the top of her voice.  We were greatly disconcerted at this and, for fear that inactivity on our part should seem to lend color to her charges, we laid hold of the dirty ragged tunic, in our turn, and shouted with equal spite, that this was our property which they had in their possession; but our cases were by no means on an equality, and the hucksters who had crowded around us at the uproar, laughed at our spiteful claim, and very naturally, too, since one side laid claim to a very valuable mantle, while the other demanded a rag which was not worth a good patch.     CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.  Ascyltos, when he had secured silence, adroitly put a stop to their laughter by exclaiming, “We can see that each puts the greater value upon his own property.  Let them return our tunic to us, and take back their mantle!”  This exchange was satisfactory enough to the peasant and the young woman, but some night-prowling shyster lawyers, who wished to get possession of the mantle for their own profit, demanded that both articles be deposited with them, and the judge could look into the case on the morrow, for it would appear that the ownership of the articles was not so much to the point as was the suspicion of robbery that attached to both sides.  The question of sequestration arose, and one of the hucksters, I do not remember which, but he was bald, and his forehead was covered with sebaceous wens, and he sometimes did odd jobs for the lawyers, seized the mantle and vowed that HE would see to it that it was produced at the proper time and place, but it was easily apparent that he desired nothing but that the garment should be deposited with thieves, and vanish; thinking that we would be afraid to appear as claimants for fear of being charged with crime.  As far as we were concerned, we were as willing as he, and Fortune aided the cause of each of us, for the peasant, infuriated at our demand that his rags be shown in public, threw the tunic in Ascyltos’ face, released us from responsibility, and demanded that the mantle, which was the only object of litigation, be sequestered.  As we thought we had recovered our treasure, we returned hurriedly to the inn, and fastening the door, we had a good laugh at the shrewdness of the hucksters, and not less so at that of our enemies, for by it they had returned our money to us.  (While we were unstitching the tunic to get at the gold pieces, we overheard some one quizzing the innkeeper as to what kind of people those were, who had just entered his house.  Alarmed at this inquiry, I went down, when the questioner had gone, to find out what was the matter, and learned that the praetor’s lictor, whose duty it was to see that the names of strangers were entered in his rolls, had seen two people come into the inn, whose names were not yet entered, and that was the reason he had made inquiry as to their names and means of support.  Mine host furnished this information in such an offhand manner that I became suspicious as to our entire safety in his house; so, in order to avoid arrest, we decided to go out, and not to return home until after dark, and we sallied forth, leaving the management of dinner to Giton.  As it suited our purpose to avoid the public streets, we strolled through the more unfrequented parts of the city, and just at dusk we met two women in stolas, in a lonely spot, and they were by no means homely.  Walking softly, we followed them to a temple which they entered, and from which we could hear a curious humming, which resembled the sound of voices issuing from the depths of a cavern.  Curiosity impelled us also to enter the temple.  There we caught sight of many women, who resembled Bacchantes, each of whom brandished in her right hand an emblem of Priapus.  We were not permitted to see more, for as their eyes fell upon us, they raised such a hubbub"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],["title","The Satyricon — Complete (#7)"],["body","the vault of the temple trembled.  They attempted to lay hands upon us, but we ran back to our inn as fast as we could go.)     CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH.  We had just disposed of the supper prepared by Giton, when there came a timid rapping at the door.  We turned pale.  “Who is there?”  we asked. “Open and you will find out,” came the answer.  While we were speaking, the bar fell down of its own accord, the doors flew open and admitted our visitor.  She was the selfsame young lady of the covered head who had but a little while before stood by the peasant’s side.  “So you thought,”  said she, “that you could make a fool of me, did you?  I am Quartilla’s handmaid: Quartilla, whose rites you interrupted in the shrine.  She has come to the inn, in person, and begs permission to speak with you.  Don’t be alarmed!  She neither blames your mistake nor does she demand punishment; on the contrary, she wonders what god has brought such well-bred young gentlemen into her neighborhood!”     CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.  We were still holding our tongues and refraining from any expression of opinion, when the lady herself entered the room, attended by a little girl.  Seating herself upon the bed, she wept for a long time.  Not even then did we interject a single word, but waited, all attention, for what was to follow these well ordered tears and this show of grief.  When the diplomatic thunderstorm had passed over, she withdrew her haughty head from her mantle and, ringing her hands until the joints cracked, “What is the meaning of such audacity?” she demanded; “where did you learn such tricks?  They are worthy of putting to shame the assurance of all the robbers of the past!  I pity you, so help me the God of Truth, I do; for no one can look with impunity upon that which it is unlawful for him to see.  In our neighborhood, there are so many gods that it is easier to meet one than it is to find a man!  But do not think that I was actuated by any desire for revenge when I came here: I am more moved by your age than I am by my own injury, for it is my belief that youthful imprudence led you into committing a sacrilegious crime.  That very night, I tossed so violently in the throes of a dangerous chill that I was afraid I had contracted a tertian ague, and in my dreams I prayed for a medicine.  I was ordered to seek you out, and to arrest the progress of the disease by means of an expedient to be suggested by your wonderful penetration!  The cure does not matter so much, however, for a deeper grief gnaws at my vitals and drags me down, almost to the very doors of death itself.  I am afraid that, with the careless impulsiveness of youth, you may divulge, to the common herd, what you witnessed in the shrine of Priapus, and reveal the rites of the gods to the rabble.  On this account, I stretch out my suppliant hands to your knees, and beg and pray that you do not make a mockery and a joke of our nocturnal rites, nor lay bare the secrets of so many years, into which scarcely a thousand persons are initiated.”     CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.  The tears poured forth again, after this appeal, and, shaken by deep sobs, she buried her whole face and breast in my bed; and I, moved by pity and by apprehension, begged her to be of good cheer and to make herself perfectly easy as to both of those issues, for not only would we not betray any secrets to the rabble, but we would also second divine providence, at any peril to ourselves, if any god had indicated to her any cure for her tertian ague.  The woman cheered up at this promise, and smothered me with kisses; from tears she passed to laughter, and fell to running her fingers through the long hair that hung down about my ears. “I will declare a truce with you,” she said, “and withdraw my complaint. But had you been unwilling to administer the medicine which I seek, I had a troop in readiness for the morrow, which would have exacted satisfaction for my injury and reparation for my dignity!            To be flouted is disgraceful, but to dictate terms, sublime            Pleased am I to choose what course I will,            Even sages will retort an insult at the proper time.            Victor most is he who does not kill.”  Then she suddenly clapped her hands, and broke into such a peal of laughter that we were alarmed.  The maid, who had been the first to arrive, did likewise, on one side of us, as also did the little girl who had entered with the madame herself.     CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH.  The whole place was filled with mocking laughter, and we, who could see no reason for such a change of front, stared blankly at each other and then at the women.  (Then Quartilla spoke up, finally,) “I gave orders that no mortal man should be admitted into this inn, this day, so that I could receive the treatment for my ague without interruption!”  Ascyltos was, for the moment, struck dumb by this admission of Quartilla’s, and I turned colder than a Gallic winter, and could not utter a word; but the personnel of the company relieved me from the fear that the worst might be yet to come, for they were only three young women, too weak to attempt any violence against us, who were of the male sex, at least, even if we had nothing else of the man about us, and this was an asset.  Then, too, we were girded higher, and I had so arranged matters that if it came to a fight, I would engage Quartilla myself, Ascyltos the maid, and Giton the girl.  (While I was turning over this plan in my mind, Quartilla came to close quarters, to receive the treatment for her ague, but having her hopes disappointed, she flounced out in a rage and, returning in a little while, she had us overpowered by some unknown vagabonds, and gave orders for us to be carried away to a splendid palace.)  Then our determination gave place to astonishment, and death, sure and certain, began to obscure the eyes of suffering.     CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH.  “Pray; madame,” I groaned, “if you have anything worse in store, bring it on quickly for we have not committed a crime so heinous as to merit death by torture.”  The maid, whose name was Psyche, quickly spread a blanket upon the floor (and) sought to secure an erection by fondling my member, which was already a thousand times colder than death.  Ascyltos, well aware by now of the danger of dipping into the secrets of others, covered his head with his mantle.  (In the meantime,) the maid took two ribbons from her bosom and bound our feet with one and our hands with the other. (Finding myself trussed up in this fashion, I remarked, “You will not be able to cure your mistress’ ague in this manner!”  “Granted,” the maid replied, “but I have other and surer remedies at hand,” she brought me a vessel full of satyrion, as she said this, and so cheerfully did she gossip about its virtues that I drank down nearly all of the liquor, and because Ascyltos had but a moment before rejected her advances, she sprinkled the dregs upon his back, without his knowing it.)  When this repartee had drawn to a close, Ascyltos exclaimed, “Don’t I deserve a drink?”  Given away by my laughter, the maid clapped her hands and cried, “I put one by you, young man; did you drink so much all by yourself?”  “What’s that you say?”, Quartilla chimed in.  “Did Encolpius drink all the satyrion there was in the house?”  And she laughed delightfully until her sides shook.  Finally not even Giton himself could resist a smile, especially when the little girl caught him around the neck and showered innumerable kisses upon him, and he not at all averse to it.     CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST.  We would have cried aloud in our misery but there was no one to give us any help, and whenever I attempted to shout, “Help!  all honest citizens,” Psyche would prick my cheeks with her hairpin, and the little girl would intimidate Ascyltos with a brush dipped in satyrion.  Then a catamite appeared, clad in a myrtle-colored frieze robe, and girded round with a belt.  One minute he nearly gored us to death with his writhing buttocks, and the next, he befouled us so with his stinking kisses that Quartilla, with her robe tucked high, held up her whalebone wand and ordered him to give the unhappy wretches quarter.  Both of us then took a most solemn oath that so dread a secret should perish with us.  Several wrestling instructors appeared and refreshed us, worn out as we were, by a massage with pure oil, and when our fatigue had abated, we again donned our dining clothes and were escorted to the next room, in which were placed three couches, and where all the essentials necessary to a splendid banquet were laid out in all their richness.  We took our places, as requested, and began with a wonderful first course.  We were all but submerged in Falernian wine.  When several other courses had followed, and we were endeavoring to keep awake Quartilla exclaimed, “How dare you think of going to sleep when you know that the vigil of Priapus is to be kept?”     CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.  Worn out by all his troubles, Ascyltos commenced to nod, and the maid, whom he had slighted, and of course insulted, smeared lampblack all over his face, and painted his lips and shoulders with vermillion, while he drowsed.  Completely exhausted by so many untoward adventures, I, too, was enjoying the shortest of naps, the whole household, within and without, was doing the same, some were lying here and there asleep at our feet, others leaned against the walls, and some even slept head to head upon the threshold itself; the lamps, failing because of a lack of oil, shed a feeble and flickering light, when two Syrians, bent upon stealing an amphora of wine, entered the dining-room.  While they were greedily pawing among the silver, they pulled the amphora in two, upsetting the table with all the silver plate, and a cup, which had flown pretty high, cut the head of the maid, who was drowsing upon a couch.  She screamed at that, thereby betraying the thieves and wakening some of the"]]]
