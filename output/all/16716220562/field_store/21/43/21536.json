We should also be very careful to keep our promises to one another and to our Heavenly Father.  Points to be remembered in this story: Laman, Lemuel and Ishmael's sons get angry at Nephi and plan among themselves to kill him--The Lord warns Nephi of their intentions and tells him to leave them and go into another part of the country--Those who believe Nephi's words and teachings go with him into the wilderness to find a new home--They travel many days and settle at a place which they name Nephi after their leader--This people afterwards called Nephites, and those whom they left called Lamanites--Here they are greatly blessed of the Lord--They sow seeds and reap an abundance of food--The records on the brass plates, the brass ball and the sword of Laban taken by Nephi to his new home--Nephi makes swords for his people to defend themselves with--The Lord's promises to Nephi are fulfilled.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  NEPHI AND HIS PEOPLE BUILD A TEMPLE.  After Nephi and his people had separated themselves from Laman and his followers, the Lord placed a curse upon the Lamanites. He caused a skin of blackness to come upon them. Before this they were a white and beautiful people; but that they might not be attractive to the Nephites, the Lord caused them to appear loathsome and offensive. This was in order to keep them from associating together in any way.  The Lord instructed the Nephites to not mix with the Lamanites, and told them if they did they too would become cursed like them. The only way for the Lamanites to free themselves from their curse was to repent of their sins. After this curse came upon the Lamanites they became idle, mischievous and filthy; and they gained their living by hunting wild animals and eating their flesh.  Nephi had a great deal to do among his people. Besides teaching them the commandments of the Lord he had to instruct them about many other things. He had to teach them how to build houses, how to work wood, and iron, and copper, and brass, and steel, and gold, and silver, in order to make useful articles out of these materials. He also taught them how to obtain metals from the ore, which was found in great abundance in the mountains. He was very desirous that the people should become industrious and learn to labor with their hands.  Nephi's younger brothers, Jacob and Joseph, and his own children and those of Sam and Zoram were born after their fathers left Jerusalem. They did not know much about building or other kind of work, for they never had seen a city nor even a house. During their travels in the wilderness they lived in tents. Some of these children might have remembered seeing their parents building the ship in which they crossed the ocean, but they were very young at that time.  [Image captioned \"THE NEPHITES BUILDING A TEMPLE.\"]  After teaching the people how to work at these different occupations Nephi built a temple in which the people might meet to worship the Lord and receive instructions. He had the temple made like the one in Jerusalem, which was built by King Solomon, only it was not built of so many precious things. Nephi had seen the temple in Jerusalem and knew how it was built, and he made one like it as near as he could. The work on it was very fine.  Nephi was so well beloved by his people that they desired to make him their king. He did not wish them to have a king but was willing to act as a leader and do all he could for them.  He needed some one to help him as a teacher of the people and he appointed and set apart his two younger brothers Jacob and Joseph as priests, that they might instruct the people. These two men were faithful in their duties and they gave the people very good instruction. The Lord blessed them in their labors and showed them in visions many glorious things, just as he had shown their brother Nephi.  We learn from this story that Nephi was a very wise man. He was able to teach his people how to work at different kinds of occupations as well as to instruct them in their duties to the Lord. Nephi became wise by being obedient. He was taught many things by the Lord. He prayed to the Lord to know what to do and his prayers were answered. The Lord helps those who ask for His aid. He is willing to help them in their work or in their study, or if they are in trouble, or in whatever way they need His help. The only way to be truly wise and to get correct knowledge is to seek the Lord for His guidance.  Points to be remembered in this story: After the Nephites and Lamanites separate the Lord places a curse upon the Lamanites--Causes a skin of darkness to come upon them--This was to make them loathsome to the Nephites, so that they would not associate together--The Lamanites become idle and mischievous--Nephi teaches his people how to work at different occupations--He builds a temple like the one in Jerusalem--The people love Nephi and want to make him their king--He does not wish them to have a king but is willing to do all he can for them as a leader and teacher--Nephi appoints his brothers Jacob and Joseph as priests to help him teach the people their duties--Nephi a wise man--Becomes wise by being obedient to the Lord.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  NEPHI MAKES PLATES ON WHICH TO KEEP A RECORD.  Nephi was very particular to keep a record or history of his people, and to record the instructions he received from the Lord. This was in order that the people might know the many great things the Lord had done for them and their forefathers.  The Lord was very particular about Nephi taking a record of his forefathers with him when he left Jerusalem. You will remember that Nephi and his brothers were sent to Laban for the records, and Nephi was commanded of the Lord to kill Laban in order to get them. The Lord knew that by having the people keep a record of His dealings with them they would not be so apt to forget Him and His commandments.  The Book of Mormon tells about a company of people who left Jerusalem eleven years later than did Nephi and his colony. They brought no records with them. A little more than three hundred years later the children or descendants of these people were found by the people of Nephi. At this time their language was corrupted or changed so much that the two peoples could not understand each other. These people who were without records of any kind had also lost all knowledge of the Lord. They did not know there was a God. This shows how important it is that records should be kept so that the people may remember the commandments of the Lord, and not forget Him as these people did.  Nephi made some plates from metal on which he wrote or engraved an account of his people from the time they left Jerusalem until a short time before he died. On these plates he wrote a full history of the people. Afterwards the Lord told him to make other plates and engrave upon them certain instructions for the benefit of his people.  When Nephi became old he gave the plates which contained the records to his brother Jacob and instructed him about what to write on them. Jacob in turn when he grew old gave them to his son. In this way the history of the people was kept for many hundreds of years.  Next to the last man among the Nephites who had charge of the records was one named Mormon. Besides writing an account of what happened in his own time, Mormon made from these records which were on the plates a short history of the people from the days of Lehi to his own time. This history which he wrote is what was translated by Joseph Smith. It is called the Book of Mormon because it was written by Mormon. His son whose name was Moroni was the last man among the Nephites who wrote on the plates. He was also the last prophet that lived among them. When he finished the history the people were fighting and killing each other. They had become wicked and would not obey the commandments of the Lord nor listen to the instructions of His servants the prophets. On this account the Lord allowed them to destroy each other. His prophets Lehi and Nephi said they would be destroyed if they would not serve the Lord.  [Image captioned \"NEPHI MAKING PLATES.\"]  When Moroni finished writing the history of the Nephites he placed the plates containing the records in a stone box and buried them in a hill. With the plates he also placed in the box the sword of Laban which Nephi took to slay Laban with and a gold breastplate such as the people used to protect themselves in war; also the urim and thummim, or interpreters.  This stone box and its contents remained in the ground where it was buried fourteen hundred years. On the 22nd day of September, 1827, this same man Moroni, who had died and was resurrected, or raised to life again, showed Joseph Smith the Prophet where this stone box was buried, and gave him permission to take the plates and other things out.  With the urim and thummim or interpreters, Joseph Smith translated or changed the writings on some of the plates into the English language. In this way the Book of Mormon was given to the people who live in our time. The urim and thummim was two precious stones fastened into a silver rim. They had been prepared by the Lord for the purpose of translating. By looking on these stones the Prophet Joseph Smith could see the English words to be written for the words which were engraved on the plates.  When Nephi became old and knew that he would soon die he anointed a man to be king to rule over the people. He had already appointed his brothers Jacob and Joseph as priests to instruct them in their duties to the Lord. He himself had taught them many things about religion and other matters, and now he was prepared to die. He lived a good life, having been faithful in doing everything the Lord commanded him.
