But when you are where you want to go, then we'll discuss the price....  A hacksaw, he schemed, and a Geiger counter. He had worn his fingers raw trying to find the little button or knob that Harse had used to open them. All right, he was licked there. But there were more ways than one to open a cat's eye.  A hacksaw. A Geiger counter. And, Mooney speculated drowsily, maybe a gun, if the pale-eyed man got tough.  Mooney fell asleep in joy and anticipation for the first time in more than a dozen years.         *       *       *       *       *  It was bright the next morning. Bright and very cold.  \"Look alive!\" Mooney said to the pale-eyed man, shivering. It had been a long walk from Uncle Lester's house to the bridge, in that ripping, shuddering wind that came in off the Atlantic.  Harse got up off his knees, from where he had been examining the asphalt pavement under the snow. He stood erect beside Mooney, while Mooney put on an egg-sucking smile and aimed his thumb down the road.  The station wagon he had spotted seemed to snarl and pick up speed as it whirled past them onto the bridge.  \"I hope you skid into a ditch!\" Mooney bawled into the icy air. He was in a fury. There was a bus line that went where they wanted to go. A warm, comfortable bus that would stop for them if they signaled, that would drop them just where they wanted to be, to convert one of Harse's ball-bearings into money. The gold one, Mooney planned. Not the diamond, not the pearl. Just a few dollars was all they wanted, in this Jersey shore area where the towns were small and the gossip big. Just the price of fare into New York, where they could make their way to Tiffany's.  But the bus cost thirty-five cents apiece. Total, seventy cents. Which they didn't have.  \"Here comes another. Car?\"  Mooney dragged back the corners of his lips into another smile and held out his thumb.  It was a panel truck, light blue, with the sides lettered: _Chris's Delicatessen. Free Deliveries._ The driver slowed up, looked them over and stopped. He leaned toward the right-hand window.  He called: \"I can take you far's Red Ba--\"  He got a good look at Mooney's companion then and swallowed. Harse had put on an overcoat because Mooney insisted on it and he wore a hat because Mooney had told him flatly there would be trouble and questions if he didn't. But he hadn't taken off his own silvery leotard, which peeped through between neck and hat and where the coat flapped open.  \"--ank,\" finished the driver thoughtfully.  Mooney didn't give him a chance to change his mind. \"Red Bank is just where we want to go. Come on!\" Already he had his hand on the door. He jumped in, made room for Harse, reached over him and slammed the door.  \"Thank you very much,\" he said chattily to the driver. \"Cold morning, isn't it? And that was some storm last night. Say, we really do appreciate this. Anywhere in Red Bank will be all right to drop us, anywhere at all.\"  He leaned forward slightly, just enough to keep the driver from being able to get a really good look at his other passenger.  It would have gone all right, it really would, except that just past Fair Haven, Harse suddenly announced: \"It is the time for me to. Eat?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He snip-snapped something around the edges of the gleaming sort of dispatch case, which opened. Mooney, peering over his shoulder, caught glimpses of shiny things and spinning things and things that seemed to glow. So did the driver.  \"Hey,\" he said, interested, \"what've you got there?\"  \"My business,\" said Harse, calmly and crushingly.  The driver blinked. He opened his mouth, and then he shut it again, and his neck became rather red.  Mooney said rapidly: \"Say, isn't there--uh--isn't there a lot of snow?\" He feigned fascination with the snow on the road, leaning forward until his face was nearly at the frosty windshield. \"My gosh, I've never seen the road so snowy!\"  Beside him, Harse was methodically taking things out of other things. A little cylinder popped open and began to steam; he put it to his lips and drank. A cube the size of a fist opened up at one end and little pellets dropped out into a cup. Harse picked a couple up and began to chew them. A flat, round object the shape of a cafeteria pie flipped open and something gray and doughy appeared--  \"Holy heaven!\"  Mooney's face slammed into the windshield as the driver tramped on his brakes. Not that Mooney could really blame him. The smell from that doughy mass could hardly be believed; and what made it retchingly worse was that Harse was eating it with a pearly small spoon.  The driver said complainingly: \"Out! Out, you guys! I don't mind giving you a lift, but I've got hard rolls in the back of the truck and that smell's going to--Out! You heard me!\"  \"Oh,\" said Harse, tasting happily. \"No.\"  \"_No?_\" roared the driver. \"Now listen! I don't have to take any lip from hitchhikers! I don't have to--\"  \"One moment,\" said Harse. \"Please.\" Without hurry and without delay, beaming absently at the driver, he reached into the silvery case again. Snip, snippety-snap; a jointed metal thing wriggled and snicked into place. And Harse, still beaming, pointed it at the driver.  Pale blue light and a faint whine.  It was a good thing the truck was halted, because the whining blue light reached diffidently out and embraced the driver; and then there was no driver. There was nothing. He was gone, beyond the reach of any further lip from hitchhikers.   III  So there was Mooney, driving a stolen panel truck, Mooney the bankrupt, Mooney the ne'er-do-well, and now Mooney the accomplice murderer. Or so he thought, though the pale-eyed man had laughed like a panther when he'd asked.  He rehearsed little speeches all the day down U.S. One, Mooney did, and they all began: \"Your Honor, I didn't know--\"  Well, he hadn't. How could a man like Mooney know that Harse was so bereft of human compassion as to snuff out a life for the sake of finishing his lunch in peace? And what could Mooney have done about it, without drawing the diffident blue glow to himself? No, Your Honor, really, Your Honor, he took me by surprise....  But by the time they ditched the stolen car, nearly dry of gas, at the Hoboken ferry, Mooney had begun to get his nerve back. In fact, he was beginning to perceive that in that glittering silvery dispatch case that Harse hugged to him were treasures that might do wonders for a smart man unjustly dogged by hard times. The wampum alone! But beyond the wampum, the other good things that might in time be worth more than any amount of mere money.  There was that weapon. Mooney cast a glance at Harse, blank-eyed and relaxed, very much disinterested in the crowds of commuters on the ferry.  Nobody in all that crowd would believe that Harse could pull out a little jointed metal thing and push a button and make any one of them cease to exist. Nobody would believe it--not even a jury. Corpus delicti, body of evidence--why, there would _be_ no evidence! It was a simple, workable, foolproof way of getting any desired number of people out of the way without fuss, muss or bother--and couldn't a smart but misfortunate man like Mooney do wonders by selectively removing those persons who stood as obstacles in his path?  And there would be more, much, much more. The thing to do, Mooney schemed, was to find out just what Harse had in that kit and how to work it; and then--who could know, perhaps Harse would himself find the diffident blue light reaching out for him before the intersection of Brooklyn and December twenty-sixth?  Mooney probed.  \"Ah,\" laughed Harse. \"Ho! I perceive what you want. You think perhaps there is something you can use in my survival kit.\"  \"All right, Harse,\" Mooney said submissively, but he did have reservations.  First, it was important to find out just what was in the kit. After that--  Well, even a man from the future had to sleep.         *       *       *       *       *  Mooney was in a roaring rage. How dared the Government stick its bureaucratic nose into a simple transaction of citizens! But it turned out to be astonishingly hard to turn Harse's wampum into money. The first jeweler asked crudely threatening questions about an emerald the size of the ball of his thumb; the second quoted chapter and verse on the laws governing possession of gold. Finally they found a pawnbroker, who knowingly accepted a diamond that might have been worth a fortune; and when they took his first offer of a thousand dollars, the pawnbroker's suspicions were confirmed. Mooney dragged Harse away from there fast.  But they did have a thousand dollars.  As the cab took them across town, Mooney simmered down; and by the time they reached the other side, he was entirely content. What was a fortune more or less to a man who very nearly owned some of the secrets of the future?  He sat up, lit a cigarette, waved an arm and said expansively to Harse: \"Our new home.\"  The pale-eyed man took a glowing little affair with eyepieces away from in front of his eyes.  \"Ah,\" he said. \"So.\"  It was quite an attractive hotel, Mooney thought judiciously. It did a lot to take away the sting of those sordidly avaricious jewelers. The lobby was an impressively close approximation of a cathedral and the bellboys looked smart and able.  Harse made an asthmatic sound. \"What is. That?\" He was pointing at a group of men standing in jovial amusement around the entrance to the hotel's grand ballroom, just off the lobby. They wore purple harem pants and floppy green hats, and every one of them carried a silver-paper imitation of a scimitar.  Mooney chuckled in a superior way. \"You aren't up on our local customs, are you? That's a convention, Harse. They dress up that way because they belong to a lodge. A lodge is a kind of fraternal organization. A fraternal organization is--\"  Harse said abruptly:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51809"],["title","Survival Kit (#2)"],["body"," \"I want.\"  Mooney began to feel alarm. \"What?\"  \"I want one for a. Specimen? Wait, I think I take the big one there.\"  \"Harse! Wait a minute!\" Mooney clutched at him. \"Hold everything, man! You can't do that.\"  Harse stared at him. \"Why?\"  \"Because it would upset everything, that's why! You want to get to your rendezvous, don't you? Well, if you do anything like that, we'll _never_ get there!\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Please,\" Mooney said, \"please take my word for it. You hear me? I'll explain later!\"  Harse looked by no means convinced, but he stopped opening the silvery metal case. Mooney kept an eye on him while registering. Harse continued to watch the conventioneers, but he went no further. Mooney began to breathe again.  \"Thank _you_, sir,\" said the desk clerk--not every guest, even in this hotel, went for a corner suite with two baths. \"Front!\"         *       *       *       *       *  A smart-looking bellboy stepped forward, briskly took the key from the clerk, briskly nodded at Mooney and Harse. With the automatic reflex of any hotel bellhop, he reached for Harse's silvery case. Baggage was baggage, however funny it looked.  But Harse was not just any old guest. The bellboy got the bag away from him, all right, but his victory was purely transitory. He yelled, dropped the bag, grabbed his fist with the other hand.  \"Hey! It shocked me! What kind of tricks are you trying to do with electric suitcases?\"  Mooney moaned softly. The whole lobby was looking at them--even the conventioneers at the entrance to the ballroom; even the men in mufti mingling with the conventioneers, carrying cameras and flash guns; even the very doorman, the whole lobby away. That was bad. What was worse was that Harse was obviously getting angry.  \"Wait, wait!\" Mooney stepped between them in a hurry. \"I can explain everything. My friend is, uh, an inventor. There's some very important material in that briefcase, believe me!\"  He winked, patted the bellhop on the shoulder, took his hand with friendly concern and left in it a folded bill.  \"Now,\" he said confidentially, \"we don't want any disturbance. I'm sure you understand how it is, son. Don't you? My friend can't take any chances with his, uh, confidential material, you see? Right. Well, let's say no more about it. Now if you'll show us to our room--\"  The bellhop, still stiff-backed, glanced down at the bill and the stiffness disappeared as fast as any truck-driver bathed in Harse's pale blue haze. He looked up again and grinned.  \"Sorry, sir--\" he began.  But he didn't finish. Mooney had let Harse get out of his sight a moment too long.  The first warning he had was when there was a sudden commotion among the lodge brothers. Mooney turned, much too late. There was Harse; he had wandered over there, curious and interested and--Harse. He had stared them up and down, but he hadn't been content to stare. He had opened the little silvery dispatch-case and taken out of it the thing that looked like a film viewer; and maybe it was a camera, too, because he was looking through it at the conventioneers. He was covering them as Dixie is covered by the dew, up and down, back and forth, heels to head.  And it was causing a certain amount of attention. Even one of the photographers thought maybe this funny-looking guy with the funny-looking opera glasses was curious enough to be worth a shot. After all, that was what the photographer was there for. He aimed and popped a flash gun.  There was an abrupt thin squeal from the box. Black fog sprayed out of it in a greasy jet. It billowed toward Harse. It collected around him, swirled high. Now all the flashguns were popping....  It was a clear waste of a twenty-dollar bill, Mooney told himself aggrievedly out on the sidewalk. There had been no point in buttering up the bellhop as long as Harse was going to get them thrown out anyway.         *       *       *       *       *  On the other side of the East River, in a hotel that fell considerably below Mooney's recent, brief standards of excellence, Mooney cautiously tipped a bellboy, ushered him out, locked the door behind him and, utterly exhausted, flopped on one of the twin beds.  Harse glanced at him briefly, then wandered over to the window and stared incuriously at the soiled snow outside.  \"You were fine, Harse,\" said Mooney without spirit. \"You didn't do anything wrong at all.\"  \"Ah,\" said Harse without turning. \"So?\"  Mooney sat up, reached for the phone, demanded setups and a bottle from room service and hung up.  \"Oh, well,\" he said, beginning to revive, \"at least we're in Brooklyn now. Maybe it's just as well.\"  \"As well. What?\"  \"I mean this is where you wanted to be. Now we just have to wait four days, until the twenty-sixth. We'll have to raise some more money, of course,\" he added experimentally.  Harse turned and looked at him with the pale eyes. \"One thousand dollars you have. Is not enough?\"  \"Oh, no, Harse,\" Mooney assured him. \"Why, that won't be nearly enough. The room rent in this hotel alone is likely to use that up. Besides all the extras, of course.\"  \"Ah.\" Harse, looking bored, sat down in the chair near Mooney, opened his kit, took out the thing that looked like a film viewer and put it to his eyes.  \"We'll have to sell some more of those things. After all--\" Mooney winked and dug at the pale-eyed man's ribs with his elbow--\"we'll be needing some, well, entertainment.\"  Harse took the viewer away from his eyes. He glanced thoughtfully at the elbow and then at Mooney. \"So,\" he said.  Mooney coughed and changed the subject. \"One thing, though,\" he begged. \"Don't get me in any more trouble like you did in that hotel lobby--or with that guy in the truck. Please? I mean, after all, you're making it hard for me to carry out my job.\"  Harse was thoughtfully silent.  \"Promise?\" Mooney urged.  Harse said, after some more consideration: \"It is not altogether me. That is to say, it is a matter of defense. My picture should not be. Photographed? So the survival kit insures that it is not. You understand?\"  Mooney leaned back. \"You mean--\" The bellboy with the drinks interrupted him; he took the bottle, signed the chit, tipped the boy and mixed himself a reasonably stiff but not quite stupefying highball, thinking hard.  \"Did you say 'survival kit'?\" he asked at last.  Harse was deep in the viewer again, but he looked away from it irritably. \"Naturally, survival kit. So that I can. Survive?\" He went back to the viewer.  Mooney took a long, thoughtful slug of the drink.         *       *       *       *       *  Survival kit. Why, that made sense. When the Air Force boys went out and raided the islands in the Pacific during the war, sometimes they got shot down--and it was enemy territory, or what passed for it. Those islands were mostly held by Japanese, though their populations hardly knew it. All the aboriginals knew was that strange birds crossed the sky and sometimes men came from them. The politics of the situation didn't interest the headhunters. What really interested them was heads.  But for a palatable second choice, they would settle for trade goods--cloth, mirrors, beads. And so the bomber pilots were equipped with survival kits--maps, trade goods, rations, weapons, instructions for proceeding to a point where, God willing, a friendly submarine might put ashore a rubber dinghy to take them off.  Mooney said persuasively: \"Harse. I'm sorry to bother you, but we have to talk.\" The man with the pale eyes took them away from the viewer again and stared at Mooney. \"Harse, were you shot down like an airplane pilot?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Harse frowned--not in anger, or at least not at Mooney. It was the effort to make himself understood. He said at last: \"Yes. Call it that.\"  \"And--and this place you want to go to--is that where you will be rescued?\"  \"Yes.\"  Aha, thought Mooney, and the glimmerings of a new idea began to kick and stretch its fetal limbs inside him. He put it aside, to bear and coddle in private. He said: \"Tell me more. Is there any particular part of Brooklyn you have to go to?\"  \"Ah. The Nexus Point?\" Harse put down the viewer and, snap-snap, opened the gleaming kit. He took out the little round thing he had consulted in the house by the cold Jersey sea. He tilted it this way and that, frowned, consulted a small square sparkly thing that came from another part of the case, tilted the round gadget again.  \"Correcting for local time,\" he said, \"the Nexus Point is one hour and one minute after midnight at what is called. The Vale of Cashmere?\"  Mooney scratched his ear. \"The Vale of Cashmere? Where the devil is that--somewhere in Pakistan?\"  \"Brooklyn,\" said Harse with an imp's grimace. \"You are the guide and you do not know where you are guiding me to?\"  Mooney said hastily: \"All right, Harse, all right. I'll find it. But tell me one thing, will you? Just suppose--suppose, I said--that for some reason or other, we don't make it to the what-you-call, Nexus Point. Then what happens?\"  Harse for once neither laughed nor scowled. The pale eyes opened wide and glanced around the room, at the machine-made candlewick spreads on the beds, at the dusty red curtains that made a \"suite\" out of a long room, at the dog-eared Bible that lay on the night table.  \"Suh,\" he stammered, \"suh--suh--seventeen years until there is another Nexus Point!\"   IV  Mooney dreamed miraculous dreams and not entirely because of the empty bottle that had been full that afternoon. There never was a time, never will be a time, like the future Mooney dreamed of--Mooney-owned, houri-inhabited, a fair domain for a live-wire Emperor of the Eons....  He woke up with a splitting head.  Even a man from the future had to sleep, so Mooney had thought, and it had been in his mind that, even this first night, it might pay to stay awake a little longer than Harse, just in case it might then seem like a good idea to--well, to bash him over the head and grab the bag. But the whiskey had"]]]
