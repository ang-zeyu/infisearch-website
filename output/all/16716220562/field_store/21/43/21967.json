Then he opened it all the way and sent the Vultee streaking straight out along the cross-field runway. He had it off and in the air in no time, climbing smoothly up toward the dawn sun-flooded heavens.  At five thousand he leveled off, circled the field a couple of times in an air salute to Colonel Welsh down on the ground, then dipped his wings and cut around to a crow flight course across the mountains and southeastward to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Not until San Francisco was out of sight behind the tail did he turn around and grin at Freddy.  “Gee, I’m sorry, Freddy,” he said above the roar of the engine in the nose. “I didn’t even give it a thought. But it’s not too late yet. If you want to, it’ll be perfectly okay by me pal.”  The English born youth looked surprised, and then slowly suspicion crawled into his eyes.  “What would be perfectly okay by you?” he demanded. “What didn’t you think of this time?”  “Why, you, of course!” Dave replied as though Freddy should know it. “I didn’t once ask if you’d rather not come along with me. I--I guess I just sort of took it for granted. But I can still skip back, and land, and dump you off, you know.”  No anger showed in Freddy Farmer’s face. He just looked at Dawson in sad sympathy, and sighed heavily.  “Listen to the bloke, will you?” he groaned. “Of all the cheeky ideas he gets. Didn’t ask _me_ if _I’d_ rather not come! Well, I like that. When the truth is that Colonel Welsh said to me, out of your hearing, he said--'I say, Farmer, if you don’t think Dawson would be of any value to you this time--!’”  The English youth cut off the rest and made a little significant gesture. Dave glared daggers at him, and then chuckled.  “Chalk one up for you, pal!” he cried. “I walked into that one with my eyes wide open, and got clipped. Okay. Kidding is off the books from here on in. Have you seen any sign of that agent who is supposed to tag along after us--just in case? He’s flying a Navy Grumman job with Air Corps markings. I saw his ship over on the other side of the field.”  “So did I,” Freddy replied. “But I haven’t seen him since. And I’ve been looking. Perhaps he decided not to get close enough for us to see him. Then the other bloke wouldn’t see him either. I say, Dave, do you really think that baited trap idea will work?”  “I don’t know,” Dawson replied with a scowl. “Right now the hunch department isn’t working. But I hope he does show up. When I think of poor Tracey--”  Dave lifted a hand and slowly closed it into a rock hard fist to indicate the rest of his sentence.  “Quite!” Freddy Farmer echoed, and patted the butts of his rear cockpit guns. “And right now I’m not sure I’d hold my fire if the blighter jumped out with his parachute. But it’s the dirty rotter at the Albuquerque end I’d rather meet. He’s the beggar who really did in poor Tracey.”  “Well, let’s hope this is our lucky day,” Dave said. “Let’s hope we get a good fair crack at both of them, or the six, or the dozen of them, if there are that many!”  With a nod for emphasis, Dave turned front and stared flint-eyed at the banks of clouds that were beginning to pile up above the eastern slopes of the mountain range. After a while the flinty look died out of his eyes, and was replaced by a look of thoughtful speculation. Then suddenly he grinned to himself.  “Guess this is the way with war,” he murmured softly, “at least with Intelligence work. You get faced with a mystery that hasn’t any strings hanging out of it at all. So you grab at what you _hope_ is a string, and follow it through. If you’re lucky, one thing leads to another, and you begin to get results. If you’re not lucky, you get kicked in the face, and most times end up in a hole six feet deep. So here’s hoping Lady Luck is still smiling on Freddy and me!”  “What’s that you said, Dave?” came Freddy Farmer’s voice. “Or is it just this morning sun that makes you mumble in your beard?”  “I haven’t a beard,” Dave slapped back at him. “And besides, I don’t mumble. I was just telling myself that Intelligence work is all pretty much alike. I mean, you start with nothing, and hope you’ll end up with all the correct answers.”  “Absolutely right,” the English youth agreed readily. “And I fancy the insane asylums are full of chaps who took up Intelligence work. I say! Aren’t those mountains beautiful? You certainly do have wonderful scenery over here in America. No wonder you fought so hard in the Revolutionary War.”  It was too perfect an opening for Dave to pass up. He twisted around in the seat and grinned broadly at his closest pal.  “Fought hard?” he echoed scornfully. “Nuts. It was a cinch. Why, I’ve read in history books where the American soldiers only used their right hands. Kept the left ones tied behind their backs.”  Freddy Farmer made a face and stuck his nose in the air in a sniffing gesture. But as soon as he did that he stiffened slightly, narrowed his eyes and peered hard off to the right.  “Look at that plane over there, Dave!” he cried, and pointed. “It’s one of your light plane affairs, one of your two-cylinder Grasshopper ships, as you call them. The chap’s crazy to fly that thing around these mountains. Wind currents can bash him against a slope in no time. However, you Yanks!”  Dave didn’t comment on the last. He had picked out the small plane silhouetted against the towering banks of clouds. It was one of those puddle-jumping Taylor Cubs, and it was dangerously close to the wind and squall-swept mountain sides. He could see it hit air current after air current and bounce about in the rough air like a cork in a heavy sea. The plane reminded him of a swimmer going against the tide. The plane was staggering forward, staggering toward a point that would take it across the Vultee’s path of flight.  “Maybe he’s some guy who got disappointed in love,” Dave ventured the guess aloud. “Or maybe he just doesn’t give a darn. But he seems to be getting clear of the mountains okay. So we should worry. I guess he must have slipped through from the other side. What was that crack about us Yanks?”  “I don’t remember,” Freddy grunted absently. “I wonder about that chap over there, though. What do you suppose he could be doing in among those jagged sloped mountains?”  “I wouldn’t know,” Dave replied with a chuckle. “But being as how you’re such a curious cuss, I’ll ask him when he comes in.”  “Eh?” Freddy echoed.  “Skip it, pal!” Dave laughed. “I was only--Hey! The guy’s in clear air, now, and he’s making a beeline for us. And from here it looks like he’s half standing up and waving at us out the side window.”  “That’s right!” Freddy cried, squinting across the mile or so of air space that separated the two planes. “The blighter is waving his arm off for fair. Now what, I wonder?”  “Search me,” Dave said. “But keep your eyes skinned, Freddy. This may be the beginning of some funny business. It’s up to us to be cagey of even a guy on a bicycle.”  “Have no fear of that!” the English youth said grimly. “But I imagine he’s pretty harmless. Can’t say that I see his dinky little air kite bristling with machine guns.”  “But you can’t see into the cabin!” Dave barked. “So don’t go taking things on face value. Be ready to grab hold of your hat in case he starts pulling something out of the air.”  Dave wasn’t sure whether Freddy snorted or not. Besides, he was too busy watching the small light plane draw closer and closer. A very familiar tingling sensation had come to the back of his neck. It made him a little annoyed to experience the sensation, because it undoubtedly was crazy to think that that little winged sky kite could give the well gunned Vultee any trouble. Still, the feeling was there at the back of the neck, and too many times in the past had it served as the advance warning of trouble for him completely to ignore it. And so he watched the small plane wing in close, but he sat stiff and taut in the seat, and every nerve and muscle was tensed for instantaneous, lightning fast action.  When it got in real close he could see that only the pilot was in the small cabin. There was no passenger in the other seat. For a second his heart looped over, and he got set to bank the Vultee off, when the smaller plane continued to head dead for him. However, in the last moment allowed the light plane swung around until it was flying wing tip to wing tip with the Air Corps ship. Dave automatically eased back the throttle to let the other keep pace, and stared across the air space at the light-complexioned, flaxen-haired man in the Cub’s cabin.  At that moment the Cub’s pilot put his hand out the cabin window, made frantic motions with it and pointed eastward and down.  “He seems to want us to go down, Dave!” Freddy said.  “He’s got another think coming!” Dawson grunted back, and shook his head.  Then on sudden thought he motioned to the Cub pilot to cut his throttle completely, and at the same time eased the Vultee’s Cyclone down to a murmur. Then he shoved back his glass hatch and cupped a hand to his lips.  “What’s the matter?” he roared at the top of his voice.  Both planes were nosing down into a flat glide, but the Vultee was slowly drawing ahead of the butterfly type of plane. The pilot’s voice came to Dawson’s ears as a distant echo.  “Trouble--other side of mountains. Need--help--bad! A crack-up! Need help--bad! My--plane--too--small!”  Dave thought the other pilot shouted something more, but he couldn’t tell for sure because the Vultee had pulled down way ahead of the smaller craft. Still keeping the engine idling, Dave pulled up the nose and hovered close to the stalling point while the Cub pilot used his engine and came up alongside again.  This time the light plane’s pilot almost fell through the cabin window, so wild and frantic were his signals to Dave. And his voice rose as high as the scream of a woman.  “Crash! Crash! People hurt! Need help! Need help! Other side of range! Follow me down. Need help bad!”  “What shall we do, Dave?” came Freddy "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5210"],["title","The Borough (#0)"],["body","by Mark Sherwood, e-mail:  mark.sherwood@btinternet.com     \"THE BOROUGH\", by GEORGE CRABBE (1754-1832) {1}     LETTER I.

This cannot be; yet moved by your request A part I paint--let Fancy form the rest.    Cities and towns, the various haunts of men, Require the pencil; they defy the pen: Could he who sang so well the Grecian fleet, So well have sung of alley, lane, or street? Can measured lines these various buildings show, The Town-Hall Turning, or the Prospect Row? Can I the seats of wealth and want explore, And lengthen out my lays from door to door?    Then let thy Fancy aid me--I repair From this tall mansion of our last year's Mayor, Till we the outskirts of the Borough reach, And these half-buried buildings next the beach, Where hang at open doors the net and cork, While squalid sea-dames mend the meshy work; Till comes the hour when fishing through the tide The weary husband throws his freight aside; A living mass which now demands the wife, Th' alternate labours of their humble life.    Can scenes like these withdraw thee from thy wood, Thy upland forest, or thy valley's flood? Seek then thy garden's shrubby bound, and look, As it steals by, upon the bordering brook; That winding streamlet, limpid, lingering slow, Where the reeds whisper when the zephyrs blow; Where in the midst, upon a throne of green, Sits the large Lily as the water's queen; And makes the current, forced awhile to stay, Murmur and bubble as it shoots away; Draw then the strongest contrast to that stream, And our broad river will before thee seem.    With ceaseless motion comes and goes the tide, Flowing, it fills the channel vast and wide; Then back to sea, with strong majestic sweep It rolls, in ebb yet terrible and deep; Here Samphire-banks and Saltwort bound the flood, There stakes and sea-weeds withering on the mud; And higher up, a ridge of all things base, Which some strong tide has roll'd upon the place.    Thy gentle river boasts its pigmy boat, Urged on by pains, half-grounded, half afloat: While at her stern an angler takes his stand, And marks the fish he purposes to land; From that clear space, where, in the cheerful ray Of the warm sun, the scaly people play. Far other craft our prouder river shows, Hoys, pinks, and sloops:  brigs, brigantines, and snows: Nor angler we on our wide stream descry, But one poor dredger where his oysters lie: He, cold and wet, and driving with the tide, Beats his weak arms against his tarry side, Then drains the remnant of diluted gin, To aid the warmth that languishes within; Renewing oft his poor attempts to beat His tingling fingers into gathering heat.    He shall again be seen when evening comes, And social parties crowd their favourite rooms: Where on the table pipes and papers lie, The steaming bowl or foaming tankard by; 'Tis then, with all these comforts spread around, They hear the painful dredger's welcome sound; And few themselves the savoury boon deny, The food that feeds, the living luxury.    Yon is our Quay! those smaller hoys from town, Its various ware, for country use, bring down; Those laden waggons, in return, impart The country-produce to the city mart; Hark! to the clamour in that miry road, Bounded and narrow'd by yon vessel's load; The lumbering wealth she empties round the place, Package, and parcel, hogshead, chest, and case: While the loud seaman and the angry hind, Mingling in business, bellow to the wind.    Near these a crew amphibious, in the docks, Rear, for the sea, those castles on the stocks: See! the long keel, which soon the waves must hide; See! the strong ribs which form the roomy side; Bolts yielding slowly to the sturdiest stroke, And planks which curve and crackle in the smoke. Around the whole rise cloudy wreaths, and far Bear the warm pungence of o'er-boiling tar. Dabbling on shore half-naked sea-boys crowd, Swim round a ship, or swing upon the shroud; Or in a boat purloin'd, with paddles play, And grow familiar with the watery way: Young though they be, they feel whose sons they are, They know what British seamen do and dare; Proud of that fame, they raise and they enjoy The rustic wonder of the village-boy.    Before you bid these busy scenes adieu, Behold the wealth that lies in public view, Those far extended heaps of coal and coke, Where fresh-fill'd lime-kilns breathe their stifling smoke. This shall pass off, and you behold, instead, The night-fire gleaming on its chalky bed; When from the Lighthouse brighter beams will rise, To show the shipman where the shallow lies.    Thy walks are ever pleasant; every scene Is rich in beauty, lively, or serene - Rich is that varied view with woods around, Seen from the seat within the shrubb'ry bound; Where shines the distant lake, and where appear From ruins bolting, unmolested deer; Lively the village-green, the inn, the place, Where the good widow schools her infant-race. Shops, whence are heard the hammer and the saw, And village-pleasures unreproved by law: Then how serene! when in your favourite room, Gales from your jasmines soothe the evening gloom; When from your upland paddock you look down, And just perceive the smoke which hides the town; When weary peasants at the close of day Walk to their cots, and part upon the way; When cattle slowly cross the shallow brook, And shepherds pen their folds, and rest upon their crook.    We prune our hedges, prime our slender trees, And nothing looks untutor'd and at ease, On the wide heath, or in the flowery vale, We scent the vapours of the sea-born gale; Broad-beaten paths lead on from stile to stile, And sewers from streets the road-side banks defile; Our guarded fields a sense of danger show, Where garden-crops with corn and clover grow; Fences are form'd of wreck, and placed around, (With tenters tipp'd) a strong repulsive bound; Wide and deep ditches by the gardens run, And there in ambush lie the trap and gun; Or yon broad board, which guards each tempting prize, \"Like a tall bully, lifts its head and lies.\"    There stands a cottage with an open door, Its garden undefended blooms before: Her wheel is still, and overturn'd her stool, While the lone Widow seeks the neighb'ring pool: This gives us hope, all views of town to shun - No! here are tokens of the Sailor-son; That old blue jacket, and that shirt of check, And silken kerchief for the seaman's neck; Sea-spoils and shells from many a distant shore, And furry robe from frozen Labrador.    Our busy streets and sylvan-walks between, Fen, marshes, bog, and heath all intervene; Here pits of crag, with spongy, plashy base, To some enrich th' uncultivated space: For there are blossoms rare, and curious rush, The gale's rich balm, and sun-dew's crimson blush, Whose velvet leaf with radiant beauty dress'd, Forms a gay pillow for the plover's breast.    Not distant far, a house commodious made, (Lonely yet public stands) for Sunday-trade; Thither, for this day free, gay parties go, Their tea-house walk, their tippling rendezvous; There humble couples sit in corner-bowers, Or gaily ramble for th' allotted hours; Sailors and lasses from the town attend, The servant-lover, the apprentice-friend; With all the idle social tribes who seek And find their humble pleasures once a week.    Turn to the watery world!--but who to thee (A wonder yet unview'd) shall paint--the Sea? Various and vast, sublime in all its forms, When lull'd by zephyrs, or when roused by storms, Its colours changing, when from clouds and sun Shades after shades upon the surface run; Embrown'd and horrid now, and now serene, In limpid blue, and evanescent green; And oft the foggy banks on ocean lie, Lift the fair sail, and cheat th' experienced eye.    Be it the summer--noon:  a sandy space The ebbing tide has left upon its place; Then just the hot and stony beach above, Light twinkling streams in bright confusion move; (For heated thus, the warmer air ascends, And with the cooler in its fall contends) Then the broad bosom of the ocean keeps An equal motion; swelling as it sleeps, Then slowly sinking; curling to the strand, Faint, lazy waves o'ercreep the rigid sand, Or tap the tarry boat with gentle blow, And back return in silence, smooth and slow. Ships in the calm seem anchor'd; for they glide On the still sea, urged solely by the tide: Art thou not present, this calm scene before, Where all beside is pebbly length of shore, And far as eye can reach, it can discern no more?    Yet sometimes comes a ruffing cloud to make The quiet surface of the ocean shake; As an awaken'd giant with a frown Might show his wrath, and then to sleep sink down.    View now "]]]
