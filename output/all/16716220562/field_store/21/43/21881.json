It might, for example, be urged that if a man strive after the achievement of a transcendental ideal in which self shall be annulled, he will _pro tanto [to such extent]_ be bringing welfare to his domestic circle; or again, that it would be impossible to promote domestic welfare without, through this, promoting the welfare of the nation, and through that the general welfare of the world.  In like manner it might be argued that all work done for abstract principles of morality like liberty and justice, for the advancement of knowledge, and for whatever else goes to the building up of a higher civilisation, will, by promoting the welfare of the general body of mankind, redound to the advantage of each several nation, and ultimately to the advantage of each domestic circle.  But all this would be true only in a very superficial and strictly qualified sense. In reality, just as there is eternal conflict between egoism and altruism, so there is conflict between the different moralities.  To take examples, the attempt to actualise the transcendental religious ideal may, when pursued with ardour, very easily conflict with the morality which makes domestic felicity its end. And again--as we see in the anti-militarist movement in France, in the history of the early Christian Church, in the case of the Quakers and in the teachings of Tolstoy--it may quite well set itself in conflict with national ideals, and dictate a line of conduct which is, from the point of view of the State, immoral.  We need no further witness of the divorce between idealistic and national morality than that which is supplied in the memorable utterance of Bishop Magee, \"No state which was conducted on truly Christian principles could hold together for a week.\"  And domestic morality will constantly come into conflict with public morality.  To do everything in one's power to advance one's relatives and friends irrespectively of all considerations of merit would, no doubt, be quite sound domestic morality; it could, however, not always be reconciled with public morality. In the same way, to take one's country's part in all eventualities would be patriotic, but it might quite well conflict with the higher interests of humanity.  Now, the point towards which we have been winning our way is that each man's moral station and degree will be determined by the election which he makes where egoism and altruism, and where a narrower and a wider code of morality, conflict.  That the moral law forbids yielding to the promptings of egoism or to those of the narrower moralities when this involves a violation of the precepts of the wider morality is axiomatic. Criminal and anti-social actions are not excused by the fact that motives which impelled their commission were not purely egoistic.  But the ethical law demands more than abstention from definitely anti-social actions. It demands from every individual that he shall recognise the precepts of public morality as of superior obligation to those of egoism and domestic morality.  By the fact that her public men recognised this ethical law Rome won for herself in the ancient world spectacular grandeur. By an unexampled national obedience to it glory has in our time accrued to Japan. And, in truth, there is not anywhere any honour or renown but such as comes from casting away the bonds of self and of the narrower moralities to carry out the behests of the wider morality.  Even in the strongholds of transcendental religion where it was axiomatic that morality began and was summed up in personal morality, it is gradually coming to be recognised that, where we have two competing moralities, it is always the wider morality which has the prior claim upon our allegiance.  Kingsley's protest against the morality of \"saving one's dirty soul\" marked a step in advance. And we find full recognition of the superior claim of the larger morality in that other virile dictum of Bishop Magee, \"I would rather have England free, than England sober.\" That is, \"I would maintain the conditions which make for the highest civilisation even at the price of a certain number of lapses in personal and domestic morality.\"  What is here new, let it be noted, is only the acknowledgment by those whose official allegiance is to a transcendental ideal of personal morality that they are called upon to obey a higher allegiance. For there has always existed, in the doctrine that guilty man could not be pardoned and taken back into favour until the claims of eternal justice had been satisfied, theoretical recognition of the principle that one must conform to the precepts of abstract morality before one may ethically indulge oneself in the lower moralities of philanthropy and personal benevolence.  The view point from which I would propose to survey the morality of woman has now been reached. It has, however, still to be pointed out that we may appropriately, in comparing the morals of man and woman, confine our survey to a comparatively narrow field. That is to say, we may here rule out all that relates to purely personal and domestic morality--for this is not relevant to the suffrage. And we may also rule out all that relates to offences against the police laws--such as public drunkenness and offences against the criminal law--for these would come into consideration only in connexion with an absolutely inappreciable fraction of voters.  It will be well to begin by signalising certain points in the moral psychology of man.  When morality takes up its abode in a man who belongs to the intellectual caste it will show itself in his becoming mindful of his public obligations. He will consider the quality of his work as affecting the interest of those who have to place dependence upon it; behaviour to those who are casually brought into relations with him; the discharge of his indebtedness to the community; and the proper conduct of public affairs.  In particular, it will be to him a matter of concern that the law shall be established upon classifications which are just (in the sense of being conformable to public advantage); and that the laws shall everywhere be justly, that is to say rigorously and impartially, administered.  If we now turn to the man in the street we shall not find him especially sensible to the appeals of morality. But when the special call comes it will generally be possible to trust him: as an elector, to vote uninfluenced by considerations of private advantage; and, when called to serve on a jury, to apply legal classifications without distinction of person.  Furthermore, in all times of crisis he may be counted upon to apply the principles of communal morality which have been handed down in the race.  The _Titanic_ disaster, for example, showed in a conspicuous manner that the ordinary man will, \"letting his own life go,\" obey the communal law which lays it upon him, when involved in a catastrophe, to save first the women and children.  Lastly, we come to the man who is intolerant of all the ordinary restraints of personal and domestic morality. Even in him the seeds of communal morality will often be found deeply implanted.  Time and again a regiment of scallawags, who have let all other morality go hang, have, when the proper chord has been made to vibrate in them, heard the call of communal morality, and done deeds which make the ears of whosoever heareth of them to tingle.  We come into an entirely different land when we come to the morality of woman. It is personal and domestic, not public, morality which is instinctive in her.  In other words, when egoism gives ground to altruism, that altruism is exercised towards those who are linked up to her by a bond of sexual affection, or a community in blood, or failing this, by a relation of personal friendship, or by some other personal relation.  And even when altruism has had her perfect work, woman feels no interest in, and no responsibility towards, any abstract moral ideal.  And though the suffragist may protest, instancing in disproof of this her own burning enthusiasm for justice, we, for our part, may legitimately ask whether evidence of a moral enthusiasm for justice would be furnished by a desire to render to others their due, or by vehement insistence upon one's own rights, and systematic attempts to extort, under the cover of the word \"justice,\" advantages for oneself.  But it will be well to dwell a little longer on, and to bring out more clearly, the point that woman's moral ideals are personal and domestic, as distinguished from impersonal and public.  Let us note in this connexion that it would be difficult to conceive of a woman who had become deaf to the appeal of personal and domestic morality making it a matter of _amour propre_ to respond to a call of public morality; and difficult to conceive of a woman recovering lost self-respect by fulfilling such an obligation.  But one knows that woman will rise and respond to the call of any strong human or transcendental personal affection.  Again, it is only a very exceptional woman who would, when put to her election between the claims of a narrow and domestic and a wider or public morality, subordinate the former to the latter.  In ordinary life, at any rate, one finds her following in such a case the suggestions of domestic--I had almost called it animal--morality.  It would be difficult to find any one who would trust a woman to be just to the rights of others in the case where the material interests of her children, or of a devoted husband, were involved. And even to consider the question of being in such a case intellectually just to any one who came into competition with personal belongings like husband and child would, of course, lie quite beyond the moral horizon of ordinary woman.  It is not only the fact that the ideals of abstract justice and truth would inevitably be brushed aside by woman in the interests of those she loves which comes into consideration here; it is also the fact that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51832"],["title","The Place Where Chicago Was (#0)"],["body","PLACE WHERE CHICAGO WAS                               By JIM HARMON                           Illustrated by COWLES             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                     Galaxy Magazine February 1962.

For the first              time there was peace on Earth--since the only              possible victims were the killers themselves!   It was late December of 1983. Abe Danniels knew that the streets and sidewalks of Jersey City moved under their own power and that half the families in America owned their own helicopters. He was pleased with these signs of progress. But he was sweating. He thought he was getting athlete's foot instead of athletic legs from walking from the New Jersey coast to just outside of Marshall, Illinois.  The heat was unbearable.  The road shimmered before him in rows of sticky black ribbon, on which nothing moved. Nothing but him.  He passed a signal post that said \"Caution--Slow\" in a gentle but commanding voice. He staggered on toward a reddish metallic square set on a thin column of bluish concrete. It was what they called a sign, he decided.  Danniels drooped against the sign and fanned his face with his sweat-ringed straw cowboy hat. The thing seemed to have something to say about the mid-century novelist, James Jones, in short, terse words.  The rim of the hat crumpled in his fist. He stood still and listened.  There _was_ a car coming.  It would almost _have_ to stop, he reasoned. A man couldn't stand much of this Illinois winter heat. The driver might leave him to die on the road if he didn't stop. Therefore he would stop.  He jerked out the small pouch from the sash of his jeans. Inside the special plastic the powder was dry. He rubbed some between his hands briskly, to build up the static electricity, and massaged it into his hair.  The metal of the Jones plaque was fairly shiny. Under the beating noon sun it cast a pale reflection back at Danniels. His hair looked a reasonably uniform white now.  He started to draw the string on the pouch, then dipped his hand in and scooped his palm up to his mouth. He chewed on the stuff while he was securing the nearly flat bag in his sash. He swallowed the dough; the powder had been flour.  Danniels took the hat from beneath his arm, set it to his head and at last faced the direction of the engine whine.  The roof, hood and wheels moved over the curve of the horizon and Danniels saw that the car was a brandless classic which probably still had some of the original, indestructible Model A left in it.  He pondered a moment on whether to thumb or not to thumb.  He thumbed.  The rod squealed to a stop exactly even with him. A door unfolded and a voice like a stop signal said flatly, \"Get in.\"  Danniels got in. The driver was a teen-ager in a loose scarlet tunic and a spangled W.P.A. cap. The youth wouldn't have been bad-looking except for a sullen expression and a rather girlish turn of cheek, completely devoid of beard line. Danniels wrote him off as a prospective member of the Wolf Pack in a year or two.  But not just yet, he fervently hoped.  \"Going far? I'm not,\" said the driver.  Danniels adjusted the knees of his trousers. \"I'm going to--near where Chicago used to be.\"  \"Huh?\"  Danniels had forgotten the youth of his companion. \"I mean I'm going to where you can't go any further.\"  The driver nodded smugly, relieved that the threat to the vastness of his knowledge had been dismissed. \"I get you, Pop. I guess I can take you close to where you're headed.\"  They rode on in silence, both relieved that they didn't have to try to span the void between age and position with words.  \"You aren't anywhere near starvation, are you?\" the driver said suddenly, uneasy.  \"No,\" Danniels said. \"Anyway I've got money.\"  \"Woodrow Wilson! I'll pull in at the next joint.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The next joint was carved out of the flat cross-section of hill that looked unmistakably like a strip ridge of a Colorado copper mine, but wasn't ... even barring the fact that this was Illinois. The rectangle of visible dinner was color-fused aluminum from between No. Two and Korea.  Danniels was glad to get into the shockingly cold air-conditioning. It was constant, if unhealthy. The chugging unit in the car failed a heartbeat every now and then for a sickening wave of heat.  The two of them pulled up wire chairs to a linoleum-top table in a mirrored corner. A faint purple hectographed menu was stuck between appropriately colored plastic squeeze bottles labeled MUSTARD and BLOOD.  Danniels knew what the menu would say but he unfolded it and checked.      _Steaks_      Plankton .90      Juicy, rich-red tantalizing hamburger .17       _Accessories_      Mashed potatoes .40      Delectable oysters, all you can eat .09      Peas .35      Rich, fragrant cheese, large slice .02       _Drinks_      Coke .50      Milk, the forbidden wine of nature .01      Coffee (without) .50      Coffee (with) .02  A fat girl in white came to the table.  Danniels tossed the menu on the table. \"I'll take the meat dinner,\" he said.  The teen-ager stared hard at the table top. \"So will I.\"  \"Good citizens,\" the waitress said, but the revulsion crept into her voice over the professional hardness.  Danniels looked carefully at his companion. \"You aren't used to ordering meat.\"  \"Pop,\" the youth began. Danniels waited to be told that being short of cash was none of his business. \"Pop, on my leg. Kill it, kill it!\"  Danniels leaned over the table startled and curious. A cockroach was feeling its way along a thin meridian of vari-colored jeans. Danniels pinched it up without injuring it and deposited it on the floor. It scurried away.  \"Your kind make me sick,\" the driver said in lieu of thanks. \"You act like a Fanatic but you're a Meat-Eater. How do you blesh that?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Danniels shrugged. He did not have to explain anything to this kid. He couldn't be stranded.  The kid was under the same encephalographic inversion as the rest of the world. No human being could directly or indirectly commit murder, as long as the broadcasting stations every nation on earth maintained in self-defense continued to function.  These mechanical brain waves coated every mind with enforced pacifism. They could have just as easily broadcast currents that would have made minds swell with love or happiness. But world leaders had universally agreed that these conditions were too narcotic for the common people to endure.  Pacifism was vital to the survival of the planet.  War could not go on killing; but governments still had to go on winning wars. War became a game. The International War Games were held every two years. With pseudo-H bombs and mock-germ warfare, countries still effectively eliminated cities and individuals. A \"destroyed\" city was off-limits for twenty years. Nothing could go in or out for that period. Most cities had provided huge food deposits for emergencies.  Before the Famine.  Some minds were more finely attuned to the encephalographic inversion than others. People so in tune with the wavelength of pacifism could not only not kill another human being, they could not even kill an animal. Vegetarianism was thrust upon a world not equipped for it. Some--like Danniels--who could not kill, still found themselves able to eat what others had killed. Others who could not kill or eat _any_ once-living thing--even plants--rapidly starved to death. They were quickly forgotten.  Almost as forgotten as the Jonahs.  The War Dead.  Any soldier or civilian \"killed\" outside of a major disaster area (where he would be subject to the twenty years) became a man without a country--or a world. They were tagged with green hair by molecular exchange and sent on their way to starve, band together, reach a disaster area (where they would be accepted for the duration of the disaster), or starve.  Anyone who in any way communicated with a Jonah or even recognized the existence of one automatically became a Jonah himself.  It was harsh. And if it wasn't better than war it was quieter.  And more permanent.  The counterman with a greasy apron and hairy forearms served the plates. The meat had been lightly glazed to bring out the aroma and flavor but the blood was still a pink sheen on the ground meat. There were generous side dishes of cheese and milk. Even animal by-products were passed up by the majority of vegetarians. Eggs had been the first to be dropped--after all, every egg was a potential life. Milk and associated products came to be spurned through sheer revulsion by association. Besides, milk was intended only to feed the animal's own offspring, wasn't it?         *       *       *       *       *  Danniels squirted blood generously from its squeeze bottle. Even vegetarians used a lot of it. It gave their plankton the gory look the human animal craved. Of course it was not really blood, only a kind of tomato paste. When Danniels had been a boy people called it catsup.  He tried to dig into his steak with vengeance but it tasted of ashes. Meat was his favorite food; he was in no way a vegetarian. But the thought of the Famine haunted him. Vegetable food was high in price and ration points. Most people were living on 2500 calories a day. It wasn't quite starvation and it wasn't quite a full stomach. It was hard on anybody who did more than an average amount of work. It was especially hard on children.  The Meat-Eaters helped relieve the situation. Some, with only the minimum of influence from the Broadcasters, ate nothing but meat. They were naturally aggressive morons who were doing no one favors, potential members of a Wolf Pack.  Danniels knew how to end the Famine.  The mob that was the men he had commanded had hunted him in the hills below Buffalo, and he had "]]]
