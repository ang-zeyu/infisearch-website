As a result of the visionary experiment by this daring young man, fifty thousand idle construction workers have already been put back on the job; twenty new banks have sprung up to handle the flood of mortgages; a new steel mill will be erected in our world-famous game preserve. But I need not go on. The industries, businesses and stock markets that will profit by Senseless Destruction can hardly be numbered. The biggest boom in history is on! And as long as we have the snooker it will never end!\" (General pandemonium.)  When order was restored, the mayor turned solemnly to George and said: \"In grateful recognition of your....\"  After the recognition speech George accepted humbly the following sums, not listing gifts under $10,000:  $10,000 from Home Builders Assn.  $12,500 from Construction Union, Local 256.  $15,000 from Last Bank of America.  $11,276.88 from Unified Steel Corp.  $20,00 from Chicago Furniture Mart.  $10,000 from Congress in Series E Bonds.  George also received the following appointments:  Special Adviser to Mayor on Senseless Destruction, with nominal yearly income of $75,000 tax free.  Vice-President of Trojan Life & Casualty Co.  Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Sunnydale Game and Wood Preserve.  Honorary Supreme Commander of Juvenile Senseless Destructionists, to be organized.         *       *       *       *       *  A year later George sat wearily in the control room of his chateau on Indian Rock overlooking the town. Snookers buzzed over rooftops like flies. Clouds of dust rose prosperously everywhere. In the streets construction gangs raced in speed trucks.  George had begun to wonder how it would all end.  After the novelty had worn off, Senseless Destruction became more monotonous, more depressing than the Installment Way of Life before it. People worked harder than ever now and had less to show for it. Of course, it was unpatriotic to have anything to show for it. Nobody in his right senses would argue against Round-the-Clock Employment for All. And if you didn't go around grinning and saying how happy you were with your seventh mortgage, people began to suspect you.  George had talked it all over with Rosy and she agreed. Sure, it was all right for _them_--for the time being. But George had begun to despise himself.  He had to keep sharp control over the snookers. Some of them showed a tendency to sneak off course, looking for some nice fresh target--like the chateau, maybe.  The butler came in and presented a calling card on a silver platter.  \"Vernher! Show him in at once.\"  Vernher von Wissenschaft marched in, cracking his Rommel whip. He looked worried.  \"Bad news,\" Vernher said, shaking hands. \"Chust come from the President.\"  \"How _is_ Charlie?\"  \"Goot. But too much work. And trouble. These snookers.\" Vernher strode to the window and looked out over the town.  \"They're doing a fine job,\" George assured him.  Vernher turned. A grim smile slashed his face. \"Too goot. Russian economy caught up with ours. They vant snookers too. Must have snookers or they go kaput.\"  \"What's so bad about that? Let them go kaput. Cold war will be over at least.\"  Vernher shook his head. \"They threaten atomic war if they don't get snookers. This time for real.\"         *       *       *       *       *  George gave a low whistle.  \"_Ja_,\" Vernher sighed. \"Charlie had secret cabinet meeting. We cannot take chance. You must go teach them how.\"  \"Can't you go?\"  \"I'm leaving for Johannesburg tonight. United Africa also caught up.\"  \"As it is our economy barely keeps ahead of the Russians!\"  \"_Ja._ But cannot be helped.\"  \"Maybe,\" George said, \"if you invented something bigger, better, more efficient.\"  \"You think I haf not tried?\"  George stood thinking a long moment. He said, \"Vernher, is there no way out?\"  \"Sure,\" Vernher laughed. \"If we go back to savage pre-civilization.\"  \"All right,\" George said. \"I'll go tell Rosy. Watch the control panel a moment, will you? Especially the Eastern Section.\"  \"What's the matter with them?\"  \"They seem to be getting restless lately.\"  \"Nonsense! My snookers haf no emotions.\"  \"Just seems that way sometimes,\" George said, going out. Their job could even make stones feel something, he thought.  He ran down to Rosy in the kitchen. She had consented to having servants only because of her social position, but she still insisted on personally running the kitchen her own way.  George pulled her into the hallway and put his arms around her and kissed her.  \"What on earth?\" she said.  \"You must be very brave, darling.\" He fixed her with his eyes. \"Rosy, this is _it_.\"  \"It?\"  \"E-Day.\"  E for Escape.  \"We can't talk now,\" he said. \"Vernher is at the controls.\"  \"Can I change?\"  \"No time. Are the suitcases packed?\"  \"They're in the garage, behind the beer barrels.\"  \"Go get Timmy,\" George said. \"I'll drive the station wagon round to the back door.\"  At the gate to the grounds they stopped and took a last look at the chateau. They could see Vernher standing in the control window. He seemed to be enjoying the spectacle in the town below.  Rosy gripped George's arm. \"Look!\"  A snooker had strayed off its orbit and was hissing in toward the chateau. It came fast over the grounds, heading straight for the control window.  Vernher never saw it coming. Probably he did not even hear the glass crashing as the sharp slivers shot into the room.         *       *       *       *       *  By the end of May George was still chopping a small clearing in the Montana woods. George and Charlie's old campsite. It was harder work than he'd expected. But it was a good site and the tent would be replaced by a heavy log cabin before winter set in. Sometimes they'd climb one of the peaks on the Flathead Range and sit gazing at Hungry Horse Reservoir in the distance.  The trees were stubborn here, blunting the ax. But they'd make it all right. George sat down to rest.  Rosy waved to him from the potato patch. A strand of smoke rose peacefully from the stone oven. He waved back and grinned.  Timmy worked his way up bravely to where George sat. He'd gotten used to his bark shoes and had quite forgotten that he had ever worn any other kind.  \"Can I help you, Daddy?\"  Education too, George thought. The _real_ kind. \"No, thanks, son,\" he said. \"You'd better help your mother plant the potatoes.\"  That evening at supper, as they sat enjoying sundown and the quiet of woods and mountains, they heard a motor far away. The wind took it away and then it sounded much nearer, grinding in low gear. George stood up as a jeep came round the mountain. In it sat a man and a woman.  The jeep came into the clearing, swaying over stones and roots.  \"Charlie!\"  \"Hi,\" Charlie said. He helped Beth down.  George yanked Timmy to his feet. \"Stand up, son. This is the President of the United States.\"  \"I got a present for you, George,\" Charlie said.  \"Not another pressure cooker!\" Rosy said.  \"A peace pipe,\" Charlie said.  Timmy's big round eyes took him in. \"Are _you_ the President?\" he asked in a small, awed voice.  \"Not any more,\" Charlie said.  George stared at him. \"You didn't give up the White House?\"  \"What else could I do?\" Charlie said. \"I gave it back to the Indians.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51571"],["title","Subject to Change (#0)"],["body","TO CHANGE                              BY RON GOULART                           Illustrated by HARMAN             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                     Galaxy Magazine December 1960.

The airport taxi left him at his place, where he showered and shaved. Then he decided he would walk, down through Chinatown and over into North Beach, to Beth's apartment.  It was a warm Saturday afternoon and he unbuttoned his dacron blazer a block or so into Chinatown. He smiled as he wandered by the bright restaurants and shops, the rows of ivory Buddhas in window after window. On one corner Pendleton stopped and took a deep breath, watching a scattering of tourists taking pictures of each other. Someone had lost a half dozen fortune cookies on the sidewalk and they crackled and spread fragments and fortunes as people passed.  While he was waiting for a signal to change, three small Chinese boys charged a fourth who had ducked around Pendleton. They all ran around the corner and Pendleton looked after them. There was an old curio and toy shop there. He went toward its streaked window, trying to identify the objects. Some kind of procession of tin soldiers made up the main display. The door of the shop opened and an old man with a flared white beard came out. His dark suit hung loose on him and his tie was coming untied as he hurried away.  The old man brushed by Pendleton, nudging him. \"Many pardons,\" he said, cutting across the street. He ran downhill, weaving a little, and into an alley.  The bells over the toy shop door rattled again. \"Stop, thief!\" shouted the fat Chinese, who came running up to Pendleton. The man shouted again and stopped on the corner, his hands on his hips, looking.  Pendleton crossed the street and turned down the alley the old man had used. This would cut off a block of the way to Beth's. He had kept quiet about the thief because he didn't want to get involved in a lot of delaying questioning.         *       *       *       *       *  Halfway down the alley he saw an arm dangling out of a garbage can. Pendleton blinked and approached the shadowed area around the can. He flipped the lid up and the coat sleeve that had been tangled on the can edge slipped free and dropped into the can. If the old man was wandering around naked, they shouldn't have much trouble catching him.  Pendleton liked the pre-quake apartment house Beth lived in. In almost any weather he liked to see its narrow brown wood front waiting there in the middle of the block. He smiled as a big blue-gray gull flew low overhead and then circled up and away behind Beth's building. Pendleton took the rough steps in twos and threes and swung at Beth's bell. There was a folded note for him glued on her mail box lid with Scotch tape. It told him she might be delayed a bit and to get her keys from under the rubber-plant pot on the porch and let himself in. He did that, thinking again that Beth's notes always looked as though she wrote them on horseback.  Upstairs he dropped her keys on the small mantle over the small real fireplace. Her bedroom door was slightly open. Just as he noticed this, Beth called out to him.  \"I hope that's you, Ben?\" she said from her room.  \"Where'll I put the ice, lady?\" he said. \"You're supposed to be out.\"  \"Welcome back. I just got here and I had to change so I left the keys down there in case you got here while I was changing. How was New York?\"  \"Okay, but I'm glad I'm with the agency out here. How'd you get in without keys?\" He sat down in the soft tan sofa-chair he'd given her.  \"I have a key to the kitchen way. Is the show all right now?\"  \"I guess we fixed it for a while. How are you?\"  \"Fine. And, hey, I have a good part in Alex' new play. It just happened and I couldn't write.\"  \"You have lousy handwriting, you know,\" Pendleton called. Grinning, he got out a cigarette and reached into his coat pocket for a book of matches. Something jabbed into the palm of his hand.  \"It's because I'm so intense,\" Beth said, near her bedroom door.  Pendleton winced and pulled a small toy Chinese junk out of the pocket. The price stamp was still on the bottom of the boat, 25 cents. The old man must have dropped it in his pocket when he nudged him.  Beth came up behind him. \"It's warm in here. Give me your coat. I have a whole new concept about making martinis. This fellow in Actors' Lab told me. You do it with Zen.\" Her hands rested on Pendleton's shoulders.  \"I'll be damned,\" he said, rubbing his palm with the boat as he stood.  Beth slid her arms over his shoulders and locked her hands on his chest. \"What's that, Ben?\"  Pendleton turned around in her hold. He tapped her tanned nose with the toy boat and told her about it. \"I suppose I should take it back,\" he said finally.  Beth laughed. \"Makes you a receiver of stolen goods.\" She took the toy boat and walked to the fireplace. She put it next to her keys and turned to him. She was wearing a light blue dress with a flared skirt. No stockings, flat black shoes. She'd cut her blonde hair short since he'd seen her last. \"Welcome back,\" she said, smiling.         *       *       *       *       *  A light wind was starting up, tapping windows with tree branches, as Pendleton let himself into Beth's darkening apartment. He flipped the light switch on and started for the tan sofa chair, jiggling the keys in his hand. The bedroom door slammed.  \"You in there?\" Pendleton called. Her note said she'd gone out for some forgotten groceries.  Pendleton opened the bedroom door and turned on the lights. The window beyond Beth's low, blue-covered bed was open and the wind was flapping the curtains against her dressing table. A strong flap caught a lipstick and flipped it into the thick rug.  Edging around the bed, Pendleton closed the window and picked up the lipstick. He left the bedroom door a bit open and went back to the chair. There was a paper back by Eisenstein on the coffee table and he picked that up and read down the contents page.  The wind got stronger and parts of the old building creaked, first something down under him, then something way up and to the right. Now and then there would be a bang from out in back. Pendleton dropped the book and got down on his knees in front of the fireplace and kindled a fire. As the fire took hold, bright sparks popped out into the room.  Something started tapping on the window behind Pendleton's chair. At last, in a lull between creaking and banging, he became aware of a tapping. He looked at the window and the early night sky. The tapping went on.  There was a gray cat sitting on the sill outside. The cat was tangled up in an orange and blue bead necklace. \"Lonely out there,\" Pendleton said. He didn't much like cats, but this one looked sad. He opened the window and the cat jumped in, the necklace falling free and clattering against the wall. \"We'll see if maybe Beth's got something around to give to wandering cats.\" Pendleton reached out to pick up the cat. Sputtering, the animal raked at his fingers and dived between his legs.  Pendleton spun and saw the cat scoot through the open bedroom door. \"Hey, you little bastard, you'll knock over things.\"  He was two steps from the door when it slammed and locked. Pendleton stopped, wondering how the animal had managed to bang into the door hard enough to close it. He didn't think the cat should stay in there and anyway Beth would want to get in when she got home. He'd pick the lock. Crouching, he reached for the knob. Something clicked and the door swung in. He recognized Beth's terry robe and he looked up and saw her face, very pale.  \"Okay,\" she said. \"I guess I was too cute with the key bits. Go away, Ben, and leave me alone. Please?\"  \"What's the matter?\" He was still squatting and her stepping forward sent him over.  \"Just go away, Ben. Please, now.\" She brushed by him and sat in a bucket chair, putting both bare feet down hard on the floor.  Ben got himself up. \"You drunk?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Beth brushed at her hair. \"I thought if you were sitting out here and I showed up in the bedroom, you'd think I came in the back way. Or that I was already in there and just hadn't heard you.\" She bit her thumb. \"Just another trick I wanted to try.\"  \"What are you talking about?\" He bent and scooped up the bead necklace.  \"Go away. That's all.\"  \"Well, why?\" He twisted the string of beads around his knuckles. \"Somebody else?\"  \"Yes. Alex.\" She smiled.  \"Alex? That fruiter who runs the Actors' Lab.\" The string broke and beads splattered away from him. Three landed in the fire.  \"Or maybe my Uncle Russ. Did you know we lived with him for three years when I was a kid and I was always having odd fevers and things? He had some kind of quack x-ray business.\"  Pendleton took Beth's shoulders. \"You're sick, is that it?\"  \"No. Go away, Ben.\"  \"Well, what is it?\"  Beth sighed, annoyed. \"You know about Method. You have to feel the parts, live them.\"  \"Sure.\"  Beth shrugged her shoulders until Pendleton let go. \"One weekend afternoon--oh, about two or three weeks after the agency sent you off--I was here trying to be an old lady. For an exercise at the Lab. And I was.\"  Pendleton blinked at her still pale fact. \"That's swell, Beth. A guy likes to know what his fiancee is up to while he's away.\"  \"I _was_ an old lady.\" She stood with her body thrust almost against him. \"See? I changed.\"  He backed a little. \"How about a drink?\"  \"Don't you get it, Ben? How the hell do you think I just came in?\"  \"The back way.\" Pendleton decided to try a drink on her and then find out who her doctor was these days.  \"I was the cat. Now you know about it and can go away, Ben.\" She let herself fall to the floor and she huddled there, crying.  \"How long have you had this idea?\" He knelt "]]]
