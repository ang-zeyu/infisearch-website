It was a set of scales held by a giant hand. In one pan of the scales sat a smiling man. In the other was a small heap of ashes.  \"Have you,\" asked the bored man, \"to the best of your knowledge, committed any wrong or illegal act or acts since your last vacation?\"  He readied the dustpan and whiskbroom.  The Milbuns watched anxiously at a door in the back of the room.  Uneasily, Dan thought back and remembered no wrong or illegal acts he had committed since his last vacation.  \"No,\" he said.  The functionary stepped back. \"Pass through to your vacation, live law-abiding citizen, sir.\"  Dan got up and walked toward the Milbuns. Another bored functionary came in wheeling a cartful of urns. He stopped at a massive chair with a heap of ashes on the seat, a small pile on either arm, and two small piles at the foot. The functionary swept the ashes off and dumped them in the urn.  A cold sensation went through Dan. He followed the Milbuns out into a small room.  He felt an out-of-focus sensation and realized the room was a mataform transmitter. An instant later, they were in a spaceship crowded with thoughtful-looking people.         *       *       *       *       *  Life on the spaceship seemed to be given over to silent, morose meditation, with an occasional groan that sounded very much like, \"Oh, give me just one more chance, God.\"  When they left the ship, it was again by mataform, this time to a building where they stood in a line of people. The line wound through a booth where the color of their capes was marked on their foreheads, thence past a counter where they received strong khaki-colored capes, blouses and hose, and new leather shorts and boots to replace those they were wearing. They changed in tiny private rooms, handed their own clothing in at another counter, had a number stamped on their left shoulders and on their boxes of clothing.  Then they walked out onto a strip of brilliant white sand, fronting on an inlet of sparkling blue water.  Here and there huddled little crowded knots of people, dancing from one foot to another on the hot sand and yet apparently afraid to go in the water. Dan looked to the Milbuns for some clue and saw them darting intense calculating glances at the beach and the water.  Then Mr. Milbun yelled, \"_Run for it!_\"  A slavering sound reached Dan's ear. He sprinted after the Milbuns, burst through the crowd in a headlong bolt for the cove, then swam as fast as he could to keep up with them as they raced for the opposite shore. They crawled out, strangling and gasping, and dragged themselves up on the sand. Dan lay, heaving in deep breaths, then rolled over and sat up.  The air around them was split by screams, laced through with sobs, curses and groans. On the shore opposite, a mad dog darted across the crowded beach and emptied people into the cove. In the cove, a glistening black sweep of hide separated the water for an instant, then sank below. People thrashed, fought and went under.  Dan looked up. On the wooden building beyond the cove and the beach was a broad sign:         PORCYS PLANET     REJUVENATION CENTER  Dan read the sign three times. If this was rejuvenation, the Porcyns could have it.  Beside Dan, Milbun stood up, still struggling for breath, and pulled his wife and Mavis to their feet.  \"Come on,\" he said. \"We've _got_ to get through the swamp ahead of the grayboas!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The rest of the day, they pushed through slimy muck up to their knees and sometimes up to their necks. Behind them, the crowd screamingly thinned out.  That night, they washed in icy spring water, tore chunks of meat from a huge broiled creature turning on a spit and went to sleep in tents to the buzz and drone of creatures that shot their long needle noses through the walls like drillers hunting for oil.  The following day, they spent carefully easing from crevice to narrow toehold up the sheer face of a mountain. Food and shelter were at the top. Jagged rocks and hungry creatures were at the bottom. That night, Dan slept right through an urgent buzz from Kielgaard. The next night, he woke enough to hear it, but he didn't have the strength to answer.  Where, he thought, is the rejuvenation in this?  Then he had a sudden glimmering. It was the Porcyn _race_ that was rejuvenated. The unfit of the Porcyns died violently. It took stamina just to live from one day to the next.  Even the Milbuns were saying that this was the worst vacation ever. Trails slid out from under them. Trees fell toward them. Boulders bounded down steep slopes at them.  At first, the Milbuns tried to remember forgotten sins for which all this might be repayment. But when there was the dull _boom_ of an explosion and they narrowly escaped a landslide, Milbun looked at the rocks across the trail with sunken red eyes. He sniffed the air and growled, \"Undevised.\"  That afternoon, Dan and the Milbuns passed three average-looking men hanging by their hands from the limb of a tree beside the trail. The faces of the hanging men bore a surprised expression. They hung perfectly still and motionless, except for a slight swaying caused by the wind.  Dan and the Milbuns reached a mataform station late that afternoon.  A very hard-eyed guard in an orange cape, barred across the shoulders in black, let them through and they found themselves in another spaceship, bound for Fumidor, the mining planet.         *       *       *       *       *  Dan sat back exhausted and fell asleep. He was awakened by a determined buzz.  \"_Dan!_\" said Kielgaard's voice.  \"Yes.\" Dan sat up. \"Go ahead.\"  \"Trans-Space is going to try to take over Porcys. There's nothing you can do about that, but they've landed agents on Vacation Planet to pick you off. Look out.\"  Dan told Kielgaard what had happened to the agents on Vacation Planet, such as the \"undevised\" explosion and being hung up by the hands.  Kielgaard whistled. \"Maybe the Porcyns can take care of themselves. Trans-Space doesn't think so.\"  \"How did you find out?\"  The tiny voice held a note of grim satisfaction. \"They ran an agent in on us and he gave himself away. He went back with an organo-transmitter inside him, and a memory bank. The bank stores up the day's impressions. The transmitter squirts them out in one multi-frequency blast. The agent is poorly placed for an informant, but we've learned a lot through him.\"  \"How are they going to take over Porcys?\"  \"We don't know. They think they've found the Porcyns' weak point, but if so, we don't know what it is.\"  \"Listen,\" urged Dan, \"maybe _we_ ought to put a lot of agents on Porcys.\"  \"No,\" said Kielgaard. \"That's the wrong way to play it. If we go in now, we'll be too late to do any good. We're still counting on you.\"  \"There's not very much I can do by myself.\"  \"Just do your best. That's all we can ask.\"  Dan spent the next week chipping out pieces of a radioactive ore. At night, Kielgaard would report the jubilant mood of Trans-Space. On the following days, Dan would chop at the ore with vicious blows that jarred him from his wrists to his heels.  The steady monotonous work, once he was used to it, left his mind free to think and he tried furiously to plan what he would do when he got out. But he found he didn't really know enough about Porcys to make a sensible plan. Then he began trying to organize what he had seen and heard during his stay on the planet. At night, Kielgaard helped him and together they went over their theories, trying to find those that would fit the facts of Porcys.  \"It all hinges on population pressure,\" said Kielgaard finally. \"On most planets we know of, overpopulation leads to war, starvation, birth control or emigration. These are the only ways. At least, they were, till we discovered Porcys.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"All right,\" agreed Dan. \"Grant that. The Porcyns plainly don't have any of those things, or not to any great extent. Instead, they have institutions such as we've never seen before. They have 'sweepers,' so-called 'vacations' and a rope from building to building. All these things cut down population.\"  \"Don't forget their 'truth chairs,'\" said Kielgaard.  \"Where you either tell the truth or get converted to ashes--yes. But how does it all fit in?\"  \"Let's take one individual as an example. Start at birth.\"  \"He's born,\" said Dan. \"Probably they have nurseries, but we know they stick together as families, because we have the Milbuns to go by. He grows up, living at his parents' place. He goes with other children to school or to see different parts of his city. A lion--which he calls a 'dog'--protects him.\"  \"Yes,\" said Kielgaard. \"It protects him from sweepers. But most grownups don't need protection. Only those whose charge is low.\"  \"Of course. The boy hasn't been on vacation yet. He's not radioactive. Apparently you have to be radioactive to open doors. At the apartment house, the boy comes in a small door to one side. The lions, or what resemble lions, like the children but don't like the sweepers. And the sweepers are afraid of them. All right. But what about when he grows up?\"  \"Well, for one thing, he has to use the regular doors now. And they won't open unless he's been on vacation. And if he hasn't been on vacation and if his charge isn't high, the sweepers will go out and grab him. That must be what that sign you saw meant. 'Swept' was a warning that there was no escape in that direction.\"  \"I begin to see it,\" said Dan. \"I was safe on that road because the birth rate in that section wasn't high. But in the city, the birth rate _was_ high, so, to keep the population down, the standards were raised. Apparently the sweepers were fed less and got more hungry. People had to go on vacation more often. But what about the rope?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't think we really know enough to understand the rope,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51273"],["title","Advance Agent (#5)"],["body","ielgaard, \"but maybe it's a face-saving device. People who don't think they're in good enough shape to get through 'vacation,' and who don't want to die a slow death avoiding sweepers and waiting to go through locked doors, can go across on the rope. Or perhaps it's a penance. If a man has done something wrong and he's afraid to deny it in the truth chair, perhaps he's allowed to confess and go so many times across the rope as punishment. The people cheered. That must mean it's honorable.\"  \"That makes sense,\" Dan agreed. \"All right, but why don't they just ship their surplus population to the other two planets?\"  \"We've studied that back here,\" said Kielgaard. \"We think it's because they wouldn't dare. They've got their little mainland allotted and rationed down to the last blade of grass. They can do that because it's small enough to keep control of. Now suppose they try to enforce the same system on a new planet with a hundred times the land area--what's going to happen? They'll have unknown, uncontrollable factors to deal with. Their system will break down. That statue of theirs shows they know it, too. The man in the blue cape 'devises' and his strong right hand does nothing but keep the circle--their system--from flying apart. What puzzles me is that they're satisfied with it.\"  \"There's another point,\" Dan said, \"but I think I see it now. They've got a caste system, but people must be able to move from one caste to another. There must be a competitive exam or some system of choice. The vacation advisor said Mr. Milbun was 'at present' a merchant. His wife was 'now' a housewife. And no one ever asked my name, though I told it voluntarily to Milbun. It was always 'Yes, Devisement,' or 'Is it time to take your vacation, Devisement?' There were no personal titles like 'Sir Moglin,' or 'First Magistrate Moglin,' such as we've encountered on other planets.\"  Kielgaard grunted. \"That would explain the differently colored capes, too. No one would care if a man was a street-cleaner ten years ago. They'd see his cape was blue and give him immediate, automatic respect.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dan. \"That's it. And no one would dare _cheat_ about the color of the cape he wore, because, regardless of his position, sooner or later his charge would be gone. Then he would have to go on vacation. And to do _that_, he _has_ to sit in the truth chair and tell the truth or get incinerated.\" Dan stopped suddenly and sucked in a deep breath.  \"What's wrong?\" asked Kielgaard.  \"_That's_ the weak point.\"   VI  By the end of the week, Dan was able to pass through a door with a specialized type of Geiger counter in the locking circuit.  And by that time, Kielgaard had noted sharp fluctuations in the mood at Trans-Space. There had been an interval of wild confusion, but it hadn't lasted. Many more Trans-Space agents had gone to Porcys and Trans-Space seemed to be on top again.  The instant Dan stepped from the mines through the door marked \"Out,\" he was rushed through a shower, a shave and a haircut, shoved into a truth chair and asked questions, given a new cape and clothes, and buckled into a glittering belt by a purple-caped man addressed as \"Reverence.\" No sooner was the belt in place than all, including \"Reverence,\" snapped to attention.  \"Devisement,\" said a man in an orange-and-black cape, \"we need your decision quickly. At home, men have usurped cloaks of devisement and given orders contrary to the public good. They wore belts of power, but did not die when their false orders were given. In the Central City, they convened a council, seated themselves in the Hall of Truth, and on the very first oath every single one of them present was thrown into the life beyond.  \"Because the statue was already belted, men wearing cloaks of devisement _had_ to give the orders. But now they were all gone. Looters roamed the streets, breaking in doors. These men were vacation-dodgers--out so long that they couldn't even make a charge-light flicker--and the sweepers cleaned up some of them. _But they killed the sweepers!_ Devisement, I tell you the truth!\"  \"I believe you,\" said Dan.  \"Thank heaven. Devisement, something must be done. A young boy passed and graduated to the devisement cape, but before he could take action, he was shot from ambush. We found an old man of the right cape out in the country, and when we finally convinced him, he rounded up one hundred and fifty-seven vacation-dodgers and executed them. We had things in order, but now a glut of lunatics in devisement capes and belts of power have burst into the streets. Their orders are silly, yet their belts don't kill them. They have no fear of the Truth. Business is stopped and men are hungry. The people are going wild. Strange boats have appeared offshore. Mataform transmitters of odd design are being set up near the shore. This cannot go on without breaking the circle!\"  Dan's throat felt dry.  \"Sir,\" said the Porcyn desperately, \"you _must_ devise something! What shall we do?\"  A faint tingling at Dan's waist suggested to him that he choose his words carefully. One lie or bad intention and the belt of power would probably finish him.  He thought carefully. The total power of the Porcyn planet must be at least the equal of even the huge Trans-Space organization. And Porcys had its power all in one place. The planet was organized to the last ounce of energy, if only it could be brought to bear in time.  Dan ordered his anxious companions to take him to Porcys.         *       *       *       *       *  Far under the Central City, which was the city he had seen, he found a weary, powerful old man in a light-blue cape and glittering belt, directing operations from a television command post. The console showed street scenes of men in sky-blue capes and flashing belts, who danced and jabbered, their faces aglow with lunacy as they rapped out conflicting orders and the people jerked and dashed this way and that, tears running down their faces.  Near the statue, before the Hall of Truth, close ranks of Porcyn men in orange-and-black capes stood massed on the steps, holding sleek-bored guns. On the street below, gibbering lunatics in sky-blue danced and shrieked orders, but the eyes of the men on the steps were tightly shut. By a technicality, they avoided obedience to the lunacy, for with their eyes shut, how could they be sure who gave the command?  At the belted statue itself, a man in blue was clinging to one bronze arm as he slammed down a hammer to knock loose the partly broken circle. The statue obstinately refused to let go. At the base of the statue, holding a microphone, stood an average-looking man in a sky-blue cape, his lips drawn back in an amused smile. He gestured to men with crowbars and they tried to jam them between the statue and its base. This failing, they took up chisels and hammers. The man working on the circle shrugged and jumped down.  At the console, the old man looked up at Dan. He put his hand out and felt Dan's belt. Apparently the tingle reassured him and he seemed to accept Dan without further question.  \"This is about the end,\" he said. \"When that statue goes, those men will feel the jolt and open their eyes. They're the last formed body of troops on the planet, and when they go, we'll have nothing to strike with. There must be something I could devise for this, but I've been up three nights and I can't think.\"  \"Can you delay it?\" asked Dan, grappling with the beginning of his plan.  \"Oh, we'll delay it. I've got the last of the sweepers collected at the holes opening into the square. Just when that statue begins to tip, I'll let the sweepers out. That will stop things for a while. Then they'll kill the sweepers and my bolt is shot.\"  \"Won't the men you've got here fire on those blue-caped fakes?\"  \"Devisement,\" said the old man, shaking his head, \"you know better.\"  \"Are there any fire hoses? Will your men squirt water on the blue-caped ones?\"  \"Yes,\" said the old man, leaning forward. \"They'll get shot. But yes, they will. What is it? What are you devising?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dan outlined his plan. The old man's eyes lighted. He nodded and Dan went out and climbed with guides through a grim, dark tunnel where the sweepers were kept. He peered out the hole, and as across the street the statue began to tip, he burst outside and sprinted into the square.  The Trans-Space leader raised his microphone.  Dan ripped it out of his hand and knocked him off his feet, then knelt and picked up the heavy shield that had been taken off the statue to get at the ring.  A bullet hummed over Dan's head.  With a rush of air and a heavy smash, the statue landed full length on the ground. Dan hauled himself up onto its base. Another bullet buzzed past him. Then there was a yell, and Dan looked down in the street.  The sweepers were horrible as they poured from their holes, but they looked almost beautiful to Dan. He glanced at the Porcyns massed on the steps, their faces white with near-hysteria. Their eyes were open and watching him; the Trans-Space men were too busy to give orders.  Dan raised the microphone and his voice boomed out:  \"_Close your eyes till you hear the roar of the lion! Then obey your true leaders!_\"  He repeated the order three times before it dawned on the Trans-Space technicians that this was not according to plan. The loudspeaker gave a booming click and cut off. By then, the sweepers had been killed and Dan became aware of bullets thrumming past him. Suddenly he felt weak with panic that the rest of the plan had fallen apart.  Up the street, Porcyn men were unscrewing a cap on the face of a building. They connected a hose. A sky-blue-caped Trans-Space agent ordered them away. The Porcyns turned, wads of wax in their ears, and raised the hose.  A stream of water knocked the agents backward. Shots rang out. Porcyns fell, but other Porcyns took their places. The stream arched and fell on the Trans-Space agents and abruptly a"]]]
