Men in the shops' doorways echoed his shout.  \"A _kid_,\" said the man. \"They have to learn sometime, I know, but--\" He cut himself short. \"Well, all's well that ends well.\" He glanced respectfully at Dan. \"If you're here any length of time, sir, we'd certainly appreciate your looking into this. And if you're planning to stay long--well, as you see, our sweepers are hungry--our main store is on 122 Center Street. Our vacation advisor might be of some service to you.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Dan, his throat dry.  \"Not at all, Devisement.\" The man went inside, muttering, \"A _kid_.\"  Dan passed several more shops without seeing very much. He turned the corner. Across the street, where the boy had been, was a dented brass plate at the base of the building. On Dan's side of the street, trotting toward him, was a big, tawny-maned lion. Dan hesitated, then started up the street.  There was a faint clash of metal.  _Swish-swish._         *       *       *       *       *  A net seemed to form in the air and close around him. There was a feel of innumerable hairy spiders running over him from head to foot. The net vanished. Something wrapped around his ankle and yanked.  The lion growled.  There was a loud _clang_ and Dan's foot was free. He looked down and saw a brass plate labeled SWEEPER.  Dan decided it might be a good idea to see the Save-Your-Life Co.'s vacation advisor. He started out to locate 122 Center Street and gave all brass plates a wide berth on the way.  He strode through a briskly moving crowd of powerfully built men and women in capes of various colors, noticing uneasily that they were making way for him. He studied them as they passed, and saw capes of red, green, dark blue, brown, purple, and other shades and combinations of colors. But the only sky-blue cape he had seen so far was his own.  A sign on the corner of a building told Dan he was at Center Street. He crossed and the people continued to draw back for him.  It began to dawn on Dan that he had had the ultimate bad luck for a spy in an unknown country: He was marked out on sight as some sort of notable.  Just how bad his luck had been wasn't clear to him till he came to a small grassy square with an iron fence around it and a man-sized statue in the center. The granite base of the statue was inscribed:      I DEVISE  The statue itself was of bronze, showing a powerful man, his foot crushing down a mass of snapping monsters. In his right hand, he held together a large circle of metal, his fingers squeezing shut a cut in the metal, which would break the circle if he let go. His left hand made a partially open fist, into which a wrench had been fitted. The statue itself, protected by some clear finish from the weather, was plain brown in color.  But the statue's cape was enameled sky-blue.  Dan stared at the statue for a moment, then looked around. In the street beside it, a crowd of people was forming, their backs toward him and their heads raised. Dan looked up. Far up, near the tops of the buildings, he could make out a long cable stretched from one building to another across the street. Just on the other side of the crowd was the entrance to the main store of the Save-Your-Life Co.         *       *       *       *       *  Dan crossed the street and saw a very average-looking man, wearing an orange cape, come to a stop at the corner and look shrewdly around.  Dan blinked and looked again. _The man in orange was no Porcyn._  The man's glance fell on the statue and his lips twisted in an amused smile. He looked up toward the rope, then down at the crowd, and then studied the backs of the crowd and the fronts of the stores around him, the lids of his eyes half-closed in a calculating look.  A brass plate nearby popped open, a net of delicate hairy tendrils ran over him, and something like a length of tarred one-inch rope snaked out and wrapped around his legs. An outraged expression crossed his face. His hand came up. The rope yanked. He fell on the sidewalk. The rope hauled him into the hole. The brass plate snapped shut. From inside came a muffled report.  It occurred to Dan that Galactic was not the only organization interested in Porcys.  Dan looked thoughtfully at the brass plate for a moment, then walked toward the entrance of the Save-Your-Life Co., past display windows showing weights, cables, parallel bars, trapezes and giant springs with handles on each end.  He tried the door. It didn't move.  A clerk immediately opened the door and took Dan along a cool, chaste hallway to an office marked \"Vacation Advisor.\" Here a suave-looking man made an offhand remark about the birth rate, took a sudden look at Dan's cape, blinked, stiffened, glanced at Dan's midsection and relaxed. He went through his files and gave Dan a big photograph showing a smiling, healthy, middle-aged couple and a lovely girl about nineteen.  \"These are the Milbuns, sir. Mr. Milbun is a merchant at present. Quite well-to-do, I understand. Mrs. Milbun is a housewife right now. The daughter, Mavis, is with a midtown firm at the moment. The mother became ill at an awkward time. The family put their vacation off for her, and as a result their charge has run very low. If you can get to their apartment without being--ah--swept, I feel sure they will welcome you, sir.\" He scribbled a rough map on a piece of paper, drew an arrow and wrote \"6140 Runfast Boulevard, Apartment 6B,\" and stamped the paper \"Courtesy of Save-Your-Life Co.\"  Then he wished Dan a healthy vacation and walked with him to hold open the outer door.  Dan thanked him and went outside, where the crowd was now almost blocking the sidewalk. He forced his way free, saw someone point, and glanced at the statue.  The wrench in the statue's left hand had been replaced by what looked like a magnifying glass.  Dan had gone a few steps when there was a thundering cheer, then a terrified scream high in the air behind him. He turned around and saw a man come plummeting down. Dan gaped higher and saw a line of tiny figures going across high up on the rope. One of the figures slipped. There was another cheer.  Dan hurriedly turned away.  He had already convinced himself that the Porcyns had a \"proper mercantile attitude.\" And he thought he was beginning to get an idea as to how they kept their population down.   IV  Carefully avoiding brass plates, Dan made his way along an avenue of shops devoted to exercise and physical fitness. He came to Runfast Blvd. and located 6140, which looked like the apartment houses he had seen earlier.  He tried the outer door; it was locked. When someone came out, Dan caught the door and stepped in. As the door shut, he tried it and found it was locked again. He stood for a moment trying to understand it, but his sleeplessness of the night before was catching up with him. He gave up and went inside.  There were no elevators on the ground floor. Dan had his choice of six ropes, two ladders and a circular staircase. He went up the staircase to the third floor, where he saw a single elevator. He rode it up to the sixth, got off and found that there was a bank of four elevators on this floor.  He looked at the elevators a minute, felt himself getting dizzy, and walked off to locate apartment 6B.  A powerfully built gray-haired man of middle height answered his knock. Dan introduced himself and explained why he had come.  Mr. Milbun beamed and his right hand shot forward. Dan felt like a man with his hand caught in an airlock.  \"Lerna!\" called Milbun. \"Lerna! Mavis! We have a guest for vacation!\"  Dan became aware of a rhythmical clinking somewhere in the back of the apartment. Then a big, strong-looking woman, obviously fresh from the kitchen, hurried in, smiling. If she had been ill, she was clearly recovered now.  \"Ah, how are you?\" she cried. \"We're so happy to have you!\" She gripped his hand and called, \"_Mavis!_\"  The clinking stopped. A beautifully proportioned girl came in, wearing a sweatshirt and shorts. \"Mother, I simply have to get off another pound or so--Oh!\" She stared at Dan.  \"Mavis,\" said Mr. Milbun, \"this is Mr. Dan Redman. Devisement, my daughter Mavis.\"  \"You're going with us!\" she said happily. \"How wonderful!\"  \"Now,\" said Mr. Milbun, \"I imagine his Devisement wants to get a little rest before he goes down to the gym.\" He glanced at Dan. \"We have a splendid gym here.\"  \"Oh,\" said Mavis eagerly, \"and you can use my weights.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Dan.  \"We're leaving tomorrow,\" Milbun told him. \"The birth rate's still rising here, and last night the charge correction went up again. A little more and it'll take two of us to get a door open. It won't inconvenience you to leave tomorrow?\"  \"Not at all,\" said Dan.  \"Splendid.\" Milbun turned to his wife. \"Lerna, perhaps our guest would like a little something to eat.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The food was plain, good and plentiful. Afterward, Mavis showed Dan to his room. He sank down gratefully on a firm, comfortable bed. He closed his eyes....  Someone was shaking him gently.  \"Don't you want to go down to the gym?\" asked Mr. Milbun. \"Remember, we're leaving tomorrow.\"  \"Of course,\" said Dan.  Feeling that his brain was functioning in a vacuum, Dan followed the Milbuns into the hall, climbed down six stories on a ladder, then into the basement on a rope. He found himself in a room with a stony dirt track around the wall, ropes festooning the ceiling, an irregularly shaped pool, and artificial shrubs and foliage from behind which sprang mechanical monsters. The Milbuns promptly vanished behind imitation vine-covered doors and came out again in gym clothes.  Dan went through the doorway Mr. Milbun had come out of and discovered that the Save-Your-Life Co. had a machine inside which dispensed washed, pressed and sterilized gym clothes for a small fee. The machine worked by turning a selector dial to the proper size, pressing a lever, and then depositing the correct fee in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51273"],["title","Advance Agent (#3)"],["body","open box on the wall nearby. Dan studied this a moment in puzzlement, guessed his proper size and put the correct payment in the box.  He put on the gym clothes and went outside.  For forty-five minutes, mechanical creatures of odd and various shapes sprang at him from behind shrubbery, gripped him when he passed holes in the floor and wound themselves around his legs as he tried to swim in the pool.  His temper worsened. He stopped to look at Mavis as she swayed, laughing, on a rope above two things like mobile giant clamshells.  Mr. Milbun shook his head. \"Mavis, remember, we're leaving _tomorrow_.\"  Just then, something snarled and lunged at Dan from the side. There was a flash of teeth.  Dan whirled. His fist shot out. There was a scream of machinery, then a crash and a clatter. An imitation monster with a huge jaw and giant teeth lay on its back on the floor.  Milbun let out a slow whistle. \"_Dismounted_ it. Boy!\"  \"A one-bite, too,\" breathed Mavis.  Mrs. Milbun came over and looked at Dan approvingly.  Dan had been about to apologize, but checked himself when the others smiled cheerfully and went back to what they were doing. This consisted of dodging, tricking or outrunning the various contraptions that lunged at them, chased them, tripped them, trailed, stalked and sprang out at them from nearly every place in the room.  Finally the gym began to fill up with other people. The Milbuns got ready to leave and Dan followed.         *       *       *       *       *  Dan lay in his bed that night and tried to summarize the points he didn't understand. First was the question of vacation. But he supposed he would learn about that tomorrow. Next was \"charge.\" Apparently one went on vacation when his \"charge\" was low, because the vacation advisor had said, \"The family put their vacation off for her, and as a result their charge has run very low.\" But just what was \"charge\"?  Dan remembered the flickering bulb in the store window, ringed by the words \"Your Corrected Charge--Courtesy of Save-Your-Life Co.\" Apparently he had _some_ charge, because the bulb had flickered. But where did he get it?  Then he thought of the waterfront and of the little boy caught at the hole. What was the point of that? And why did that produce such an uproar when, a little later, a grown man could get dragged out of sight on a well-traveled street and never cause a single notice?  Dan felt himself sinking into a maze of confusion. He dismissed the problems and went to sleep clinging to one fact. The Porcyns _must_ be honest people who would keep an agreement, once made. On what other planet could anyone find a slot machine with no slot, but just an open box for the money?  Dan fell asleep, content that he had the answer to that part of the problem, at least.  Before it was light, he awoke to an odd familiar buzz inside his head.  \"Dan,\" said Kielgaard's voice, small and remote.  Dan rolled over, lay on his back and spoke sub-vocally. \"Right here.\"  \"Can you talk?\"  \"Yes,\" said Dan, \"if I can stay awake.\"  \"Can you give us a summary?\"  \"Sure.\" Dan told him briefly what had happened.  Kielgaard was silent a moment. Then he said, \"What do you think 'charge' is?\"  \"I haven't been in any condition to think. Maybe it's a surgically implanted battery, set to run down after so long.\"  \"Too clumsy. What about radioactivity?\"  \"H'm. Yes, you mentioned a mine on the inner planet. Maybe they mine radioactive ore. That would explain why I have _some_ charge. There's residual radioactivity even in the atmosphere of Earth.\"  \"That's so,\" said Kielgaard. \"But not every planet has it. I'm wondering about this other agent you mentioned seeing. He sounds to me like someone from Trans-Space. And that's bad.\"  \"They play dirty,\" Dan conceded.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Worse than that,\" said Kielgaard's tiny voice. \"They recruit their agents from Lassen Two. Maybe that's a break. Unlike Earth, Lassen Two is nearly radiation-free. And Trans-Space doesn't use finesse. They'll pump Porcys full of agents loaded down with organo-transmitters. Visual, auditory and olfactory. They'll broadcast on every wave-length, suck out as much information in as short a time as they can, then either pull some dirty trick or slam the Porcyns an offer. That is, if everything goes according to plan.  \"But meanwhile,\" he added, \"one or more of their agents is bound to stand in front of a free 'Your charge' device somewhere in the city. Very likely, that agent will be radiation-free and some Porcyn, for the first time in his life, is going to see a bulb that doesn't even flicker. If the Porcyns are as scientifically advanced as we think, and if Trans-Space is as dirty as usual, there may be a rat-race on before we know it.\"  Dan lay gloomily still.  \"Dan,\" said Kielgaard, \"where were you standing in relation to the other agent? Did he come up from behind or was he in front of you when you reached the statue?\"  \"I was in front of him. Why?\"  \"Because then you were in his range of vision. _He_ may not have noticed you, but his organo-transmitter would. The chances are you appeared on the screen back at Trans-Space headquarters. They record those scenes as they come in and their experts go over them frame by frame. Unless you happened to be behind someone, they'll see your image on the screen, spot you here and there in other scenes from other agents, study your actions and recognize you as an agent just as surely as you recognized their agent.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dan wearily, \"of course they will.\" He was thinking that if he had been more awake yesterday, he would have thought of this himself and perhaps avoided it. But he couldn't be alert without sleep and who could sleep in a heaving boat in a thunderstorm?  \"This changes things,\" Kielgaard was saying. \"I'm going to see if we can get a little faster action.\"  \"I think I'd better get some more sleep,\" Dan answered. \"I may need it tomorrow.\"  \"I agree,\" said Kielgaard. \"You'll have to keep your eyes open. Good night, Dan, and good luck.\"  \"Thanks.\"  Dan rolled over on his side. He tried for a moment to remember how the other agent had been standing and whether anyone had been between them to block his view, but he couldn't be sure. Dan decided there was nothing to do but assume the worst. He blanked his mind. Soon a feeling of deep weariness came over him and he fell asleep.         *       *       *       *       *  In the morning, Dan and the Milbuns ate a hurried breakfast. Dan helped Mr. Milbun grease his rowing machine, weights, springs and chinning bar, so they wouldn't rust in his absence. Milbun worked in a somber mood. All the Milbuns, in fact, were unusually quiet for a family going on vacation. When they went out into the hall, carrying no baggage, they even took the elevator to the third floor.  \"Better save our strength,\" said Mr. Milbun.  The street seemed to Dan to have a different atmosphere. People were walking quietly in groups, their eyes cool and alert. The Milbuns walked in front of the apartment houses Dan had passed the day before, and across the street he saw the place where the chiseled motto had read:       Freedom     Devisement     Fraternity  It was gone. Some workmen nearby were lifting a stone slab onto a cart. Dan blinked. The motto now read:      Alertness     Devisement     Vigilance  The Milbuns plainly noticed it, too. They drew closer together and looked around thoughtfully. Carefully keeping away from brass plates labeled SWEEPER, they followed a devious route that led to the statue.  The statue had changed, too. The hand that gripped the circle was now hidden by a massive shield. The other hand still held what looked like a magnifying glass, and the motto was still \"I Devise.\" But the shield gave the whole statue a look of strange menace.  Across the street, near the place where Dan had seen the Trans-Space agent, stood several men wearing orange capes, barred black across the shoulders. Nearby, the brass plate opened and a man in work clothes handed out a box and went back in.  At a store entrance up the street, watching them, stood an average-looking man in a purple cape, his look intent and calculating.  Mavis glanced at the statue and took Dan's arm. \"Devisement,\" she said, \"they won't take you now, will they, before vacation?\"  Dan kept an uneasy silence and Mr. Milbun said, \"Of course not, Mavis. Where's the belt?\"  Mavis glanced at the statue. \"Oh.\"  Dan looked at the statue, then at Mavis and Mr. Milbun, said nothing and went on.  They came to a large building with a long flight of broad wide steps. Across the face of the building was boldly and sternly lettered, high up:      HALL OF TRUTH  Lower down was the motto:          \"Speak the Truth--     Live Yet a While With Us.\"   V  On one side of the stairs as they climbed was a statue of a man, smiling. On the other side was an urn with a bunch of carved flowers lying beside it.  A big bronze door stood open at the top. They walked through into a large chamber with massive seats in triple rows along two walls, and a single row of yet more massive seats raised along the farther wall.  A bored-looking man got up from a low desk as the Milbuns sat down in three of the massive seats.  The man asked in a dreary voice, \"Have you, to the best of your knowledge, committed any wrong or illegal act or acts since your last vacation?\" He picked up a whiskbroom and pan and waited for their answers.  \"No,\" said the three Milbuns in earnest quavering voices.  The man looked at each of them, shrugged and said boredly, \"Pass through to your vacations, live law-abiding citizens.\" He beckoned impatiently to Dan, turned to scowl at him, saw Dan's cape, stiffened, looked hastily out to the statue framed by the doorway, relaxed slightly and inquired respectfully, \"Is it time for you to go on vacation, Devisement?\"  \"It seems to be,\" said Dan.  \"I think you should, sir. Then you'd be still more helpful if called.\"  Dan nodded noncommittally"]]]
