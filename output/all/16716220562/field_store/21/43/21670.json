He deigned to comply.  I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors, Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland.         *       *       *       *       *  Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"  I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I couldn't see.  \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm shocked. _I_ am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps to establish your moral capabilities.\"  \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"  \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"  I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought of something else.  \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you deserve _life_.\"  Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather extreme, Warden.\"  \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"  \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But life--no, I think not.\"  I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did. I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and Horbit did.  There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that morning, nothing in it for him.  Unless--  Unless what he said was literally true.  I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\" I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"  Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"  I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully.         *       *       *       *       *  Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek marked time with every new page.  \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.  Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \"_You_ call me that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting back my right senses?\"  \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your mind--I am a _real_ man. This wild, distorted place is a _real_ place.\"  \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes have seen the glory.\"  \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"  He nodded slowly. \"I _have_ often suspected this was hell.\"  \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly scientific. This world is in another dimension--one that is not length, breadth or thickness--but a real one nevertheless.\"  \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"  \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come from--and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a well-meaning despot.\"  Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"  He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He--our leader--doubts your abilities as President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in that belief.\"  He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"  \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of your worth.\"  \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.  \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader, who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence, moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"  \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.  \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"  He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"  \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.  I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.  \"Paulson--or should I call you Pinkerton?--this will come as a shock, a shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was _real_.\"  Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their luster. \"Then _this_ is the Dream. I've thought--\"  \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"  I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.  \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"  \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.  I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who ever lived. Pinkerton!\"  \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"  \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you, his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"  \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.  \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"  \"No!\"  \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you. But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"  \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look like the President?\"  \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"  \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew he was not merely insane now.  It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would believe--but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers. They _wanted_ to believe them. The stories gave them what they were after--without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for crimes they hadn't committed.  They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.  Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how justified they might think it was.  \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as smug as you please.\"  \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I remarked.  \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges. Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys didn't like that. Look at me--I'm defenseless!\"  I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"  Now was the time.  I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.  Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51350"],["title","No Substitutions (#3)"],["body","I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the opiate of my Dream?  Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have any meaning for me.  Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him. He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever. He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.  I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed it back to my original choice.  \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting you a five-year probation.\"  The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"  My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.  \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if _this_ world was the _real_ one.\"  Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"  \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"  \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"  \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you _life_ in Dreamland.\"  Coleman sat back down suddenly.  \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want a relatively _short_ sentence of a few months or a few years. I can think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams--you don't want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place, you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the newscasts sometimes make it seem.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.  \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me, Coleman.\"  \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"  \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it _were_ all a Dream.\"  Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.  The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.  Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for the Free Will of the Universe.\"  \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.  I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor presented always helped me to relax."]]]
