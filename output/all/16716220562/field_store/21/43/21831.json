The procession pulled over to the bank next to the mesh fence which screened debris from the water flowing into the plant. On the bank lay his mobility unit, which apparently had been detached before they trucked him into the city originally. The king got out of his palanquin and examined it curiously. Then he got back in and they drove along the bank to the other side of the hydroelectric plant. The river continued its swift passage, apparently unslowed by the drain on it.  Regan thought the river looked tremendously inviting. In its depths, he could be free of the well-meaning crowd of sightseeing guides. The river represented peace, an end to being shown around, measured, observed, exhibited and tantalized. In it, he could die calmly, without any frustrating diplomacy.  A bridge spanned the river below the plant. By the gestures of the scientists, he gathered that they were going to cross over to see interesting things which lay across the river. The bridge was a narrow wooden one. Parallel to it was the stone framework of an unfinished replacement. They proceeded slowly over the rickety, railless bridge.  The approach to it was banked, so that Regan was tilted in his seat, toward the outside. The bus leveled off as it reached the wooden planking and Regan tilted the other way. A loose plank under a wheel sent him swaying back again. With all his remaining strength, he leaned with the tilt. It was just enough to send him off balance.  They reached out to pull him back, but it was too late. He was out of the bus and dropping the short distance to the water.  The current was so swift that he went only a little way under, then bobbed up and was rushed along, turning over and over. As he revolved, he caught glimpses of consternation on the bridge. He saw the bus back off and race along the road on the bank, hands waving out of it. But it couldn't catch up with him. He was moving too fast.  The even motion of the river was soothing. Regan took a swallow from his tube and relaxed. There was a dull ache in his stomach, but no more stabbing spasms. Maybe he was dying. He didn't care.         *       *       *       *       *  Regan knew he was in a hospital even before he opened his eyes. The ether-and-disinfectant smell told him that.  It was taking an effort to thrust his eyelids up. He moved his arms and felt them close to his body. He raised one hand to his face and rubbed his closed eyes. Of course they'd have got him out of the spacesuit.  He opened his eyes.  A brown-faced man was leaning over the bed. He was wearing a white smock and had a fountain pen in the breast pocket. Beyond the man--the doctor--there was a window. A perfectly ordinary window, through which Regan could see the sky. A blue sky with white clouds in it.  The doctor smiled at Regan and said in English: \"How do you feel, son?\"  Regan tried to speak but couldn't.  \"This is Bombay,\" the doctor said. \"Bombay, in India. It must be quite a surprise to you, but I'm glad to say you'll be all right.\"  \"What?\" Regan asked vaguely.  \"It's strange, of course,\" said the doctor. \"You should be on the other side of the world, by all that's natural. We communicated with the American authorities when we saw your identification. It is extremely odd. Still, here you are, and you will be well. Quite soon, too.\"  \"But--\" Regan began. Then he gave up. He said nothing more until after he'd eaten and slept and the doctor asked him if he felt strong enough now to see the reporters.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Two more, sir?\" the bartender at the Palmer House asked.  I nodded.  \"Naturally they thought I was delirious,\" Regan said, \"or had been. They had to accept the fact that I'd been through the Earth. Not through the center of it, or anywhere near it--they tell me that's practically solid nickel, or molten, or whatever. But there was no disputing that I'd gone down in the Atlantic and come up in the Indian Ocean. They'd seen me go down and they'd seen me come up and obviously I'd been somewhere in the interval. I hadn't walked, that was for sure.  \"They credited my story of the underground river. The Greeks had a word for it, they tell me. The Greeks thought the Alpheus River wandered down under the Adriatic and came up in Sicily. I don't know much about their river, but mine apparently follows the Earth's curve maybe a dozen miles below the surface.  \"But nobody wanted any part of my story of the city and the king and the beehive houses and the rectangular bus. Delirium, they said. Oh, they were kind about it, but they said it. So did the geophysical boys upstairs, in their eight-syllabled way.\"  The bartender brought fresh highballs, but Regan still held the glass the old drink had been in. He put it on its side on the bar and stared at the open end. I got the image--a tunnel filled with rushing water, a tunnel under the world.  Regan almost echoed my thoughts.  \"Tunnel under the Antarctic,\" he said half to himself. \"That's where it must have been, that city. Down there, deep under the ice. Used to be tropics, you know.\"  \"The Antarctic?\" I said.  \"Before the ice came, before the Earth's axis shifted. Those people--they didn't evacuate, I guess. They went underground. Funny they should have built themselves houses the same shape as those of the Eskimos who stayed above-ground in the North--like igloos. But probably that's just coincidence. You don't find igloos in the tropics. I'd guess their beehive houses are naturally influenced by the cavern they live in--their little universe.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Regan looked up. He grinned and set the empty glass upright on the bar. \"I've had a lot of time to think about it. They're awfully nice people, all of them. I could have had a wonderful time if I'd been able to climb out of that damn spacesuit. In time, I could even have communicated with them passably well. Good-looking women, too.\"  He looked at me speculatively. He opened his mouth as if to speak again, then smiled and shook his head.  I said it for him: \"You're going back.\"  \"Yes,\" he answered. \"Yes, I'm going back. I know the coordinates of the entrance to the passageway and its dimensions and the kind of equipment I'll need. Nothing elaborate. In another year or so, I'll have enough saved up, I think. Get myself a little space launch; one of the smaller ones, lifeboat size. Fit it out with food and water--and some picture books, of course, to show them what it's like where I come from. I'd take somebody along with me if I could find anyone who wanted to go--and who believed me.\"  \"I believe you,\" I said. \"But--\"  \"Sure. You'd be crazy to go. Wife and kids. I've got none of that. Mostly what I want to do, I guess, is prove those longbeards upstairs are cockeyed.\"  \"I hope you do. Maybe you'll let me write about it when you get back.\"  \"It'll be a good story,\" Regan assured me.  \"I'll be waiting for it,\" I promised.  That was five years ago. Four years ago, Regan went, as he said he would. He went alone, in a little space launch.  I'm still waiting to write the end of the story."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51768"],["title","Prospector's Special (#0)"],["body","PROSPECTOR'S SPECIAL                            By ROBERT SHECKLEY                           Illustrated by DILLON             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                  Galaxy Science Fiction December 1959.

The sandcar moved smoothly over the rolling dunes, its six fat wheels rising and falling like the ponderous rumps of tandem elephants. The hidden sun beat down from a dead-white sky, pouring heat into the canvas top, reflecting heat back from the parched sand.  \"Stay awake,\" Morrison told himself, pulling the sandcar back to its compass course.  It was his twenty-first day on Venus's Scorpion Desert, his twenty-first day of fighting sleep while the sandcar rocked across the dunes, forging over humpbacked little waves. Night travel would have been easier, but there were too many steep ravines to avoid, too many house-sized boulders to dodge. Now he knew why men went into the desert in teams; one man drove while the other kept shaking him awake.  \"But it's better alone,\" Morrison reminded himself. \"Half the supplies and no accidental murders.\"  His head was beginning to droop; he snapped himself erect. In front of him, the landscape shimmered and danced through the polaroid windshield. The sandcar lurched and rocked with treacherous gentleness. Morrison rubbed his eyes and turned on the radio.  He was a big, sunburned, rangy young man with close-cropped black hair and gray eyes. He had come to Venus with a grubstake of twenty thousand dollars, to find his fortune in the Scorpion Desert as others had done before him. He had outfitted in Presto, the last town on the edge of the wilderness, and spent all but ten dollars on the sandcar and equipment.  In Presto, ten dollars just covered the cost of a drink in the town's only saloon. So Morrison ordered rye and water, drank with the miners and prospectors, and laughed at the oldtimers' yarns about the sandwolf packs and the squadrons of voracious birds that inhabited the interior desert. He knew all about sunblindness, heat-stroke and telephone breakdown. He was sure none of it would happen to him.  But now, after twenty-one days and eighteen hundred miles, he had learned respect for this waterless waste of sand and stone three times the area of the Sahara. You really _could_ die here!  But you could also get rich, and that was what Morrison planned to do.         *       *       *       *       *  His radio hummed. At full volume, he could hear the faintest murmur of dance music from Venusborg. Then it faded and only the hum was left.  He turned off the radio and gripped the steering wheel tightly in both hands. He unclenched one hand and looked at his watch. Nine-fifteen in the morning. At ten-thirty he would stop and take a nap. A man had to have rest in this heat. But only a half-hour nap. Treasure lay somewhere ahead of him, and he wanted to find it before his supplies got much lower.  The precious outcroppings of goldenstone _had_ to be up ahead! He'd been following traces for two days now. Maybe he would hit a real bonanza, as Kirk did in '89, or Edmonson and Arsler in '93. If so, he would do just what they did. He'd order up a Prospector's Special, and to hell with the cost.  The sandcar rolled along at an even thirty miles an hour, and Morrison tried to concentrate on the heat-blasted yellow-brown landscape. That sandstone patch over there was just the tawny color of Janie's hair.  After he struck it rich, he and Janie would get married, and he'd go back to Earth and buy an ocean farm. No more prospecting. Just one rich strike so he could buy his spread on the deep blue Atlantic. Maybe some people thought fish-herding was tame; it was good enough for him.  He could see it now, the mackerel herds drifting along and browsing at the plankton pens, himself and his trusty dolphin keeping an eye out for the silvery flash of a predatory barracuda or a steel-gray shark coming along behind the branching coral....  Morrison felt the sandcar lurch. He woke up, grabbed the steering wheel and turned it hard. During his moments of sleep, the vehicle had crept over the dune's crumbling edge. Sand and pebbles spun under the fat tires as the sandcar fought for traction. The car tilted perilously. The tires shrieked against the sand, gripped, and started to pull the vehicle back up the slope.  Then the whole face of the dune collapsed.  Morrison held onto the steering wheel as the sandcar flipped over on its side and rolled down the slope. Sand filled his mouth and eyes. He spat and held on while the car rolled over again and dropped into emptiness.  For seconds, he was in the air. The sandcar hit bottom squarely on its wheels. Morrison heard a double boom as the two rear tires blew out. Then his head hit the windshield.         *       *       *       *       *  When he recovered consciousness, the first thing he did was look at his watch. It read 10:35.  \"Time for that nap,\" Morrison said to himself. \"But I guess I'll survey the situation first.\"  He found that he was at the bottom of a shallow fault strewn with knife-edged pebbles. Two tires had blown on impact, his windshield was gone, and one of the doors was sprung. His equipment was strewn around, but appeared to be intact.  \"Could have been worse,\" Morrison said.  He bent down to examine the tires more carefully.  \"It _is_ worse,\" he said.  The two blown tires were shredded beyond repair. There wasn't enough rubber left in them to make a child's balloon. He had used up his spares ten days back crossing Devil's Grill. Used them and discarded them. He couldn't go on without tires.  Morrison unpacked his telephone. He wiped dust from its black plastic face, then dialed Al's Garage in Presto. After a moment, the small video screen lighted up. He could see a man's long, mournful, grease-stained face.  \"Al's Garage. Eddie speaking.\"  \"Hi, Eddie. This is Tom Morrison. I bought that GM sandcar from you about a month ago. Remember?\"  \"Sure I remember you,\" Eddie said. \"You're the guy doing a single into the Southwest Track. How's the bus holding out?\"  \"Fine. Great little car. Reason I called--\"  \"Hey,\" Eddie said, \"what happened to your face?\"  Morrison put his hand to his forehead and felt blood. \"Nothing much,\" he said. \"I went over a dune and blew out two tires.\"  He turned the telephone so that Eddie could see the tires.  \"Unrepairable,\" said Eddie.  \"I thought so. And I used up all my spares crossing Devil's Grill. Look, Eddie, I'd like you to 'port me a couple of tires. Retreads are fine. I can't move the sandcar without them.\"  \"Sure,\" Eddie said, \"except I haven't any retreads. I'll have to 'port you new ones at five hundred apiece. Plus four hundred dollars 'porting charges. Fourteen hundred dollars, Mr. Morrison.\"  \"All right.\"  \"Yes, sir. Now if you'll show me the cash, or a money order which you can send back with the receipt, I'll get moving on it.\"  \"At the moment,\" Morrison said, \"I haven't got a cent on me.\"  \"Bank account?\"  \"Stripped clean.\"  \"Bonds? Property? Anything you can convert into cash?\"  \"Nothing except this sandcar, which you sold me for eight thousand dollars. When I come back, I'll settle my bill with the sandcar.\"  \"_If_ you get back. Sorry, Mr. Morrison. No can do.\"  \"What do you mean?\" Morrison asked. \"You know I'll pay for the tires.\"  \"And you know the rules on Venus,\" Eddie said, his mournful face set in obstinate lines. \"No credit! Cash and carry!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I can't run the sandcar without tires,\" Morrison said. \"Are you going to strand me out here?\"  \"Who in hell is stranding you?\" Eddie asked. \"This sort of thing happens to prospectors every day. You know what you have to do now, Mr. Morrison. Call Public Utility and declare yourself a bankrupt. Sign over what's left of the sandcar, equipment, and anything you've found on the way. They'll get you out.\"  \"I'm not turning back,\" Morrison said. \"Look!\" He held the telephone close to the ground. \"You see the traces, Eddie? See those red and purple flecks? There's precious stuff near here!\"  \"Every prospector sees traces,\" Eddie said. \"Damned desert is full of traces.\"  \"These are rich,\" Morrison said. \"These are leading straight to big stuff, a bonanza lode. Eddie, I know it's a lot to ask, but if you could stake me to a couple of tires--\"  \"I can't do it,\" Eddie said. \"I just work here. I can't 'port you any tires, not unless you show me money first. Otherwise I get fired and probably jailed. You know the law.\"  \"Cash and carry,\" Morrison said bleakly.  \"Right. Be smart and turn back now. Maybe you can try again some other time.\"  \"I spent twelve years getting this stake together,\" Morrison said. \"I'm not going back.\"  He turned off the telephone and tried to think. Was there anyone else on Venus he could call? Only Max Krandall, his jewel broker. But Max couldn't raise fourteen hundred dollars in that crummy two-by-four office near Venusborg's jewel market. Max could barely scrape up his own rent, much less take care of stranded prospectors.  \"I can't ask Max for help,\" Morrison decided. \"Not until I've found goldenstone. The real stuff, not just traces. So that leaves it up to me.\"  He opened the back of the sandcar and began to unload, piling his equipment on the sand. He would have to choose carefully; anything he took would have to be carried on his back.  The telephone had to go with him, and his lightweight testing kit. Food concentrates, revolver, compass. And nothing else but water, all the water he could carry. The rest of the stuff would have to stay behind.  By nightfall, Morrison was ready. He looked regretfully at the twenty cans of water he was leaving. In the desert, "]]]
