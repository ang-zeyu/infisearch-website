It would ease things if Holly were married to one of us, but even so it wouldn't be entirely clear. It has to do with the invasion of privacy.\"  \"Privacy? In this case the very idea is ridiculous.\"  \"Maybe so,\" said Paul Wallach. \"But I don't make the rules. They're _natural_ laws. As immutable as the laws of gravity or the refraction of light. And Tom, even if I were making the laws I might not change things. Not even to save Holly Carter's life. Because, Tom, if telepathy and perception were as free and unbounded as some of their early proponents claimed, life would be a sheer, naked hell on earth.\"  \"But what has privacy to do with it? This Harla isn't at all humanoid. A cat can look at a king--\"  \"Sure, Tom. But how long would the cat be permitted to read the king's mind?\"  I grunted. \"Has this Harla any mental block about examining the outside?\"  He looked at me thoughtfully. \"You're thinking about a scar or some sort of blemish?\"  \"Yes. Birthmark, maybe. No one is perfect.\"  \"You know of any?\"  I thought.  It was not hard for me to conjure up a picture of Holly Carter. Unfortunately, I looked at Holly Carter through the eyes of love, which rendered her perfect. If she had bridgework, I hadn't found it out. Her features were regular and her hair fell loose without a part. Her complexion was flawless ... at least the complexion that could be examined whilst Holly sunned herself on a deck chair beside the swimming pool.  I shook my head. Then I faced an unhappy fact. It hurt, because I wanted my goddess to be perfect, and if she were made of weak, mortal flesh, I did not want to find it out by asking the man who knew her better than I did.  Still, I wanted her alive. So I turned to Frank Crandall.  \"Do you?\" I asked.  \"Do I what?\"  \"Know of any scars or birthmarks?\"  \"Such as?\"  \"Oh, hell,\" I snapped. \"Such as an appendix scar that might be used to tell left from right.\"  \"Look, Tom, I'm not her physician, you know. I can only give you the old answer: 'Not until they wear briefer swim suits.'\"  My heart bounced lightly. That Holly was still in mortal danger was not enough to stop my elation at hearing Frank Crandall admit that he was not Holly's lover, nor even on much better terms than I. It might have been better to face the knowledge that Holly was all woman and all human even though the information had to come from someone who knew her well enough to get her home.  Then I came back to earth. I had my perfect goddess--in deadly peril--instead of a human woman who really did not belong to any man.         *       *       *       *       *  I hadn't seen Saul Graben leave, but he must have been gone because now he opened the door and came back. He was carrying a heavy rim gyroscope that was spinning in a set of frictionless gymbals. He looked most confused.  He said, \"I've spent what seems like an hour. You can't tell me that this gizmo is inseparable from the selfish, insular intellect of terrestrial so-called homo sapiens.\"  He turned the base and we all watched the gymbal rings rotate to keep the gyro wheel in the same plane. \"It should be cosmic,\" he said. \"But every time I start, I find myself biting myself on the back of the neck. Look. If you make the axle horizontal in front of you and rotate the gyro with the top edge going away from you, you can define a common reference. But motion beyond that cannot be explained. If the axle is depressed on the right side, the gyro will turn so the far edge looks to the right. But that's defining A in terms of A. So I'm licked.\"  Frank Crandall shook his head. \"There's probably an absolute to that thing somewhere, but I'm sure none of us know it. We haven't time to find it. In fact, I think the cause is lost. Maybe we'd better spend our time figuring out a plausible explanation.\"  \"Explanation?\" blurted Wallach.  \"Let's face it,\" said Crandall. \"Holly Carter's life is slipping away. No one has yet come close to finding a common reference to describe right from left to this Harla creature.\"  \"So what's your point?\"  \"Death is for the dying,\" Crandall said in a monotone. \"Let them have their hour in peace and dignity. Life is for the living, and for the living there is no peace. We who remain must make the best of it. So now in about five minutes Holly will be at peace. The rest of us have got to answer for her.\"  \"How do you mean?\"  \"How do you propose to explain this unfortunate incident?\" asked Crandall. \"Someone will want to know what happened to the remains of Holly Carter. I can see hell breaking loose. And I can see the whole lot of us getting laughed right off the Earth because we couldn't tell right from left. And I can see us all clobbered for letting the affair take place.\"  \"You seem to be more worried about your professional reputation than about Holly Carter's life!\"  \"I have a future,\" he said. \"Holly doesn't seem to. Hell,\" he groaned, \"we can't even gamble on it.\"  \"Gamble?\"  \"How successful do you think you'd be in getting this Venusian to risk his life by closing his eyes and making a fifty-fifty stab in the dark at one of those buttons?\"  \"Well--\" started Wallach--\"we'd be gambling too, you know. But--\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Wait a moment,\" I said. \"I've got a sort of half-cracked theory. May I try?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"Not 'of course.' I'll have to have quiet, with just Teresa to communicate through.\"  \"If you have any ideas, try them,\" said Wallach.  \"Do you really know what you're doing?\" demanded Frank Crandall.  \"I think so,\" I replied. \"If it works, it'll be because I happen to feel close to Holly.\"  \"Could be,\" he said with a shrug. I almost flipped. Duels have been fought over less. But instead of taking offense, Crandall topped it off by adding, \"You could have been a lot closer if you'd tried. She always said you had the alert, pixie-type mind that was pure relaxation instead of a dead let-down after a period of deep concentration. But you were always scuttling off somewhere. Well, go ahead and try, Tom. And good luck!\"  I took a deep breath.  \"Teresa?\" I asked.  \"Yes, Mr. Lincoln?\"  \"Tell Harla to concentrate on the buttons.\"  \"He is.\"  \"There is a subtle difference between them.\"  \"This he knows, but he does not know what it is.\"  \"There is a delicate difference in warmth. One button will be faintly warmer than the other.\"  \"Harla has felt them.\"  I dropped the third-person address and spoke to Teresa as if she were but one end of a telephone line. \"Harla,\" I said, \"only part of the difference lies in the warmth to physical touch. There should be another kind of warmth. Are you not affected by a _feeling_ that one is better than the other?\"  Harla's reply came direct through Teresa: \"Why yes, I am indeed drawn to the warmer of the two. Were this a game I would wager on it. But that is emotion and hardly suitable as a guide.\"  \"Ah, but it is!\" I replied quickly. \"This is our frame of reference. Press the warmer of the but--\"  I was violently interrupted. Wallach shook me violently and hurled me away from Teresa. Frank Crandall was facing the girl, shouting, \"No! No! The warm one will be the red one! You must press the green--\"  And then he, too, was interrupted.  Displaced air made a near-explosive _woosh!_ and the tunnel car was there on its pad. In it was a nightmare horror holding a limp Holly Carter across its snakelike tentacles. A free tentacle opened the door.  \"Take her while I hold my breath,\" said Harla, still talking through Teresa. \"I'll return the tunnel car empty. I can, now that I know that warmth is where the hearth is.\"  Harla dropped the unconscious girl in my arms and snapped back into the car. It disappeared, then returned empty just as the doctor was bending over Holly.         *       *       *       *       *  So now I have my Holly, but every now and then I lie awake beside her in a cold sweat. Harla could have guessed wrong. Just as Wallach and Crandall had been wrong in assuming the red button would be warmer than the green. Their reaction was as emotional as Harla's.  I hope Harla either forgives me or never finds out that I had to sound sure of myself, and that I had to play on his emotions simply to get him to take the fifty-fifty chance on his--hers--_our_ lives.  And I get to sleep only after I've convinced myself that it was more than chance ... that somehow our feelings and emotions guided Harla where logic and definition fail.  For right and left do not exist until terrestrial man defines them."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51687"],["title","The Spy in the Elevator (#0)"],["body","SPY IN THE ELEVATOR                           By DONALD E.

He threatened                to destroy everything that was noble and                 decent--including my date with my girl!   When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window sticking at full transparency--well, I won't go through the whole sorry list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put the roof on the city, as they say.  It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.  But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my mind to do it--to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this morning--right after the egg yolk--and invited myself down to her place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.  Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job, of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots, were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other Project and had blown itself up.  Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time, shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had happened--I'd broken a shoe lace--she refused to speak to me for four days.  And then the elevator didn't come.         *       *       *       *       *  Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg--I couldn't very well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment and I was hungry--and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that gaspingly transparent window--one hundred and fifty-three stories straight down to slag--I kept going over and over my prepared proposal speeches, trying to select the most effective one.  I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment. Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend that time with than you.\"  Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract for any kind of marriage other than Non-P--Non-Permanent, No Progeny.  So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment at five minutes to ten.  Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away. It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I was giving myself plenty of time.  But then the elevator didn't come.  I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't understand it.  The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.  I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.  It didn't arrive.  I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to give her advance warning that I would be late?  Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.  Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to keep us from being interrupted.  Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute late.  No matter. It didn't arrive.  I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.  I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY.         *       *       *       *       *  It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and----\"  \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she were growing very used to saying it.  It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean disconnected? Elevators don't _get_ disconnected!\" I told her.  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.  I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it, giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me _why_ the elevator is disconnected?\"  \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that----\"  \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly at her screen and parroted her responses.  But now she was actually looking at _me_.  I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have ruined my life.\"  She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"  \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you understand me?\"  She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too preoccupied to notice it at the time.  \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection, a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten o'clock. _I'm late!_\" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize what you've _done_, disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she marry me, she won't even _speak_ to me! Not now! Not after this!\"  \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"  \"I'm not shouting!\"  \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your--\"  \"You _understand_?\" I trembled with speechless fury.  She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen, revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out, sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is--\" she leaned even closer to the screen--\"there's a spy in the elevator.\"   II  It was my turn to be stunned.  I just gaped at her. \"A--a what?\"  \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think of to get him out.\"  \"Well--but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"  \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims the elevator at them.\"  That sounded impossible. \"He _aims_ the elevator?\"  \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush anybody who goes after him.\"  \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"  She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"  \"O"]]]
