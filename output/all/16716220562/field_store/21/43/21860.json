Within minutes of this discovery what remained of the military strength of the Western world was roaring through airless space toward the most likely targets of the East.  One unscathed missile base in Alaska completed a full shoot, seven missiles with fusion war-heads. The three American bases that survived at all in the Mediterranean fired what they had. Even Britain, which had already watched the fire-tails of the American missiles departing on suicide missions, managed to resurrect its own two prototype Blue Streaks from their racks, where they had moldered since the cancellation of the British missile program. One of these museum-pieces destroyed itself in launching, but the other chugged painfully across the sky, the tortoise following the flight of the hares. It arrived a full half-hour after the newer, hotter missiles. It might as well not have bothered. There was not much left to destroy.  It was fortunate for the Communists that most of the Western arsenal had already spent itself in suicide. What was left wiped out Moscow, Leningrad and nine other cities. It was even fortunate for the whole world, for this was the Apocalypse they had dreaded, every possible nuclear weapon committed. But the circumstances were such--hasty orders, often at once recalled; confusion; panic--that most were unfused, many others merely tore great craters in the quickly healing surface of the sea. The fallout was locally murderous but quite spotty.  And the conventional forces invading Russia found nothing to fight. The Russians were as confused as they. There were not many survivors of the very top brass, and no one seemed to know just what had happened.  Was the Secretary of the C.P., U.S.S.R. behind that terrible brief agony? As he was dead before it was over, there was no way to tell. More than a quarter of a billion lives went into mushroom-shaped clouds, and nearly half of them were Russian, Latvian, Tatar and Kalmuck. The Peace Commission squabbled for a month, until the breakdown of communications cut them off from their governments and each other; and in that way, for a time, there was peace.         *       *       *       *       *  This was the sort of peace that was left, thought Chandler looking around at the queer faces and queerer surroundings, the peace of medieval baronies, cut off from the world, untouched where the rain of fallout had passed by but hardly civilized any more. Even his own home town, trying to take his life in a form of law, reduced at last to torture and exile to cast him out, was not the civilization he had grown up in but something new and ugly.  There was a great deal of talk he did not understand because he could not quite hear it, though they looked at him. Then Guy, with the gun, led him up to the front of the room. They had constructed an improvised platform out of plywood panels resting on squat, heavy boxes that looked like empty ammunition crates. On the dais was a dentist's chair, bolted to the plywood; and in the chair, strapped in, baby spotlights on steel-tube frames glaring on her, was a girl. She looked at Chandler with regretting eyes but did not speak.  \"Stranger, get up there,\" said Guy, prodding him from behind, and Chandler took a plain wooden chair next to the girl.  \"People of Orphalese,\" cried the teen-age cutie named Meggie, \"we have two more brands to save from the imps!\"  The men and women in the audience cackled or shrilled \"Save them! Save them!\" They all had a look of invisible uniforms, Chandler saw, like baseball players in the lobby of a hotel or soldiers in a diner outside the gate of their post; they were all of a type. Their type was something strange. Some were tall, some short; there were old, fat, lean and young around them; but they all wore about them a look of glowing excitement, muted by an aura of suffering and pain. They wore, in a word, the look of bigots.  The bound girl was not one of them. She might have been twenty years old or as much as thirty. She might have been pretty. It was hard to tell; she wore no makeup, her hair strung raggedly to her neck, and her face was drawn into a tight, lean line. It was her eyes that were alive. She saw Chandler and she was sorry for him. And he saw, as he turned to look at her, that she was manacled to the dentist's chair.  \"People of Orphalese,\" chanted Guy, standing behind Chandler with the muzzle of the gun against his neck, \"the _meeting_ of the Orphalese Self-Preservation _Society_ will now come to _order_.\" There was an approving, hungry murmur from the audience.  \"Well, people of _Orphalese_,\" Guy went on in his singsong, \"the agenda for the day is first the salvation of we _Orphalese_ on McGuire's _Mountain_.\"  (\"All saved, all of us saved,\" rolled a murmur from the congregation.) A lean, red-headed man bounded to the platform and fussed with the stand of spotlights, turning one of them full on Chandler.  \"People of Orphalese, as we are _saved_, do I have your consent to _pass on_ and proceed to the next order of _business_?\"  (\"Consent, consent, consent,\" rolled the echo.)  \"And then the _second_ item of business is to _welcome_ and bring to grace these two newly _found_ and adopted _souls_.\"  The congregation shouted variously: \"Bring them to grace! Save them from the imps! Keep Orphalese from the taint of the beast!\"  Evidently Guy was satisfied. He nodded and became more chatty. \"Okay, people of Orphalese, let's get down to it. We got two new ones, like I say. Their spirits have gone wandering on the wind, or anyway one of them has, and you all know the et cetera. They have committed a wrong unto others and therefore unto themselves. Herself, I mean. Course, the other one could have a flame spirit in him too.\" He stared severely at Chandler. \"Boys, keep an eye on him, why don't you?\" he said to two men in the front row, surrendering his gun. \"Meggie, you tell about the female one.\"  The teen-aged girl stepped forward and said, in a conversational tone but with modest pride, \"People of Orph'lese, well, I was walking down the cut and I heard this car coming. Well, I was pretty surprised, you know. I had to figure what to do. You all know what the trouble is with cars.\"  \"The imps!\" cried a woman of forty with a face like a catfish.  The girl nodded. \"Most prob'ly. Well, I--I mean, people of Orph'lese, well, I was by the switchback where we keep the chevvy-freeze hid, so I just waited till I saw it slowing down for the curve--me out of sight, you know--and I rolled the chevvy-freeze out nice and it caught the wheels. Right over!\" she cried gleefully. \"Off the shoulder, people of Orph'lese, and into the ditch and over, and I didn't give it a chance to burn. I cut the switch and I had her! I put a knife into her back, just a little, about a quarter of an inch, maybe. Her pain was the breakin' of the shell that enclosed her understanding, like it says. I figured she was all right then because she yelled but I brought her along that way. Then Guy took care of her until we got the synod. Oh,\" she remembered, \"and her tongue staggered a little without purpose while he was putting it on, didn't it, Guy?\" The bearded man nodded, grinning, and lifted up the girl's foot. Incredulously, Chandler saw that it was bound tight with a three-foot length of barbed wire, wound and twisted like a tourniquet, the blood black and congealed around it. He lifted his shocked eyes to meet the girl's. She only looked at him, with pity and understanding.  Guy patted the foot and let it go. \"I didn't have any more C-clamps, people of Orphalese,\" he apologized, \"but it looks all right at that. Well, let's see. We got to make up our minds about these two, I guess--no, wait!\" He held up his hand as a murmur began. \"First thing is, we ought to read a verse or two.\"  He opened a purple-bound volume at random, stared at a page for a moment, moving his lips, and then read:  \"Some of you say, 'It is the north wind who has woven the clothes we wear.'  \"And I say, Ay, it was the north wind, but shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.  \"And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.\"  Gently he closed the book, looking thoughtfully at the wall at the back of the room. He scratched his head. \"Well, people of Orphalese,\" he said slowly \"they're laughing in the forest all right, I guarantee, but we've got one here that may be honest in the flesh, probably is, though she was a thief in the spirit. Right? Well, do we take her in or reject her, O people of Orphalese?\"  The audience muttered to itself and then began to call out: \"Accept! Oh, bring in the brand! Accept and drive out the imp!\"  \"Fine,\" said the teen-ager, rubbing her hands and looking at the bearded man. \"Guy, let her go.\" He began to release her from the chair. \"You, girl stranger, what's your name?\"  The girl said faintly, \"Ellen Braisted.\"  \"'_Meggie_, my name is Ellen Braisted,'\" corrected the teen-ager. \"Always say the name of the person you're talkin' to in Orph'lese, that way we know it's you talkin', not a flame spirit or wanderer. Okay, go sit down.\" Ellen limped wordlessly down into the audience. \"Oh, and people of Orph'lese,\" said Meggie, \"the car's still there if we need it for anything. It didn't burn. Guy, you go on with this other fellow.\"  Guy stroked his beard and assessed Chandler, looking him over carefully. \"Okay,\" he said. \"People of Orphalese, the _third_ order of business is to _welcome_ or reject this _other_ brand saved from the imps, as may be your _pleasure_.\" Chandler sat up straighter now that all of them were looking at him again; but it wasn't quite his turn, at that, because there was an interruption. Guy never finished. From the valley, far below, there was a sudden mighty thunder, rolling among the mountains. The windows blew in with a crystalline crash.         *       *       *       *       *  The room"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51804"],["title","Plague of Pythons (#5)"],["body","into confusion, the audience leaping from their seats, running to the broad windows, Guy and the teen-age girl seizing rifles, everyone in motion at once.  Chandler straightened, then sat down again. The red-headed man guarding him was looking away. It would be quite possible to grab his gun, run, get away from these maniacs. Yet he had nowhere to go. They might be crazy, but they seemed to have organization.  They seemed, in fact, to have worked out, on whatever crazed foundation of philosophy, some practical methods for coping with possession. He decided to stay, wait and see.  And at once he found himself leaping for the gun.  No. Chandler didn't find himself attacking the red-headed man. He found his _body_ doing it; Chandler had nothing to do with it. It was the helpless compulsion he had felt before, that had nearly cost him his life; his body active and urgent and his mind completely cut off from it. He felt his own muscles move in ways he had not planned, observed himself leap forward, felt his own fist strike at the back of the red-headed man's ear. The man went spinning, the gun went flying, Chandler's body leaped after it, with Chandler a prisoner in his own brain, watching, horrified and helpless. And he had the gun!  He caught it in the hand that was his own hand, though someone else was moving it; he raised it and half-turned. He was suddenly conscious of a fusillade of gunfire from the roof, and a scattered echo of guns all round the outside of the house. Part of him was surprised, another alien part was not. He started to shoot the teen-aged girl in the back of the head, silently shouting _No!_  His fingers never pulled the trigger.  He caught a second's glimpse of someone just beside him, whirled and saw the girl, Ellen Braisted, limping swiftly toward him with her barbed-wire amulet loose and catching at her feet. In her hands was an axe-handle club caught up from somewhere. She struck at Chandler's head, with a face like an eagle's, impersonal and determined. The blow caught him and dazed him, and from behind someone else struck him with something else. He went down.  He heard shouts and firing, but he was stunned. He felt himself dragged and dropped. He saw a cloudy, misty girl's face hanging over him; it receded and returned. Then a frightful blistering pain in his hand startled him back into full consciousness.  It was the girl, Ellen, still there, leaning over him and, oddly, weeping. And the pain in his hand was the burning flame of a kitchen match. Ellen was doing it, his wrist in one hand, a burning match held to it with the other.   IV  Chandler yelled hoarsely, jerking his hand away.  She dropped the match and jumped up, stepping on the flame and watching him. She had a butcher knife that had been caught between her elbow and her body while she burned him. Now she put her hand on the knife, waiting. \"Does it hurt?\" she demanded tautly.  Chandler howled, with incredulity and rage: \"God damn it, yes! What did you expect?\"  \"I expected it to hurt,\" she agreed. She watched him for a moment more and then, for the first time since he had seen her, she smiled. It was a small smile, but a beginning. A fusillade of shots from outside wiped it away at once. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"I had to do that. Please trust me.\"  \"_Why_ did you have to burn my hand?\"  \"House rules,\" she said. \"Keeps the flame-spirits out, you know. They can't stand pain.\" She took her hand off the knife warily, \"it still hurts, doesn't it?\"  \"It still does, yes,\" nodded Chandler bitterly, and she lost interest in him and got up, looking about the room. Three of the Orphalese were dead, or seemed to be from the casual poses in which they lay draped across a chair on the floor. Some of the others might have been freshly wounded, though it was hard to tell the casualties from the others in view of the Orphalese custom of self-inflicted pain. There was still firing going on outside and overhead, and a shooting-gallery smell of burnt powder in the air. The girl, Ellen Braisted, limped back with the butcher knife held carelessly in one hand. She was followed by the teen-ager, who wore a smile of triumph--and, Chandler noticed for the first time, a sort of tourniquet of barbed-wire on her left forearm, the flesh puffy red around it \"Whopped 'em,\" she said with glee, and pointed a .22 rifle at Chandler.  Ellen Braisted said, \"Oh, he--_Meggie_, I mean, he's all right.\" She pointed at his burned palm. Meg approached him with competent care, the rifle resting on her good right forearm and aimed at him as she examined his burn. She pursed her lips and looked at his face. \"All right, Ellen, I guess he's clean. But you want to burn 'em deeper'n that. Never pays to go easy, just means we'll have to do something else to 'im tomorrow.\"  \"The hell you will,\" thought Chandler, and all but said it; but reason stopped him. In Rome he would have to do Roman deeds. Besides, maybe their ideas worked. Besides, he had until tomorrow to make up his mind about what he wanted to do.  \"Ellen, show him around,\" ordered the teen-ager. \"I got no time myself. Shoosh! Almost got us that time, Ellen. Got to be more careful, cause the white-handed aren't clean, you know.\" She strutted away, the rifle at trail. She seemed to be enjoying herself very much.         *       *       *       *       *  The name of the girl in the barbed-wire bracelet was Ellen Braisted. She came from Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, and Chandler's first wonder was what she was doing nearly three thousand miles from home.  Nobody liked to travel much these days. One place was as bad as another, except that in the place where you were known you could perhaps count on friends and as a stranger you were probable fair game anywhere else. Of course, there was one likely reason for travel.  She didn't like to talk about it, that was clear, but that was the reason. She had been possessed. When the teen-ager trapped her car the day before she had been the tool of another's will. She had had a dozen sub-machine guns in the trunk and she had meant to deliver them to a party of hunters in a valley just south of McGuire's Mountain. Chandler said, with some effort, \"I must have been----\"  \"_Ellen_, I must have been,\" she corrected.  \"Ellen, I must have been possessed too, just now. When I grabbed the gun.\"  \"Of course. First time?\"  He shook his head. For some reason the brand on his forehead began to throb.  \"Well, then you know. Look out here, now.\"  They were at the great pier windows that looked out over the valley. Down below was the river, an arc of the railroad tracks, the wooded mountainside he had scaled. \"Over there, Chandler.\" She was pointing to the railroad bridge.  Wispy gray smoke drifted off southward toward the stream. The freight train Chandler had ridden on had been stopped, all that time, in the middle of the bridge. The explosion that blew out their windows had occurred when another train plowed into it--evidently at high speed. It seemed that one of the trains had carried some sort of chemicals. The bridge was a twisted mess.  \"A diversion, Chandler,\" said Ellen Braisted. \"They wanted us looking that way. Then they attacked from up the mountain.\"  \"Who?\"  Ellen looked surprised. \"The men that crashed the trains ... if they _are_ men. The ones who possessed me--and you--and the hunters. They don't like these Orphalese, I think. Maybe they're a little afraid of them. I think the Orphalese have a pretty good idea of how to fight them.\"  Chandler felt a sudden flash of sensation along his nerves. For a moment he thought he had been possessed again, and then he knew it for what it was. It was hope. \"Ellen, I never thought of fighting them. I thought that was given up two years ago.\"  \"So maybe you agree with me? Maybe you think it's worth while sticking with the Orphalese?\"  Chandler allowed himself the contemplation of what hope meant. To find someone in this world who had a _plan_! Whatever the plan was. Even if it was a bad plan. He didn't think specifically of himself, or the brand on his forehead or the memory of the body of his wife. What he thought of was the prospect of thwarting--not even defeating, merely hampering or annoying was enough!--the imps, the \"flame creatures,\" the pythons, devils, incubi or demons who had destroyed a world he had thought very fair.  \"If they'll have me,\" he said, \"I'll stick with them, all right! Where do I go to join?\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was not hard to join at all. Meg chattily informed him that he was already practically a member. \"Chandler, we got to watch everybody strange, you know. See why, don't you? Might have a flame spirit in 'em, no fault of theirs, but look how they could mess us up. But now we know you don't, so--What do you mean, how do we know? Cause you _did_ have one when you busted loose in there. Can't have two at a time, you know. Think we couldn't tell the difference?\"  The interrupted meeting was resumed after the place had been tidied up and the dead buried. There had been four of the hunters, and even without their sub-machine guns they had succeeded in killing eight Orphalese. But it was not all loss to the Orphalese, because two of the hunters were still alive, though wounded, and under the rules of this chessboard the captured enemy became a friend.  Guy had suffered a broken jaw in the scuffle and another man presided, a fat youth who favored a bandaged leg. He limped to his feet, grimacing and patting his leg. \"O Orphalese and brothers,\" he said, \"we have lost friends, but we have won a test. Praise the Prophet, we will be spared to win again, and to drive the imps of fire out of our world. Meggie, you going to tie these folks up?\" The girl proudly ordered one of the hunters into the spotlighted dentist's chair, another into a wing chair that was hastily moved onto the platform. The men were bleeding and hurt, but they had clearly been abandoned by their possessors. They watched with"]]]
