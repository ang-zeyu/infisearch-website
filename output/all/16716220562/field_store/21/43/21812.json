Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                   He was a vendor of dreams, purveying worlds          beyond imagination to others. Yet his doom was this:             He could not see what he must learn of his own!   Soft as the voice of a mourning dove, the telephone sounded at Rufus Sollenar's desk. Sollenar himself was standing fifty paces away, his leonine head cocked, his hands flat in his hip pockets, watching the nighted world through the crystal wall that faced out over Manhattan Island. The window was so high that some of what he saw was dimmed by low clouds hovering over the rivers. Above him were stars; below him the city was traced out in light and brimming with light. A falling star--an interplanetary rocket--streaked down toward Long Island Facility like a scratch across the soot on the doors of Hell.  Sollenar's eyes took it in, but he was watching the total scene, not any particular part of it. His eyes were shining.  When he heard the telephone, he raised his left hand to his lips. \"Yes?\" The hand glittered with utilijem rings; the effect was that of an attempt at the sort of copper-binding that was once used to reinforce the ribbing of wooden warships.  His personal receptionist's voice moved from the air near his desk to the air near his ear. Seated at the monitor board in her office, wherever in this building her office was, the receptionist told him:  \"Mr. Ermine says he has an appointment.\"  \"No.\" Sollenar dropped his hand and returned to his panorama. When he had been twenty years younger--managing the modest optical factory that had provided the support of three generations of Sollenars--he had very much wanted to be able to stand in a place like this, and feel as he imagined men felt in such circumstances. But he felt unimaginable, now.  To be here was one thing. To have almost lost the right, and regained it at the last moment, was another. Now he knew that not only could he be here today but that tomorrow, and tomorrow, he could still be here. He had won. His gamble had given him EmpaVid--and EmpaVid would give him all.  The city was not merely a prize set down before his eyes. It was a dynamic system he had proved he could manipulate. He and the city were one. It buoyed and sustained him; it supported him, here in the air, with stars above and light-thickened mist below.  The telephone mourned: \"Mr. Ermine states he has a firm appointment.\"  \"I've never heard of him.\" And the left hand's utilijems fell from Sollenar's lips again. He enjoyed such toys. He raised his right hand, sheathed in insubstantial midnight-blue silk in which the silver threads of metallic wiring ran subtly toward the fingertips. He raised the hand, and touched two fingers together: music began to play behind and before him. He made contact between another combination of finger circuits, and a soft, feminine laugh came from the terrace at the other side of the room, where connecting doors had opened. He moved toward it. One layer of translucent drapery remained across the doorway, billowing lightly in the breeze from the terrace. Through it, he saw the taboret with its candle lit; the iced wine in the stand beside it; the two fragile chairs; Bess Allardyce, slender and regal, waiting in one of them--all these, through the misty curtain, like either the beginning or the end of a dream.  \"Mr. Ermine reminds you the appointment was made for him at the Annual Business Dinner of the International Association of Broadcasters, in 1998.\"  Sollenar completed his latest step, then stopped. He frowned down at his left hand. \"Is Mr. Ermine with the IAB's Special Public Relations Office?\"  \"Yes,\" the voice said after a pause.  The fingers of Sollenar's right hand shrank into a cone. The connecting door closed. The girl disappeared. The music stopped. \"All right. You can tell Mr. Ermine to come up.\" Sollenar went to sit behind his desk.         *       *       *       *       *  The office door chimed. Sollenar crooked a finger of his left hand, and the door opened. With another gesture, he kindled the overhead lights near the door and sat in shadow as Mr. Ermine came in.  Ermine was dressed in rust-colored garments. His figure was spare, and his hands were empty. His face was round and soft, with long dark sideburns. His scalp was bald. He stood just inside Sollenar's office and said: \"I would like some light to see you by, Mr. Sollenar.\"  Sollenar crooked his little finger.  The overhead lights came to soft light all over the office. The crystal wall became a mirror, with only the strongest city lights glimmering through it. \"I only wanted to see you first,\" said Sollenar; \"I thought perhaps we'd met before.\"  \"No,\" Ermine said, walking across the office. \"It's not likely you've ever seen me.\" He took a card case out of his pocket and showed Sollenar proper identification. \"I'm not a very forward person.\"  \"Please sit down,\" Sollenar said. \"What may I do for you?\"  \"At the moment, Mr. Sollenar, I'm doing something for you.\"  Sollenar sat back in his chair. \"Are you? Are you, now?\" He frowned at Ermine. \"When I became a party to the By-Laws passed at the '98 Dinner, I thought a Special Public Relations Office would make a valuable asset to the organization. Consequently, I voted for it, and for the powers it was given. But I never expected to have any personal dealings with it. I barely remembered you people had carte blanche with any IAB member.\"  \"Well, of course, it's been a while since '98,\" Ermine said. \"I imagine some legends have grown up around us. Industry gossip--that sort of thing.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"But we don't restrict ourselves to an enforcement function, Mr. Sollenar. You haven't broken any By-Laws, to our knowledge.\"  \"Or mine. But nobody feels one hundred per cent secure. Not under these circumstances.\" Nor did Sollenar yet relax his face into its magnificent smile. \"I'm sure you've found that out.\"  \"I have a somewhat less ambitious older brother who's with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When I embarked on my own career, he told me I could expect everyone in the world to react like a criminal, yes,\" Ermine said, paying no attention to Sollenar's involuntary blink. \"It's one of the complicating factors in a profession like my brother's, or mine. But I'm here to advise you, Mr. Sollenar. Only that.\"  \"In what matter, Mr. Ermine?\"  \"Well, your corporation recently came into control of the patents for a new video system. I understand that this in effect makes your corporation the licensor for an extremely valuable sales and entertainment medium. Fantastically valuable.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"EmpaVid,\" Sollenar agreed. \"Various subliminal stimuli are broadcast with and keyed to the overt subject matter. The home receiving unit contains feedback sensors which determine the viewer's reaction to these stimuli, and intensify some while playing down others in order to create complete emotional rapport between the viewer and the subject matter. EmpaVid, in other words, is a system for orchestrating the viewer's emotions. The home unit is self-contained, semi-portable and not significantly bulkier than the standard TV receiver. EmpaVid is compatible with standard TV receivers--except, of course, that the subject matter seems thin and vaguely unsatisfactory on a standard receiver. So the consumer shortly purchases an EV unit.\" It pleased Sollenar to spell out the nature of his prize.  \"At a very reasonable price. Quite so, Mr. Sollenar. But you had several difficulties in finding potential licensees for this system, among the networks.\"  Sollenar's lips pinched out.  Mr. Ermine raised one finger. \"First, there was the matter of acquiring the patents from the original inventor, who was also approached by Cortwright Burr.\"  \"Yes, he was,\" Sollenar said in a completely new voice.  \"Competition between Mr. Burr and yourself is long-standing and intense.\"  \"Quite intense,\" Sollenar said, looking directly ahead of him at the one blank wall of the office. Burr's offices were several blocks downtown, in that direction.  \"Well, I have no wish to enlarge on that point, Mr. Burr being an IAB member in standing as good as yours, Mr. Sollenar. There was, in any case, a further difficulty in licensing EV, due to the very heavy cost involved in equipping broadcasting stations and network relay equipment for this sort of transmission.\"  \"Yes, there was.\"  \"Ultimately, however, you succeeded. You pointed out, quite rightly, that if just one station made the change, and if just a few EV receivers were put into public places within the area served by that station, normal TV outlets could not possibly compete for advertising revenue.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And so your last difficulties were resolved a few days ago, when your EmpaVid Unlimited--pardon me; when EmpaVid, a subsidiary of the Sollenar Corporation--became a major stockholder in the Transworld TV Network.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't understand, Mr. Ermine,\" Sollenar said. \"Why are you recounting this? Are you trying to demonstrate the power of your knowledge? All these transactions are already matters of record in the IAB confidential files, in accordance with the By-Laws.\"  Ermine held up another finger. \"You're forgetting I'm only here to advise you. I have two things to say. They are:  \"These transactions are on file with the IAB because they involve a great number of IAB members, and an increasingly large amount of capital. Also, Transworld's exclusivity, under the IAB By-Laws, will hold good only until thirty-three per cent market saturation has been reached. If EV is as good as it looks, that will be quite soon."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51726"],["title","Wall of Crystal, Eye of Night (#1)"],["body","that, under the By-Laws, Transworld will be restrained from making effective defenses against patent infringement by competitors. Then all of the IAB's membership and much of their capital will be involved with EV. Much of that capital is already in anticipatory motion. So a highly complex structure now ultimately depends on the integrity of the Sollenar Corporation. If Sollenar stock falls in value, not just you but many IAB members will be greatly embarrassed. Which is another way of saying EV must succeed.\"  \"I know all that! What of it? There's no risk. I've had every related patent on Earth checked. There will be no catastrophic obsolescence of the EV system.\"  Ermine said: \"There are engineers on Mars. Martian engineers. They're a dying race, but no one knows what they can still do.\"  Sollenar raised his massive head.  Ermine said: \"Late this evening, my office learned that Cortwright Burr has been in close consultation with the Martians for several weeks. They have made some sort of machine for him. He was on the flight that landed at the Facility a few moments ago.\"  Sollenar's fists clenched. The lights crashed off and on, and the room wailed. From the terrace came a startled cry, and a sound of smashed glass.  Mr. Ermine nodded, excused himself and left.  --A few moments later, Mr. Ermine stepped out at the pedestrian level of the Sollenar Building. He strolled through the landscaped garden, and across the frothing brook toward the central walkway down the Avenue. He paused at a hedge to pluck a blossom and inhale its odor. He walked away, holding it in his naked fingers.   II  Drifting slowly on the thread of his spinneret, Rufus Sollenar came gliding down the wind above Cortwright Burr's building.  The building, like a spider, touched the ground at only the points of its legs. It held its wide, low bulk spread like a parasol over several downtown blocks. Sollenar, manipulating the helium-filled plastic drifter far above him, steered himself with jets of compressed gas from plastic bottles in the drifter's structure.  Only Sollenar himself, in all this system, was not effectively transparent to the municipal anti-plane radar. And he himself was wrapped in long, fluttering streamers of dull black, metallic sheeting. To the eye, he was amorphous and non-reflective. To electronic sensors, he was a drift of static much like a sheet of foil picked by the wind from some careless trash heap. To all of the senses of all interested parties he was hardly there at all--and, thus, in an excellent position for murder.  He fluttered against Burr's window. There was the man, crouched over his desk. What was that in his hands--a pomander?  Sollenar clipped his harness to the edges of the cornice. Swayed out against it, his sponge-soled boots pressed to the glass, he touched his left hand to the window and described a circle. He pushed; there was a thud on the carpeting in Burr's office, and now there was no barrier to Sollenar. Doubling his knees against his chest, he catapulted forward, the riot pistol in his right hand. He stumbled and fell to his knees, but the gun was up.  Burr jolted up behind his desk. The little sphere of orange-gold metal, streaked with darker bronze, its surface vermicular with encrustations, was still in his hands. \"Him!\" Burr cried out as Sollenar fired.  Gasping, Sollenar watched the charge strike Burr. It threw his torso backward faster than his limbs and head could follow without dangling. The choked-down pistol was nearly silent. Burr crashed backward to end, transfixed, against the wall.         *       *       *       *       *  Pale and sick, Sollenar moved to take the golden ball. He wondered where Shakespeare could have seen an example such as this, to know an old man could have so much blood in him.  Burr held the prize out to him. Staring with eyes distended by hydrostatic pressure, his clothing raddled and his torso grinding its broken bones, Burr stalked away from the wall and moved as if to embrace Sollenar. It was queer, but he was not dead.  Shuddering, Sollenar fired again.  Again Burr was thrown back. The ball spun from his splayed fingers as he once more marked the wall with his body.  Pomander, orange, whatever--it looked valuable.  Sollenar ran after the rolling ball. And Burr moved to intercept him, nearly faceless, hunched under a great invisible weight that slowly yielded as his back groaned.  Sollenar took a single backward step.  Burr took a step toward him. The golden ball lay in a far corner. Sollenar raised the pistol despairingly and fired again. Burr tripped backward on tiptoe, his arms like windmills, and fell atop the prize.  Tears ran down Sollenar's cheeks. He pushed one foot forward ... and Burr, in his corner, lifted his head and began to gather his body for the effort of rising.  Sollenar retreated to the window, the pistol sledging backward against his wrist and elbow as he fired the remaining shots in the magazine.  Panting, he climbed up into the window frame and clipped the harness to his body, craning to look over his shoulder ... as Burr--shredded; leaking blood and worse than blood--advanced across the office.  He cast off his holds on the window frame and clumsily worked the drifter controls. Far above him, volatile ballast spilled out and dispersed in the air long before it touched ground. Sollenar rose, sobbing--  And Burr stood in the window, his shattered hands on the edges of the cut circle, raising his distended eyes steadily to watch Sollenar in flight across the enigmatic sky.         *       *       *       *       *  Where he landed, on the roof of a building in his possession, Sollenar had a disposal unit for his gun and his other trappings. He deferred for a time the question of why Burr had failed at once to die. Empty-handed, he returned uptown.  He entered his office, called and told his attorneys the exact times of departure and return and knew the question of dealing with municipal authorities was thereby resolved. That was simple enough, with no witnesses to complicate the matter. He began to wish he hadn't been so irresolute as to leave Burr without the thing he was after. Surely, if the pistol hadn't killed the man--an old man, with thin limbs and spotted skin--he could have wrestled that thin-limbed, bloody old man aside--that spotted old man--and dragged himself and his prize back to the window, for all that the old man would have clung to him, and clutched at his legs, and fumbled for a handhold on his somber disguise of wrappings--that broken, immortal old man.  Sollenar raised his hand. The great window to the city grew opaque.  Bess Allardyce knocked softly on the door from the terrace. He would have thought she'd returned to her own apartments many hours ago. Tortuously pleased, he opened the door and smiled at her, feeling the dried tears crack on the skin of his cheeks.  He took her proffered hands. \"You waited for me,\" he sighed. \"A long time for anyone as beautiful as you to wait.\"  She smiled back at him. \"Let's go out and look at the stars.\"  \"Isn't it chilly?\"  \"I made spiced hot cider for us. We can sip it and think.\"  He let her draw him out onto the terrace. He leaned on the parapet, his arm around her pulsing waist, his cape drawn around both their shoulders.  \"Bess, I won't ask if you'd stay with me no matter what the circumstances. But it might be a time will come when I couldn't bear to live in this city. What about that?\"  \"I don't know,\" she answered honestly.  And Cortwright Burr put his hand up over the edge of the parapet, between them.         *       *       *       *       *  Sollenar stared down at the straining knuckles, holding the entire weight of the man dangling against the sheer face of the building. There was a sliding, rustling noise, and the other hand came up, searched blindly for a hold and found it, hooked over the stone. The fingers tensed and rose, their tips flattening at the pressure as Burr tried to pull his head and shoulders up to the level of the parapet.  Bess breathed: \"Oh, look at them! He must have torn them terribly climbing up!\" Then she pulled away from Sollenar and stood staring at him, her hand to her mouth. \"But he _couldn't_ have climbed! We're so high!\"  Sollenar beat at the hands with the heels of his palms, using the direct, trained blows he had learned at his athletic club.  Bone splintered against the stone. When the knuckles were broken the hands instantaneously disappeared, leaving only streaks behind them. Sollenar looked over the parapet. A bundle shrank from sight, silhouetted against the lights of the pedestrian level and the Avenue. It contracted to a pinpoint. Then, when it reached the brook and water flew in all directions, it disappeared in a final sunburst, endowed with glory by the many lights which found momentary reflection down there.  \"Bess, leave me! Leave me, please!\" Rufus Sollenar cried out.   III  Rufus Sollenar paced his office, his hands held safely still in front of him, their fingers spread and rigid.  The telephone sounded, and his secretary said to him: \"Mr. Sollenar, you are ten minutes from being late at the TTV Executives' Ball. This is a First Class obligation.\"  Sollenar laughed. \"I thought it was, when I originally classified it.\"  \"Are you now planning to renege, Mr. Sollenar?\" the secretary inquired politely.  Certainly, Sollenar thought. He could as easily renege on the Ball as a king could on his coronation.  \"Burr, you scum, what have you done to me?\" he asked the air, and the telephone said: \"Beg pardon?\"  \"Tell my valet,\" Sollenar said. \"I'm going.\" He dismissed the phone. His hands cupped in front of his chest. A firm grip on emptiness might be stronger than any prize in a broken hand.  Carrying in his chest something he refused to admit was terror, Sollenar made ready for the Ball.  But only a few moments after the first dance set had ended, Malcolm Levier of the local TTV station executive staff looked over"]]]
