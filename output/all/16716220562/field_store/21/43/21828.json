He made \"thereat is\" rhyme with \"lattice\" and \"that is.\" Why did he follow \"shaven\" and \"raven\" with \"Dodo\"?  Furthermore, it had not struck me the first time I read the poem quickly that there was anything odd about a bird being named \"Isadore.\" People who keep pet grilches frequently name them after famous Reed players and Isadore is a common name.  On the other hand, it _was_ my Uncle's name. And the word \"Dodo\" didn't rhyme as it should.  I got out a magnifying glass to examine the ancient print. Sure enough, it had been tampered with. The print looked so odd to me, anyway, I hadn't noticed the part that had been changed. But it was obvious under the glass that \"Dodo\" had been substituted for a word of almost equal length. The same with \"Isadore.\"  I went over the whole poem now, carefully, to see which words had been changed. There weren't many. \"White\" in a couple of places. \"Dodo\" and \"Isadore\" wherever they occurred. An \"o\" in the line \"Perfume from an unseen cens_o_r.\" \"S\" in the line \"'Wretch,' I cried, 'Isadore hath _s_ent thee....'\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sitting back, I thought about what I had read. It made no sense at all. Was I to look for a white bird, \"grim, ungainly, ghastly\"? And what if I found him? Why was he like a raven? What was this perfume from an unseen censor? I could picture the ghost of Uncle Isadore, knowing his financial imagination, as the \"unseen censor\" because he always criticized me. Was I to look for perfume? Did he have a fortune in perfume stowed somewhere? It seemed to me it would take an awful lot of even the most expensive perfume to comprise a fortune.  I decided to start with the bird. I went outside Rene's ship and looked around. No birds.  \"Rene!\" I called. He was still looking through Uncle Izzy's ship. \"Have you seen an ungainly white bird around?\"  \"What!\" he snapped, sticking an indignant face out of the door.  \"I guess you haven't. Can your woodsy lore tell if there _are_ birds on this planet?\"  \"Obviously,\" Rene said. \"I don't know why you can't find your own spoor. I noticed the droppings immediately.\"  \"Where are the birds?\"  \"How the hell would I know?\" But he couldn't contain his special knowledge. \"They're probably night birds,\" he said.  \"Oh, yes.\" It checked. \"Wandering from the Night's Plutonian shore.\"  He looked at me suspiciously. \"You ever had a nervous breakdown?\"  \"I have _not_. I test 10:9 on job adjustment and 10:8 on life adjustment.\"  \"Some people crack on alien planets,\" he said. \"I have a padded room in my ship. You'd be surprised how often I have to use it.\"  I told him about the poem I found in Uncle Izzy's book. \"We look for a white bird,\" I said. \"Or perfume.\"  \"You're nuts,\" he pointed out with some justice, because he hadn't known Uncle Isadore. \"How do you know these changes weren't made by somebody else a long time ago? Maybe this ancient printer printed it wrong and had to change it afterward.\"  \"I don't think they were that primitive back then.\"  But I didn't know what \"back then\" meant or how primitive ancient printing was. All I knew for sure was that, as the poem stood, it sounded as if somebody had loused up a perfect Grilch Hop rhyme. And Uncle Izzy knew I was a Grilch Hop expert in Middle School and this was the only _real_ Grilch Hop rhythm in the book. What's more, Uncle Izzy could depend on me to go over that book in painstaking detail because a studs and neck clasp man has to be good on details.         *       *       *       *       *  \"All right,\" I said. \"You look your way and I'll look my way.\"  \"We're not looking any more any way today,\" Rene said, emerging from Uncle Isadore's ship loaded down with removings. \"It'll be night and below freezing in half an hour.\"  \"What do you think,\" I asked, \"a dodo would like to eat?\"  \"A _what_?\"  \"The birds. I want to put something out to attract them. Crackers or something?\"  \"I think you're crazy. If you have any idea of sitting outside to wait for them, you'll freeze to death. Not only that, there's no moon. You wouldn't be able to see your hand in front of your face.\"  \"How do the birds see?\"  \"Maybe they aren't night birds. Maybe they migrated somewhere else.\"  \"And if I use a light, it might scare them away,\" I mused. \"Well, maybe I'm not supposed to wait outside, anyway.\"  Rene went in and switched on the heat and lights.  \"Leave the outside port open,\" I said.  \"Why?\"  \"So the birds can knock.\"  \"Can _what_?\"  \"Well, it's possible,\" I said defensively. \"It won't hurt anything to leave it open.\"  \"All right,\" he consented, curving his mouth around unpleasantly, \"just to show you what a jackass you are.\"  Rene had the heat turned low, for sleeping, and the lights off, as soon as we had eaten and fed the converter. I hydrated a package of crackers so that they were full-sized but not soggy, broke them into pieces and tossed them out.  I admit I felt a little embarrassed.  I sat there in the chill quiet, on this ugly, alien world, reading \"The Dodo\" by the light of a miniature flash, so as not to disturb Rene.  Pretty soon I began to feel creepy. \"The Dodo\" is a ghastly poem. There's an insidious morbidity about it. It had sounded merely funny the first time I read it.  Now, the more I read it, the more I began to hear strange, impossible creakings and sighs, which might or might not be due to temperature changes.  The night outside was a deep, cold cup of darkness where no human thing moved.  There was a knock at the door.  I dropped the book and flashlight. Rene was up like a cat. He didn't turn on the light.  \"Who's there?\" he shouted.  There was a scratching noise at the door. Then a voice croaked, \"My name is Isadore Summers.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I reached a trembling hand for the door.  \"Wait, you fool!\" Rene cried. He picked up the flash and got his gun. \"Stand behind me and keep your hands off your gun. I know when to shoot and when not to shoot. You don't.\"  \"If it's Uncle Isadore....\"  \"I tell you you've got to leave it up to me, if you want to get off this planet alive. Now stand back and keep your mouth shut, no matter what happens.\"  He kicked the door open and stood back and to one side of it. \"Come in with your arms up!\"  There was a sort of rustling sound and in walked a huge, white, wingless bird.  \"My name,\" the dodo repeated, somewhat plaintively this time, with a glance toward the lunch compartment, \"is Isadore Summers.\"  I couldn't help it. I rolled all over the ship with laughter. Rene looked a little shamefaced, tossed his gun onto the rack and punched the lighting on.  Obviously the dodo recognized our lunch compartment from familiarity with Uncle Izzy's ship. Then he looked at the alcohol tap that led from the fuel conversion. \"Nepenthe?\" he begged.  I hesitated. \"Isn't there something,\" I asked Rene, \"about corrupting the natives of a primitive planet?\"  But Rene was sitting on his bunk, his jaw slack. \"This is the first time I've ever been made a fool of by an alcoholic bird.\"  \"If it's _just_ a bird, of course. Like a parrot....\"  I addressed the bird. \"Sir,\" I began, and caught myself, \"or perhaps madam, can you say anything else?\"  \"Nepenthe,\" the bird said firmly.  I shrugged and drew a cup. The dodo lifted the cup and drained it in one smooth gesture. This, as it turned out, was the only thing it seemed to do smoothly.  It began a wild attempt to scratch its head with one claw and remain upright. Then, abandoning all dignity, it rolled to its side and scratched furiously to satisfaction. After that, it began what looked like a hopeless attempt to right its awkward body, legs struggling in the air and back bumping around the ship.  I couldn't help remembering Uncle Izzy after a meal, slim and suave, lighting up a tapered, perfectly packed cigarene and blowing out one round, shapely smoke ring that hovered before his light, sardonic grin like a comment on his thoughts.  An uncomfortable comparison. I shook myself to life.  I righted the bird, no small problem, for he weighed almost two hundred pounds.  \"Well,\" Rene finally said, coming out of his mood, \"now that you have this bird, what are you going to do with it?\"  \"I had thought it might lead us to Uncle Izzy's fortune,\" I explained.         *       *       *       *       *  The bird obviously had no such intention. It was getting ready to take a nap.  \"A night bird,\" I told it reprovingly, \"shouldn't take a nap in the middle of the night.\"  \"All you're proving is that he has no self-respect,\" Rene pointed out. \"Why don't you look to see if he's got a note tagged to his leg or something?\"  I did. He didn't.  \"I think this whole thing is crazy,\" Rene said, \"but since he's a talking bird, you might ask him a few questions. Maybe he's trained to say something else.\"  \"Where is Uncle Izzy's fortune?\" I asked, when I had tugged at the dodo's feathers until he opened one eye.  He closed it.  \"Do you have a message for me?\"  He drew away from me irritably and closed the eye again, ruffling down into his feathers.  \"He may be keyed to respond to certain phrases. Try your uncle's name--he obviously knows that,\" Rene suggested coldly, wanting no part of this but unable to hold down the suggestion.  \"My name,\" I screamed at the somnolent dodo, \"is Isadore Summers.\"  He reared back and pecked the hell out of me.  I picked the book up off the floor and flipped through the bent pages until I found \"The Dodo.\" Maybe there'd be something in _that_.  \"Listen to this, Rene,\" I said, \"and see if you catch anything I might have missed.\"  Rene looked discomfited, but he didn't stop up his ears.  When I came"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51758"],["title","From an Unseen Censor (#3)"],["body","the part, \"'Tell me what thy lordly name is/On the Night's Plutonian shore....'\" the dodo looked up and said, \"Isadore.\"  Clearly, this was it, although I couldn't recall that any of the questions in the poem were to the point.  I got to, \"'On the morrow he will leave me/As my hopes have flown before.'/Then the bird said....\"  \"Ask me more,\" said the dodo without missing a beat.  I read on, getting excited. \"'Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe,/And forget this lost Lenore.'/Quoth the Dodo....\"  \"Give me more,\" he supplied, pointing his beak at the alcohol tap.  I gave him another cup and continued, sure that he must be going to say _something_ relevant to Uncle Izzy's fortune.  \"'Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--Tell me, tell me, I implore!' Quoth the Dodo....\"  \"Probably not,\" the dodo said, breaking the Grilch Hop rhythm at last, \"but there are perfume trees on Alvarla.\"  \"Perfume trees!\" Rene shouted. \"That bird's lying. It's impossible.\"  \"Shut up!\" I yelled at him. \"The poem's not over.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I read on, somewhat ashamed of having to say such inhospitable words to a dodo who had been, after all, cooperating with me.  \"'Take thy beak from out my heart,/And take thy form from off my door!'/Quoth the Dodo....\"  \"I was just leaving,\" the bird said, and struggled to his feet and went and stood by the door expectantly.  I got up. \"Wait!\" I commanded the bird, who couldn't do much else because the door was closed. \"Do you know what perfume trees are, Rene?\"  \"Yeah, I know what they are, and they don't grow on this planet. You can take my word for it. They need a warm, moist soil to germinate in. They need to have their soil cultivated every day for a year. They die fast on contact with any sort of industrial fumes. They die in captivity, like some wild animals. They die if you sweat on them. They die if you breathe on them. They need to start off warm and get colder every month until they form their flowers. Then they need a frost for the pods to fill with the perfume, along with the seeds.\"  \"There aren't any industrial fumes here,\" I pointed out, \"and they could get plenty of frost.\"  \"That's all they'd get. Where's the warm, moist climate to germinate in? Where's the parasitical Rhns to cultivate their soil? The Rhns couldn't exist without their Gleees and the Gleees can't exist without--never mind. The only place perfume trees can grow is on Odoria and that's why the perfume is worth two thousand dollars an ounce.\"  \"I have never heard of anything,\" I informed him, \"that spelled 'Uncle Isadore' so exactly. He always said, 'If it can't be done, I can do it.' Well, there's only one way to find out. Surely there's something on the ship I can wear.\"  \"You mean you're going out into that frozen inkpot after that idiotic bird?\"  \"That's exactly what I mean.\"  \"For Pete's sake! You're as brainless as the bird is!\" But I think, for all his attitude, he was curious, too.         *       *       *       *       *  He began to spray me with something. \"Close your eyes and mouth. If you don't wash this off with soap and water in twenty-four hours, you'll die. But it sure keeps in the body heat.\"  I stuck the book in my pocket for good luck, and Rene handed me a gun, some lunch packages, an antibiotic kit and a water purification kit.  \"All right,\" I said, pocketing them, \"but it can't be far. Uncle Izzy wouldn't have gone more than a day's journey.\"  \"Then why haven't we smelled the perfume? And why would he have gone through all this rigmarole when he must have known you'd search that far?\"  I didn't know why.  I pushed the door open. The bird hopped out and I realized how easy it would be to lose him from the small, round glow of my flash.  He looked curiously at me, as though expecting something further.  I looked curiously at him, wondering where he would lead to.  Then he was off. There was no question of following him. That big, awkward bird ran so fast that in a few minutes we could no longer hear the beat of his huge claws on the rocks, even in the perfectly still, dry air.  \"How fast do you figure he's going?\" I asked Rene.  \"How the hell would I know?\"  \"Roughly.\"  \"Roughly? Maybe fifty miles an hour.\"  \"But that's incredible!\"  \"The big point-tails on Aldebaran kappa can do eighty with a native on their backs.\"  \"Ah!\" I said. \"So _that's_ it! Maybe tomorrow night....\"  But we could hear the drumming of the returning dodo.  \"Don't be stupid,\" Rene said. \"He can't carry both of us and you'd be a fool either to go alone or stay here alone.\"  \"As a tribute to my deceased uncle, I'm going to be a fool.\"  I stuck my flashlight into one of my many pockets and climbed onto the huge bird's back. The down beneath his outer feathers was as soft and strong as heavy fur. I dug in with my hands and feet, my head braced against the thickened part of his neck.  He started off with a lurch that brought my stomach out of hiding. I kept my eyes squeezed closed. I couldn't have seen anything, anyway. Not even the impossible creature that was rushing through the darkness carrying me, for all I knew, straight to damnation.  The night rushed past my ears in a wild keening and it crossed my mind to wonder what Mr. Picks, my supervisor, would say if he saw me now.  I had a sudden vision of Mr. Picks, even more neatly dressed than I always was, with middle-cost neck clasp and stud discreetly shining from a plain, square-edged bag shirt and dun suit. I pictured him opening a refined little box and holding it two feet under the customer's eyes with a gesture of faint, unconscious supplication. A comfortable, warm, happy picture in which my place, one counter behind Mr. Picks, was reassuringly assured.  Then, out of nowhere, into the picture galloped a yellow-skinned monster astride a huge, white bird. It turned out to be me and I tumbled off the bird, crying, \"Mr. Picks! I don't know what came over me!\"  But I was answered only by a multitude of squawks, rustles and scratchings.  The bird was home.         *       *       *       *       *  I could almost see vague forms. The darkness was beginning to give a little. I was warm, itchy and uncomfortable under whatever it was that Rene had sprayed on me.  Warm?  Perfume trees?  All I could smell were bird roosts.  I stood up, finding my limbs weak, trembling and painful. First, I glanced at my watch. Five hours terran time since we left the ship. At fifty miles per hour, we'd have gone two hundred and fifty miles.  If we'd gone due north, as the bird started out, we must be in the snow zone. And I was _warm_!  I switched my flash around. All I could see were birds. There seemed to be hundreds of them. I couldn't tell which one was my bearer.  \"Where is the perfume?\" I bawled.  All I got was squawks. Some of the birds were, in fact, standing on one foot and tucking their heads away.  It was growing lighter. The birds were going to bed.  Feverishly, I pulled out Uncle Izzy's old volume of poetry.  Brushing from my mind a vision of Mr. Picks in a state of shock and another picture of Uncle Isadore snickering triumphantly, I stood on that desert land enchanted--on that home by horror haunted, and solemnly read \"The Dodo\" to a colony of wingless birds.  My dodo identified himself at the proper place, but I kept on, waiting for something to show me my inheritance.  \"Then methought the air grew denser,\" I read.  \"Perfume from an unseen censor!\" a bird croaked from the back row.  \"Where?\" I cried, pushing my way through the birds crowding around me in various stages of roost and curiosity.  \"Then,\" I repeated, \"the air grew denser.\"  \"Perfume,\" the bird now in front of me said, \"from an unseen censor.\"  He began to scratch at the ground assiduously under one of four dim shapes about the level of my eyes. Then he yawned gapingly, gave up and went to sleep.  I sat down to wait, because it was almost dawn and the last dodo had tucked his head into his feathers.  Daylight showed me four little trees, nothing like the usual scraggy vegetation of Alvarla. They _must_ be perfume trees, I thought. But they were too young to have blossoms or pods.  I didn't go too near them, remembering what Rene had said.  And, remembering that, I began to figure out how they grew here.         *       *       *       *       *  This place was a little valley. No, a crater. Several feet deeper than my height, with sloping sides. The birds apparently kept it warm with their body heat, plus the heat the rocky sides would store. Since it was a crater, the winds wouldn't reach it. The crater made a basin to catch the snow which I could see beginning to melt at the edges and ooze down the slope.  The birds provided more than ample fertilizer and Uncle Izzy had apparently trained at least one of them to cultivate the soil under the trees.  I climbed out of the crater to see that I was indeed in the regions of snow. To the north were huge drifts, and far off loomed towering glaciers.  To the south, the hills tapered off from white to spotted brown.  That was the reason for Uncle Izzy's crazy setup. Rene and I would never have come across this crater in an ordinary search. Of course, the setup needn't have been _quite_ so crazy. That was the personal equation of which Uncle Izzy was so fond.  The trees would, I assumed, poke their heads up over the crater as they grew, reaching toward the cold, and finally getting the frostbite to fill their pods properly.  At two thousand dollars an ounce.  I had neglected to ask Rene how many pods a tree could be expected to produce or how big the pods were. But, say, half an ounce in each pod and a conservative fifty pods on each tree.  A hundred thousand dollars.  I slid back into the crater, sat leaning against a somnolent dodo and ate a lunch package with a cupful of melted snow.  All sorts of thoughts were jostling my brain.  But I was bone-weary. I hadn't slept since we hit Alvarla and the ride last night had been a tremendous strain, because "]]]
