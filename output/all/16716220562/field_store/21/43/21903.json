It was larger than the stars around it, but many of them were nearly as bright.  A high-pitched male voice said: \"Citizen Germyn, good morning.\"  Germyn was caught off balance. He took his eyes off the sky, half turned, glanced at the face of the person who had spoken to him, raised his hand in the assurance-of-identity sign. It was all very quick and fluid--almost too quick, for he had had his fingers bent nearly into the sign for female friends and this was a man. Citizen Boyne. Germyn knew him well; they had shared the Ice Viewing at Niagara a year before.  Germyn recovered quickly enough, but it had been disconcerting.  He improvised swiftly: \"There are stars, but are stars still there if there is no Sun?\" It was a hurried effort, he grieved, but no doubt Boyne would pick it up and carry it along. Boyne had always been very good, very graceful.  Boyne did no such thing. \"Good morning,\" he said again, faintly. He glanced at the stars overhead, as though trying to unravel what Germyn was talking about. He said accusingly, his voice cracking sharply: \"There isn't any Sun, Germyn. What do you think of that?\"  Germyn swallowed. \"Citizen, perhaps you--\"  \"No Sun, you hear me!\" the man sobbed. \"It's cold, Germyn. The Pyramids aren't going to give us another Sun, do you know that? They're going to starve us, freeze us; they're through with us. We're done, all of us!\" He was nearly screaming.  All up and down Pine Street, people were trying not to look at him and some of them were failing.  Boyne clutched at Germyn helplessly. Revolted, Germyn drew back--_bodily contact!_  It seemed to bring the man to his senses. Reason returned to his eyes. He said: \"I--\" He stopped, stared about him. \"I think I'll have bread for breakfast,\" he said foolishly, and plunged into the stall.  Boyne left behind him a shaken Citizen, caught halfway into the wrist-flip of parting, staring after him with jaw slack and eyes wide, as though Germyn had no manners, either.  All this on Sun Re-creation Day!  What could it mean? Germyn wondered fretfully, worriedly.  Was Boyne on the point of--  Could Boyne be about to--  Germyn drew back from the thought. There was one thing that might explain Boyne's behavior. But it was not a proper speculation for one Citizen to make about another.  All the same--Germyn dared the thought--all the same, it _did_ seem almost as though Citizen Boyne were on the point of--well, running amok.         *       *       *       *       *  At the oatmeal stall, Glenn Tropile thumped on the counter. The laggard oatmeal vendor finally brought the ritual bowl of salt and the pitcher of thin milk. Tropile took his paper twist of salt from the top of the neatly arranged pile in the bowl. He glanced at the vendor. His fingers hesitated. Then, quickly, he ripped the twist of paper into his oatmeal and covered it to the permitted level with the milk.  He ate quickly and efficiently, watching the street outside.  They were wandering and mooning about, as always--maybe today more than most days, since they hoped it would be the day the Sun blossomed flame once more.  Tropile always thought of the wandering, mooning Citizens as _they_. There was a _we_ somewhere for Tropile, no doubt, but Tropile had not as yet located it, not even in the bonds of the marriage contract.  He was in no hurry. At the age of fourteen, Glenn Tropile had reluctantly come to realize certain things about himself--that he disliked being bested, that he had to have a certain advantage in all his dealings, or an intolerable itch of the mind drove him to discomfort. The things added up to a terrifying fear, gradually becoming knowledge, that the only we that could properly include him was one that it was not very wise to join.  He had realized, in fact, that he was a Wolf.  For some years, Tropile had struggled against it, for Wolf was an obscene word; the children he played with were punished severely for saying it, and for almost nothing else.  It was not _proper_ for one Citizen to advantage himself at the expense of another; Wolves did that.  It was _proper_ for a Citizen to accept what he had, not to strive for more, to find beauty in small things, to accommodate himself, with the minimum of strain and awkwardness, to whatever his life happened to be.  Wolves were not like that. Wolves never meditated, Wolves never Appreciated, Wolves _never_ were Translated--that supreme fulfillment, granted only to those who succeeded in a perfect meditation, that surrender of the world and the flesh by taking leave of both, which could never be achieved by a Wolf.  Accordingly, Glenn Tropile had tried very hard to do all the things that Wolves could not do.  He had nearly succeeded. His specialty, Water Watching, had been most rewarding. He had achieved many partly successful meditations on Connectivity.  And yet he was still a Wolf, for he still felt that burning, itching urge to triumph and to hold an advantage. For that reason, it was almost impossible for him to make friends among the Citizens; and gradually he had almost stopped trying.  Tropile had arrived in Wheeling nearly a year before, making him one of the early settlers in point of time. And yet there was not a Citizen in the street who was prepared to exchange recognition gestures with him.  _He_ knew _them_, nearly every one. He knew their names and their wives' names. He knew what northern states they had moved down from with the spreading of the ice, as the sun grew dim. He knew very nearly to the quarter of a gram what stores of sugar and salt and coffee each one of them had put away--for their guests, of course, not for themselves; the well-bred Citizen hoarded only for the entertainment of others.  Tropile knew these things because there was an advantage in knowing them. But there was no advantage in having anyone know him.  A few did--that banker, Germyn; Tropile had approached him only a few months before about a prospective loan. But it had been a chancy, nervous encounter. The idea was so luminously simple to Tropile--organize an expedition to the coal mines that once had flourished nearby, find the coal, bring it to Wheeling, heat the houses. And yet it had seemed blasphemous to Germyn. Tropile had counted himself lucky merely to have been refused the loan, instead of being cried out upon as Wolf.         *       *       *       *       *  The oatmeal vendor was fussing worriedly around his neat stack of paper twists in the salt bowl.  Tropile avoided the man's eyes. Tropile was not interested in the little wry smile of self-deprecation which the vendor would make to him, given half a chance. Tropile knew well enough what was disturbing the vendor. Let it disturb him. It was Tropile's custom to take extra twists of salt. They were in his pockets now; they would stay there. Let the vendor wonder why he was short.  Tropile licked the bowl of his spoon and stepped into the street. He was comfortably aware under a double-thick parka that the wind was blowing very cold.  A Citizen passed him, walking alone: odd, thought Tropile. He was walking rapidly and there was a look of taut despair on his face. Still more odd. Odd enough to be worth another look, because that sort of haste, that sort of abstraction, suggested something to Tropile. They were in no way normal to the gentle sheep of the class _They_, except in one particular circumstance.  Glenn Tropile crossed the street to follow the abstracted Citizen, whose name, he knew, was Boyne. The man blundered into Citizen Germyn outside the baker's stall, and Tropile stood back out of easy sight, watching and listening.  Boyne was on the ragged edge of breakdown. What Tropile heard and saw confirmed his diagnosis. The one particular circumstance was close to happening--Citizen Boyne was on the verge of running amok.  Tropile looked at the man with amusement and contempt. Amok! The gentle sheep _could_ be pushed too far. He had seen Citizens run amok, the signs were obvious.  There was pretty sure to be an advantage in it for Glenn Tropile. There was an advantage in almost anything, if you looked for it.  He watched and waited. He picked his spot with care, so that he could see Citizen Boyne inside the baker's stall, making a dismal botch of slashing his quarter-kilo of bread from the Morning Loaf.  He waited for Boyne to come racing out....  Boyne did.  A yell--loud, piercing. It was Citizen Germyn, shrilling: \"Amok, amok!\" A scream. An enraged wordless cry from Boyne, and the baker's knife glinting in the faint light as Boyne swung it. And then Citizens were scattering in every direction--all of the Citizens but one.  One Citizen was under the knife--his own knife, as it happened; it was the baker himself. Boyne chopped and chopped again. And then Boyne came out, roaring, the broad knife whistling about his head. The gentle Citizens fled panicked before him. He struck at their retreating forms and screamed and struck again. Amok.  It was the one particular circumstance when they forgot to be gracious--one of the two, Tropile corrected himself as he strolled across to the baker's stall. His brow furrowed, because there was another circumstance when they lacked grace, and one which affected him nearly.         *       *       *       *       *  He watched the maddened creature, Boyne, already far down the road, chasing a knot of Citizens around a corner. Tropile sighed and stepped into the baker's stall to see what he might gain from this.  Boyne would wear himself out--the surging rage would leave him as quickly as it came; he would be a sheep again and the other sheep would close in and capture him. That was what happened when a Citizen ran amok. It was a measure of what pressures were on the Citizens that, at any moment, there might be one gram of pressure too much and one of them would crack. It had happened here"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51845"],["title","Wolfbane (#3)"],["body"," Wheeling twice within the past two months. Glenn Tropile had seen it happen in Pittsburgh, Altoona and Bronxville.  There is a limit to the pressure that can be endured.  Tropile walked into the baker's stall and looked down without emotion at the slaughtered baker. The corpse was a gory mess, but Tropile had seen corpses before.  He looked around the stall, calculating. As a starter, he bent to pick up the quarter-kilo of bread Boyne had dropped, dusted it off and slipped it into his pocket. Food was always useful. Given enough food, perhaps Boyne would not have run amok.  Was it simple hunger they cracked under? Or the knowledge of the thing on Mount Everest, or the hovering Eyes, or the sought-after-dreaded prospect of Translation, or merely the strain of keeping up their laboriously figured lives?  Did it matter? _They_ cracked and ran amok, and Tropile never would, and that was what mattered.  He leaned across the counter, reaching for what was left of the Morning Loaf--  And found himself staring into the terrified large eyes of Citizeness Germyn.  She screamed: \"Wolf! Citizens, help me! Wolf!\"  Tropile faltered. He hadn't even _seen_ the damned woman, but there she was, rising up from behind the counter, screaming her head off: \"Wolf! Wolf!\"  He said sharply: \"Citizeness, I beg you--\" But that was no good. The evidence was on him and her screams would fetch others.  Tropile panicked. He started toward her to silence her, but that was no good, either. He whirled. She was screaming, screaming, and there were people to hear. Tropile darted into the street, but they were popping out of every doorway now, appearing from each rat's hole in which they had hid to escape Boyne.  \"Please!\" he cried, sobbing. \"Wait a minute!\"  But they weren't waiting. They had heard the woman and maybe some of them had seen him with the bread. They were all around him--no, they were all over him; they were clutching at him, tearing at his soft, warm furs.  They pulled at his pockets and the stolen twists of salt spilled accusingly out. They yanked at his sleeves and even the stout, unweakened seams ripped open. He was fairly captured.  \"Wolf!\" they were shouting. \"Wolf!\" It drowned out the distant noise from where Boyne had finally been run to earth, a block and more away. It drowned out everything.  It was the other circumstance when _they_ forgot to be gracious: when they had trapped a Son of the Wolf.   III  Engineering had long ago come to an end.  Engineering is possible under one condition of the equation: Total available Calories divided by Population equals Artistic-Technological Style. When the ratio Calories-to-Population is large--say, five thousand or more, five thousand daily calories for every living person--then the Artistic-Technological Style is _big_. People carve Mount Rushmore; they build great foundries; they manufacture enormous automobiles to carry one housewife half a mile for the purchase of one lipstick.  Life is coarse and rich where C:P is large. At the other extreme, where C:P is too small, life does not exist at all. It has starved out.  Experimentally, add little increments to C:P and it will be some time before the right-hand side of the equation becomes significant. But at last, in the 1,000 to 1,500 calorie range, Artistic-Technological Style firmly appears in self-perpetuating form. C:P in that range produces the small arts, the appreciations, the peaceful arrangements of necessities into subtle relationships of traditionally agreed-upon virtue.  Think of Japan, locked into its Shogunate prison, with a hungry population scrabbling food out of mountainsides and beauty out of arrangements of lichens. The small, inexpensive sub-sub-arts are characteristic of the 1,000 to 1,500 calorie range.  And this was the range of Earth, the world of ten billion men, when the planet was stolen by its new binary.  Some few persons inexpensively studied the study of science with pencil and renewable paper, but the last research accelerator had long since been shut down. The juice from its hydro-power dam was needed to supply meager light to a million homes and to cook the pablum for two million brand-new babies.  In those days, one dedicated Byzantine wrote the definitive encyclopedia of engineering (though he was no engineer). Its four hundred and twenty tiny volumes examined exhaustively the engineering feats of ancient Greece and Egypt, the Wall of Shih-Hwang Ti, the Gothic builders, Brunel who changed the face of England, the Roeblings of Brooklyn, Groves of the Pentagon, Duggan of the Shelter System (before C:P dropped to the point where war became vanishingly implausible), Levern of Operation Up. But the encyclopedist could not use a slide rule without thinking, faltering, jotting down his decimals.  And then ... the magnitudes grew less.  Under the tectonic and climatic battering of the great abduction of Earth from its primary, under the sine-wave advances to and retreats from the equator of the ice sheath, as the small successor Suns waxed, waned, died and were replaced, the ratio C:P remained stable. C had diminished enormously; so had P. As the calories to support life grew scarce, so the consuming mouths of mankind grew less in number.         *       *       *       *       *  The forty-fifth small Sun shone on no engineers.  Not even on the binary, perhaps. The Pyramids, the things on the binary, the thing on Mount Everest--they were not engineers. They employed a crude metaphysic based on dissection and shoving.  They had no elegant field theories. All they knew was that everything came apart, and that if you pushed a thing, it would move.  If your biggest push would not move a thing, you took it apart and pushed the parts, and then it would move. Sometimes, for nuclear effects, they had to take things apart into 3 × 10^9 pieces and shove each piece very carefully.  By taking apart and shoving, then, they landed their one spaceship on the burned-out sunlet. Four human beings were on that ship. They meditated briefly on Connectivity and died screaming.  A point of new flame appeared on the sunlet's surface and the spaceship scrambled for the binary. The point of flame went from cherry through orange into the blue-white and began to spread.         *       *       *       *       *  At the moment of the Re-creation of the Sun, there was rejoicing on the Earth.  Not quite everywhere, though. In Wheeling's House of the Five Regulations, Glenn Tropile waited unquietly for death. Citizen Boyne, who had run amok and slaughtered the baker, shared Tropile's room and his doom, but not his rage. Boyne, with demure pleasure, was composing his death poem.  \"Talk to me!\" snapped Tropile. \"Why are we here? What did you do and why did you do it? What have I done? Why don't I pick up a bench and kill you with it? You would've killed me two hours ago if I'd caught your eye!\"  There was no satisfaction in Citizen Boyne; the passions were burned out of him. He politely tendered Tropile a famous aphorism: \"Citizen, the art of living is the substitution of unimportant, answerable questions for important, unanswerable ones. Come, let us appreciate the new-born Sun.\"  He turned to the window, where the spark of blue-white flame in what had once been the crater of Tycho was beginning to spread across the charred moon.  Tropile was child enough of his culture to turn with him, almost involuntarily. He was silent. That blue-white infinitesimal up there growing slowly--the oneness, the calm rapture of Being in a universe that you shaded into without harsh discontinua, the being one with the great blue-white gem-flower blossoming now in the heavens that were no different stuff than you yourself--  He closed his eyes, calm, and meditated on Connectivity.  He was being Good.  By the time the fusion reaction had covered the whole small disk of the sunlet, a quarter-hour at the most, his meditation began to wear off.  Tropile shrugged out of his torn parka, not bothering to rip it further. It was already growing warm in the room. Citizen Boyne, of course, was carefully opening every seam with graceful rending motions, miming great and smooth effort of the biceps and trapezius.  But the meditation was over, and as Tropile watched his cellmate, he screamed a silent _Why?_ Since his adolescence, that wailing syllable had seldom been far from his mind. It could be silenced by appreciation and meditation.  Tropile's specialty was Water Watching and he was so good at it that several beginners had asked him for instruction in the subtle art, in spite of his notorious oddities of life and manner. He _enjoyed_ Water Watching. He almost pitied anybody so single-mindedly devoted to, say, Clouds and Odors--great game though it was--that he had never even tried Water Watching. And after a session of Watching, when one was lucky enough to observe the Nine Boiling Stages in classic perfection, one might slip into meditation and be harmonious, feel Good.  But what did one do when the meditations failed, as they had failed him? What did one do when they came farther and farther apart, became less and less intense, could be inspired, finally, only by a huge event like the renewal of the Sun?  One went amok, he had always thought.  But he had not. Boyne had. He had been declared a Son of the Wolf, on no evidence that he could understand. Yet he had not run amok.  Still, the penalties were the same, he thought, uncomfortably aware of an unfamiliar itch--not the inward intolerable itch of needing the advantage, but a localized sensation at the base of his spine. The penalties for all gross crimes--Wolfhood or running amok--were the same, and simply this:  They would perform the Lumbar Puncture. He would make the Donation of Spinal Fluid.  He would be dead.         *       *       *       *       *  The Keeper of the House of Five Regulations, an old man, Citizen Harmane, looked in on his charges--approvingly at Boyne, with a beclouded expression at "]]]
