She might be lonely....  Nodalictha smiled at him. The process would have been horrifying to a human who watched, but Rhadampsicus smiled back.  \"Lonely?\" asked Nodalictha coyly. \"With you, Rhadampsicus?\"  He impulsively twined his eye stalks about hers. A little later he was saying tenderly, \"Then I'll just finish my observations, darling, and we'll go on--since you don't mind waiting.\"  \"I'd like to see my pets again,\" said Nodalictha, nestling comfortably against him.  Together, they scanned the second planet, but their thoughts could not penetrate its _Rhinthak_ screen. They saw the space yacht flash up to it. Rhadampsicus inspected the minds of the bipeds inside it. Nodalictha, of course, modestly refrained from entering the minds of male creatures other than her husband.  \"Peculiar,\" commented Rhadampsicus. \"Very peculiar. If I were a sociologist, I might find it less baffling. But they must have a very queer sort of social system. They actually intend to harm your pets, Nodalictha, because the male now knows how to supply them all with food and energy! Isn't that strange? I wish the _Rhinthak_ screen did not block off scanning.... But it will fade, presently.\"  \"You will keep the others from harming my pets,\" said Nodalictha confidently. \"Do you know, darling, I think I must be quite the luckiest person in the Galaxy, to be married to you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The space yacht landed at the field outside Cetopolis. Inhabitants of the tiny town flocked to the field to see new faces. They were disappointed. One man came out and the airlock closed. No visitors.  The skipper went into Carson's office. He closed the door firmly behind him. He had very beady eyes and a very hard-boiled expression. He looked at Carson with open contempt, and Carson felt that it was because Carson did the Company's dirty work with figures and due regard for law and order, instead of frankly and violently and without shilly-shallying.  \"This Lon Simpson's got those gadgets, eh?\" asked the skipper.  \"Why--yes,\" said Carson unhappily. \"He's very popular at the moment. He made something on his barn roof that kept the sun from burning us all to death, you know--that still keeps us from burning to death, for that matter.\"  \"So if we take it away or smash it,\" observed the skipper, \"we don't have to worry about anybody saying nasty things about us afterward. Yeah?\"  Carson swallowed.  \"Everybody'd die if you smashed the gadget,\" he admitted, \"but all the _thanar_ plants in existence would be burned up, too. There'd be no more _thanar_. The Company wouldn't like that.\"  The skipper waved his hand. \"How do I get this Simpson on my ship? Take a bunch of my men and go grab him?\"  \"Wh-what are you going to do with him?\"  \"Don't you worry,\" said the skipper comfortingly. \"We know how to handle it. He knows how to make some things the bosses want to know how to make. Once I get him on the ship, he'll tell. We got ways. Do I take some men and grab him, or will you get him on board peaceable?\"  \"There--ah--\" Carson licked his lips. \"He wants to get married. There's no provision in the legal code for it, as yet. It was overlooked. But I can tell him that as a ship captain, you--\"  The skipper nodded matter of factly.  \"Right. You get him and the girl on board. And I've got some orders for you. Gather up plenty of _thanar_ seed. Get some starting trays with young plants in them. I'll come back in a couple of days and take you and them on board. The stuff this guy has got is too good, understand?\"  \"N-no. I'm afraid I don't.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I get this guy to tell us how to make his gadgets,\" the skipper explained contemptuously. \"We make sure he tells us right. To be extra sure, we leave the gadgets he's got made and working back here, where he can't get to 'em and spoil 'em. But when we know all he knows--and what he only guesses, too, and my tame scientists have made the same kinda gadgets, an' they work--why, we come back and pick you up, and the _thanar_ seed and the young growing plants. Then we get the gadgets this guy made here, and we head back for Earth.\"  \"But if you take the gadget that keeps us all from being burned up--\" Carson said agitatedly, \"if you do, everybody here--\"  \"Won't that be too bad!\" the skipper said ironically. \"But you won't be here. You'll be on the yacht. Don't worry. Now go fix it for the girl and him to walk into our parlor.\"  Carson's hand shook as he reached for the beamphone. His voice was not quite normal as he explained to Cathy in the exchange that the skipper of the space yacht had the legal power to perform marriage ceremonies in space. And Carson, as a gesture of friendship to one of the most prominent colonists, had asked if the captain would oblige Cathy and Lon. The captain had agreed. If they made haste, he would take them out in space and marry them.  The skipper of the space yacht regarded him with undisguised scorn when he hung up the phone and mopped his face.  \"Pretty girl, eh?\" he asked contemptuously, \"and you didn't have the nerve to grab her for yourself?\" He did not wait for an answer. \"I'll look her over. You get your stuff ready for when I come back in a couple of days.\"  \"But--when you release them,\" Carson said shakily, \"They'll report--\"  The skipper looked at Carson without any expression at all. Then he went out.  Carson felt sick. But he was a very loyal employee of the Cetis Gamma Trading Company. From the windows of his air-conditioned office, he watched Lon Simpson greet Cathy on his arrival in Cetopolis. He saw Cathy put a sprig of _chanel_ blossoms on the lapel of her very best suit, in lieu of a bridal bouquet. And he watched them go with shining faces toward the airport. He didn't try to stop them.  Later he heard the space yacht take off.         *       *       *       *       *  Nodalictha prepared to share the thoughts and the happiness of the female biped whose emotions were familiar, since Nodalictha was so recently a bride herself. Rhadampsicus was making notes, but he gallantly ceased when Nodalictha called to him. They sat, then, before their crude but comfortable bower on the ninth planet, all set to share the quaint rejoicing of the creatures of which Nodalictha had grown fond.  Nodalictha penetrated the thoughts of the female, in pleased anticipation. Rhadampsicus scanned the mind of the male, and his expression changed. He shifted his thought to another and another of the bipeds in the ship's company. He spoke with some distaste.  \"The ones you consider your pets, Nodalictha, are amiable enough. But the others--\" He frowned. \"Really, darling, if you went into their minds, you'd be most displeased. They are quite repulsive. Let's forget about them and start for home. If you really care for pets, we've much more suitable creatures there.\"  Nodalictha pouted.  \"Rhadampsicus, let's just watch their marriage ceremony. It is so cute to think of little creatures like that loving each other--and marrying--\"  Rhadampsicus withdrew his thought from the space yacht and looked about the charming rural retreat he and Nodalictha had occupied. Its nitrogen-snow walls glittered in the starlight. The garden of cyanogen flowers and the border of ammonia crystals and the walkway of monoclinic sulphur, and the reflection pool of liquid hydrogen he'd installed in an odd half hour. These were simple, but they were delightful. The crudity of the space yacht with its metal walls so curiously covered over with a coating of lead oxide in hardened oil, and the vegetable gum flooring.... Rhadampsicus did not like the surroundings men made for themselves in space.  \"Very well, darling,\" he said resignedly. \"We will watch, and then we'll take off for home. I'm anxious to see what the modernists have to say when I show them my notes on this flare-up.--And of course,\" he added with grave humor, \"you want to show your family that I haven't ill-treated you.\"  He was the barest trace impatient, but Nodalictha's thoughts were with the female biped in the spaceship. Her expression was distressed.  \"Rhadampsicus!\" she said angrily. \"The other bipeds are being unkind to my pets! Do something! I don't like them!\"         *       *       *       *       *  A sailor in a soiled uniform led them into the space yacht's saloon. The airlock clanked shut, and the yacht soared for the skies. The sailor vanished. Nobody else came near. Then Lon stiffened. He got the flavor of his surroundings. He had Cathy with him. On her account, his flesh crawled suddenly.  This was a space yacht, but of a very special kind. It was a pleasure ship. The decorations were subtly disgusting. There were pictures on the walls, and at first glance they were pretty enough, but on second glance they were disquieting, and when carefully examined they were elaborately and allusively monstrous. This was the yacht of someone denying that anything could be more desirable than pleasure--and who took his pleasure in a most unattractive fashion.  Lon grasped this much, and it occurred to him that the crew of such a yacht would be chosen for its willingness to co√∂perate in its owner's enterprises. And Lon went somewhat pale, for Cathy was with him.  The ship went up and up, with the dark shutters over the ports showing that it was in sunshine fierce enough to be dangerous on unshielded flesh. Presently there was the feel of maneuvering. After a time the shutters flipped open and stars were visible.  Lon went quickly to a port and looked out. The great black mass of the night side of Cetis Gamma Two filled half the firmament. It blotted out the sun. The space yacht might be two or three thousand miles up and in the planet's umbra--its shadow--which was not necessary for a space wedding, or for anything involving a reasonably brief stay in the excessive heat Cetis Gamma gave off.  There were clankings. A"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51102"],["title","The Sentimentalists (#8)"],["body"," opened. The skipper came in and Cathy smiled at him because she didn't realize Lon's fierce apprehension. Four other men followed, all in soiled and untidy space yacht uniforms, then two other men in more ordinary clothing. Their expressions were distinctly uneasy.  The four sailors walked matter of factly over to Lon and grabbed at him. They should have taken him completely by surprise, but he had been warned just enough to explode into battle. It was a very pretty fight, for a time. Lon kept three of them busy. One snarled with a wrenched wrist, another spat blood and teeth and a third had a closed eye before the fourth swung a chair. Then Lon hit something with his head. It was the deck, but he didn't know it.         *       *       *       *       *  When he came to, he was hobbled. He was not bound so he couldn't move, but his hands were handcuffed together, with six inches of chain between for play. His ankles were similarly restricted. He could move, but he could not fight. Blood was trickling down his temple and somebody was holding his head up.  The skipper said impatiently, \"All right, stand back.\"  Lon's head was released. The skipper jerked a thumb. Men went out. Lon looked about desperately for Cathy. She was there--dead white and terrified, but apparently unharmed. She stared at Lon in wordless pleading.  \"You're a suspicious guy, aren't you?\" asked the skipper sardonically. \"Somebody lays a finger on you and you start fighting. But you've got the idea. I'll say it plain so we can get moving. You're Lon Simpson. Carson, down on the planet, reported some nice news about you. You made a gadget that converts any sort of leaf to _thanar_. Maybe it turns stuff to other stuff, too.\" He paused. \"We want to know how to make gadgets like that. You're gonna draw plans an' explain the theory. I got guys here to listen. We're gonna make one, from your plans an' explanations, an' it'd better work. See?\"  \"Carson sent for you to do this,\" Lon Simpson said thickly.  \"He did. The Company wants it. They'll use it to make _zuss_ fiber and sicces dust, and stuff like that. Maybe dream dust, too, an' so on. The point is you're gonna tell us how to make those gadgets. How about it?\"  Lon licked his lips. He said slowly, \"I think there's more. Go on.\"  \"You made another gadget,\" said the skipper, with relish, \"that turns out power without fuel. The Company wants that, too. Spacelines will pay for it. Cities will pay for it. It ought to be a pretty nice thing. You're gonna make plans and explanations of how that works and we're gonna make sure they're right. That clear?\"  \"Will you let us go when I've told you?\" Lon asked bitterly.  \"Not without one more gadget,\" the skipper added amiably. \"You made something that put a screen around the planet yonder, so it didn't get burned up. It'd oughta be useful. The company'll put one around Mercury. Convenient for minin' operations. One around that planet that's too close to Sirius. Oh, there's plenty of places that'll be useful. So you'll get set to draw up the plans for that, too--_and_ explanations of how it works. Then we'll talk about lettin' you go.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lon knew that he wouldn't be let go in any case. Not after he'd told them what was wanted. Not by men who'd work on a pleasure craft like this. Not with Cathy a prisoner with him. But he might as well get all the cards down.  \"And if I won't tell you what you want to know?\" he asked.  The skipper shrugged his shoulders. \"You were knocked out a while,\" he said without heat. \"While we were waitin' for you to come to, we told her--\" he jerked his thumb at Cathy--\"what would happen to her if you weren't obligin'. We told her plenty. She knows we mean it. We won't hurt you until we've finished with her. So you'd better get set to talk. I'll let her see if she can persuade you peaceable. I'll give her ten minutes.\"  He went out. The door clicked shut behind him and Lon knew that this was the finish. He looked at Cathy's dazed, horror-filled eyes. He knew this wasn't a bluff. He was up against the same system that had brought colonists to Cetis Gamma Two. The brains that had planned that system had planned this. They'd gotten completely qualified men to do their dirty work in both cases.  \"Lon, darling! Please kill me!\" Cathy said in a hoarse whisper.  He looked at her in astonishment.  \"Please kill me!\" repeated Cathy desperately. \"They--they can't ever dare let us go, Lon, after what they've told me! They've got to kill us both. But--Lon, darling--please kill me first....\"  An idea came into Lon's mind. He surveyed it worriedly. He knew that he would have to tell what he knew and then he would be killed. The Cetis Gamma Trading Company wanted his inventions, and it would need him dead after it had them.  The idea was hopeless, but he had to try it. They knew he'd made gadgets which did remarkable things. If he made something now and persuaded them that it was a weapon....  His flesh crawled with horror. Not for himself, but for Cathy. He fumbled in his pockets. A pocket knife. A key chain. String. His face was completely gray. He ripped an upholstered seat. There were coiled springs under the foamite. He pulled away a piece of decorative molding. He knew it wouldn't work, but there wasn't anything else to do. His hands moved awkwardly, with the handcuffs limiting their movements.  Time passed. He had something finished. It was a bit of wood with a coil spring from the chair, with his key chain wrapped around it and his pocket knife set in it so that the blade would seem to make a contact. But it would achieve nothing whatever.  Cathy stared at him. Her eyes were desperate, but she believed. She'd seen three equally improbable devices perform wonders. While Lon made something that looked like the nightmare of an ultimatist sculptor, she watched in terrified hope.         *       *       *       *       *  He had it in his hand when the door opened again and the skipper came back into the saloon. He said prosaically, \"Shall I call in the scientist guys to listen, or the persuader guys to work on her?\"  \"Neither. I've made another gadget,\" Lon said from a dry throat. \"It will kill you. It'll kill everybody on the ship--from here. You're going to put us back down on the planet below.\"  The skipper did not look at the gadget, but at Lon's face. Then he called. The four men of the crew and the two uneasy scientists came in.  \"We got to persuade,\" the skipper said sardonically. \"He just told me he's made a new gadget that'll kill us all.\"  He moved unhurriedly toward Lon. Lon knew that his bluff was no good. If the thing had actually been a weapon, he'd have been confident and assured. He didn't feel that way, but he raised the thing menacingly as the skipper approached.  The skipper took it away, laughing.  \"We'll tie him in a chair an' get to work on her. When he's ready to talk, we'll stop.\" He looked at the object in his hands. It was ridiculous to look at. It was as absurd as the device that extracted power from matter stresses, and the machine that converted one kind of vegetation into another, and the apparatus--partly barn roof--that had short-circuited the ionosphere of Cetis Gamma Two to the planet's solid surface. It looked very foolish indeed.  The skipper was amused.  \"Look out, you fellas,\" he said humorously. \"It's gonna kill you!\"  He crooked his finger and the knifeblade made a contact. He swept it in mock menace about the saloon. The four crew-members and the two scientists went stiff. He gaped at them, then turned the device to stare at it incredulously. He came within its range.  He stiffened. Off-balance, he fell on the device, breaking its gimcrack fastenings and the contact which transmitted nothing that Lon Simpson could imagine coming out of it. The others fell, one by one, with peculiarly solid impacts.  Their flesh was incredibly hard. It was as solid, in fact, as so much mahogany.         *       *       *       *       *  Nodalictha said warmly, \"You're a darling, Rhadampsicus! It was outrageous of those nasty creatures to intend to harm my pets! I'm glad you attended to them!\"  \"And I'm glad you're pleased, my dear,\" Rhadampsicus said pleasantly. \"Now shall we set out for home?\"  Nodalictha looked about the cosy landscape of the ninth planet of Cetis Gamma. There were jagged peaks of frozen air, and mountain ranges of water, solidified ten thousand aeons ago. There were frost-trees of nitrogen, the elaborate crystal formations of argon, and here a wide sweep of oxygen crystal sward, with tiny peeping wild crystals of deep-blue cyanogen seeming to grow more thickly by the brook of liquid hydrogen. And there was their bower; primitive, but the scene of a true honeymoon idyll.  \"I almost hate to go home, Rhadampsicus,\" Nodalictha said. \"We've been so happy here. Will you remember it for always?\"  \"Naturally,\" said Rhadampsicus. \"I'm glad you've been happy.\"  Nodalictha snuggled up to him and twined eye stalks with him.  \"Darling,\" she said softly, \"you've been wonderful, and I've been spoiled, and you've let me be. But I'm going to be a very dutiful wife from now on, Rhadampsicus. Only it has been fun, having you be so nice to me!\"  \"It's been fun for me, too,\" replied Rhadampsicus gallantly.  Nodalictha took a last glance around, and each of her sixteen eyes glowed sentimentally. Then she scanned the far-distant spaceship in the shadow of the second planet from the now subsiding sun.  \"My pets,\" she said tenderly. \"But--Rhadampsicus, what are they doing?\"  \"They've discovered that the crew of their vehicle--they call it a space yacht--aren't dead, that they're only in suspended animation. And they've decided in some uneasiness that they'd better take them back to Earth to be revived.\"  \"How nice! I knew they were sweet little creatures!\"  Rhadampsicus hesitated a moment.  \"From the male's mind I gather something else. Since the crew of this space yacht was"]]]
