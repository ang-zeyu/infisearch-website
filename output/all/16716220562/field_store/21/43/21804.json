He did not even complain of the treatment he had received, but thanked the Grand Gallipoot and hurried away upon his journey.  He had now secured the assistance of the Whimsies and the Growleywogs; but his success made him long for still more allies.  His own life depended upon his conquering Oz, and he said to himself:  \"I'll take no chances.  I'll be certain of success.  Then, when Oz is destroyed, perhaps I shall be a greater man than old Roquat, and I can throw him away and be King of the Nomes myself.  Why not?  The Whimsies are stronger than the Nomes, and they also are my friends.  There are some people still stronger than the Growleywogs, and if I can but induce them to aid me I shall have nothing more to fear.\"    9.  How the Wogglebug Taught Athletics  It did not take Dorothy long to establish herself in her new home, for she knew the people and the manners and customs of the Emerald City just as well as she knew the old Kansas farm.  But Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had some trouble in getting used to the finery and pomp and ceremony of Ozma's palace, and felt uneasy because they were obliged to be \"dressed up\" all the time.  Yet every one was very courteous and kind to them and endeavored to make them happy. Ozma, especially, made much of Dorothy's relatives, for her little friend's sake, and she well knew that the awkwardness and strangeness of their new mode of life would all wear off in time.  The old people were chiefly troubled by the fact that there was no work for them to do.  \"Ev'ry day is like Sunday, now,\" declared Aunt Em, solemnly, \"and I can't say I like it.  If they'd only let me do up the dishes after meals, or even sweep an' dust my own rooms, I'd be a deal happier. Henry don't know what to do with himself either, and once when he stole out an' fed the chickens Billina scolded him for letting 'em eat between meals.  I never knew before what a hardship it is to be rich and have everything you want.\"  These complaints began to worry Dorothy; so she had a long talk with Ozma upon the subject.  \"I see I must find them something to do,\" said the girlish Ruler of Oz, seriously.  \"I have been watching your uncle and aunt, and I believe they will be more contented if occupied with some light tasks.  While I am considering this matter, Dorothy, you might make a trip with them through the Land of Oz, visiting some of the odd corners and introducing your relatives to some of our curious people.\"  \"Oh, that would be fine!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly.  \"I will give you an escort befitting your rank as a Princess,\" continued Ozma; \"and you may go to some of the places you have not yet visited yourself, as well as some others that you know.  I will mark out a plan of the trip for you and have everything in readiness for you to start to-morrow morning.  Take your time, dear, and be gone as long as you wish.  By the time you return I shall have found some occupation for Uncle Henry and Aunt Em that will keep them from being restless and dissatisfied.\"  Dorothy thanked her good friend and kissed the lovely Ruler gratefully. Then she ran to tell the joyful news to her uncle and aunt.  Next morning, after breakfast, everything was found ready for their departure.  The escort included Omby Amby, the Captain General of Ozma's army, which consisted merely of twenty-seven officers besides the Captain General.  Once Omby Amby had been a private soldier--the only private in the army--but as there was never any fighting to do Ozma saw no need of a private, so she made Omby Amby the highest officer of them all. He was very tall and slim and wore a gay uniform and a fierce mustache. Yet the mustache was the only fierce thing about Omby Amby, whose nature was as gentle as that of a child.  The wonderful Wizard had asked to join the party, and with him came his friend the Shaggy Man, who was shaggy but not ragged, being dressed in fine silks with satin shags and bobtails.  The Shaggy Man had shaggy whiskers and hair, but a sweet disposition and a soft, pleasant voice.  There was an open wagon, with three seats for the passengers, and the wagon was drawn by the famous wooden Sawhorse which had once been brought to life by Ozma by means of a magic powder.  The Sawhorse wore wooden shoes to keep his wooden legs from wearing away, and he was strong and swift.  As this curious creature was Ozma's own favorite steed, and very popular with all the people of the Emerald City, Dorothy knew that she had been highly favored by being permitted to use the Sawhorse on her journey.  In the front seat of the wagon sat Dorothy and the Wizard.  Uncle Henry and Aunt Em sat in the next seat and the Shaggy Man and Omby Amby in the third seat.  Of course Toto was with the party, curled up at Dorothy's feet, and just as they were about to start, Billina came fluttering along the path and begged to be taken with them.  Dorothy readily agreed, so the Yellow Hen flew up and perched herself upon the dashboard.  She wore her pearl necklace and three bracelets upon each leg, in honor of the occasion.  Dorothy kissed Ozma good-bye, and all the people standing around waved their handkerchiefs, and the band in an upper balcony struck up a military march.  Then the Wizard clucked to the Sawhorse and said: \"Gid-dap!\" and the wooden animal pranced away and drew behind him the big red wagon and all the passengers, without any effort at all.  A servant threw open a gate of the palace enclosure, that they might pass out; and so, with music and shouts following them, the journey was begun.  \"It's almost like a circus,\" said Aunt Em, proudly.  \"I can't help feelin' high an' mighty in this kind of a turn-out.\"  Indeed, as they passed down the street, all the people cheered them lustily, and the Shaggy Man and the Wizard and the Captain General all took off their hats and bowed politely in acknowledgment.  When they came to the great wall of the Emerald City, the gates were opened by the Guardian who always tended them.  Over the gateway hung a dull-colored metal magnet shaped like a horse-shoe, placed against a shield of polished gold.  \"That,\" said the Shaggy Man, impressively, \"is the wonderful Love Magnet.  I brought it to the Emerald City myself, and all who pass beneath this gateway are both loving and beloved.\"  \"It's a fine thing,\" declared Aunt Em, admiringly.  \"If we'd had it in Kansas I guess the man who held a mortgage on the farm wouldn't have turned us out.\"  \"Then I'm glad we didn't have it,\" returned Uncle Henry.  \"I like Oz better than Kansas, even; an' this little wood Sawhorse beats all the critters I ever saw.  He don't have to be curried, or fed, or watered, an' he's strong as an ox.  Can he talk, Dorothy?\"  \"Yes, Uncle,\" replied the child.  \"But the Sawhorse never says much. He told me once that he can't talk and think at the same time, so he prefers to think.\"  \"Which is very sensible,\" declared the Wizard, nodding approvingly. \"Which way do we go, Dorothy?\"  \"Straight ahead into the Quadling Country,\" she answered.  \"I've got a letter of interduction to Miss Cuttenclip.\"  \"Oh!\" exclaimed the Wizard, much interested.  \"Are we going there? Then I'm glad I came, for I've always wanted to meet the Cuttenclips.\"  \"Who are they?\" inquired Aunt Em.  \"Wait till we get there,\" replied Dorothy, with a laugh; \"then you'll see for yourself.  I've never seen the Cuttenclips, you know, so I can't 'zactly 'splain 'em to you.\"  Once free of the Emerald City the Sawhorse dashed away at tremendous speed.  Indeed, he went so fast that Aunt Em had hard work to catch her breath, and Uncle Henry held fast to the seat of the red wagon.  \"Gently--gently, my boy!\" called the Wizard, and at this the Sawhorse slackened his speed.  \"What's wrong?\" asked the animal, slightly turning his wooden head to look at the party with one eye, which was a knot of wood.  \"Why, we wish to admire the scenery, that's all,\" answered the Wizard.  \"Some of your passengers,\" added the Shaggy Man, \"have never been out of the Emerald City before, and the country is all new to them.\"  \"If you go too fast you'll spoil all the fun,\" said Dorothy.  \"There's no hurry.\"  \"Very well; it is all the same to me,\" observed the Sawhorse; and after that he went at a more moderate pace.  Uncle Henry was astonished.  \"How can a wooden thing be so intelligent?\" he asked.  \"Why, I gave him some sawdust brains the last time I fitted his head with new ears,\" explained the Wizard.  \"The sawdust was made from hard knots, and now the Sawhorse is able to think out any knotty problem he meets with.\"  \"I see,\" said Uncle Henry.  \"I don't,\" remarked Aunt Em; but no one paid any attention to this statement.  Before long they came to a stately building that stood upon a green plain with handsome shade trees grouped here and there.  \"What is that?\" asked Uncle Henry.  \"That,\" replied the Wizard, \"is the Royal Athletic College of Oz, which is directed by Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E.\"  \"Let's stop and make a call,\" suggested Dorothy.  So the Sawhorse drew up in front of the great building and they were met at the door by the learned Wogglebug himself.  He seemed fully as tall as the Wizard, and was dressed in a red and white checked vest and a blue swallow-tailed coat, and had yellow knee breeches and purple silk stockings upon his slender legs.  A tall hat was jauntily set upon his head and he wore spectacles over his big bright eyes.  \"Welcome, Dorothy,\" said the Wogglebug; \"and welcome to all your friends.  We are indeed pleased to receive you at this great Temple of Learning.\"  \"I thought it was an Athletic College,\" said the Shaggy Man.  \"It is, my dear sir,\" answered the Wogglebug,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51700"],["title","Gift Card Designing (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Bookcover:                                 GIFT CARD                                DESIGNING                             by PEDRO J LEMOS                       THIS CHRISTMAS WREATH FOR YOU                               PUBLISHED BY                        THE SCHOOL ARTS MAGAZINE           The Davis Press, 25 Foster Street, Worcester, Mass.

LEMOS   There is less satisfactory holiday hunting for greeting cards than for any other gift. Visit any shop where gift cards are in evidence and you will note how prospective purchasers go over and over the display, finding one here, discarding it later and at the end possibly making a hesitating and unsatisfied selection.  Publishers have stated to me that if there is one symbol of the holiday season that should be rejuvenated, it is the custom of sending gift cards. We can all recall how dear to our eyes were the lace-edged, isinglass, snow-encrusted gift cards, which had to be handled with finger tips, and the singing bird sentiments, which were so daintily revealed by a surprise opening of a flap. These cards, together with the horse-hair sofa and the wax flowers in a glass dome, were part of a certain evolution, and, of course, the only place now for such cards is way down at the bottom of some memory box.  Previous to the world war, America was flooded with cards of a gingerbread tinsel order of decorations turned out by the million in foreign countries. These, as well as postcards, were printed in huge editions by sweat-shop methods, which, together with certain “can’t-be-done-better” slogans, caused our own shops to fall back as competitors.  Now we all know that, no matter how perfect the printing may be, the design and idea must be the selling factor of the gift card. And again, the more the idea and wording meet with the personal or local trend of the community in which it is distributed, the better it will be accepted.  That possibly is the reason why you and I can’t find what we want when we look for a card to express our personal feeling, because it was expressed either in Dresden or London or Hoboken or Squashville. What we need are cards that are typical community expressions from the parts of the country from which they come. It is just as foolish for me to send you a card from California with a home-coming sleigh scene having snow-burdened roofs for a back-ground, as it would be for you to send a decoration unrelated to your environment. Let’s use motifs and scenes and wording which create the charm of our home section, and we will find that the card will be doubly welcomed by the recipient on that account.  If the American card is to be encouraged in America, the designing and appreciation of such must be started right in the art rooms of our schools; and the most important part of such a problem is the lettering.  Lettering need not be approached with fear and trembling, for it can be done with ease and pleasure. I know of students who shunned lettering because they thought it mechanical and laborious, but who, after discovering its possibilities, had almost to be bribed to do anything else.  The old masters and artist-craftsmen recognized that lettering could be as artistic as the worker desired and nothing is more beautiful in lettering than the illuminated manuscripts and books of those ages.  The easiest way to produce lettering is to use the lettering pens. These pens are made with a separate, small brass tip which is placed on the pen as a fountain. The fountain is filled from the quill of the drawing ink bottle, just as the ink is put into a ruling pen. As the pens come in about twelve different stroke-widths, it is well to have a pen holder for each size. This will save confusion and time. When the pen is being used it should be held so that both sides of the pen-point rest on the paper. It is not necessary to press the pen for wide parts, as it will almost automatically produce the wide strokes when brought downward and the thin strokes when brought upward.  The board on which the drawing is made should be placed at an angle of 45 degrees to permit the ink to flow well. If too great a slant is used, the ink, strange to say, refuses to run up hill, and if the board is placed flat, the ink on the pen will be too ambitious to arrive.  Before beginning a card, the idea should be roughly planned, so that the general forms may be considered. This is termed the “dummy.” In planning the dummy, consider carefully the margins. Good lettering is often spoiled by poor spacing. Because you are doing lettering, do not ignore design principles. Every design principle you know of can be used in lettering, just as it can be in any art application.  To prevent your lettering from being at a slant, or “off its feet,” to use the printer’s term, you should rule light vertical plumb lines to guide your letter strokes.  When lettering, remember that unity must be thought of continually. If the finish of each stroke or “serif” is large on the first letter, it must be similar on all other letters. The thin strokes throughout a line of lettering should be equal in weight. This rule applies also to the thick strokes. The lettering pens take care of this if used properly and if no undue pressure is placed on the pen.  A beautiful initial is always a happy beginning to a quotation. With color or illumination added, much charm is possible. If the lettering is on soft-surfaced paper, it will be found that a leather tool or other metal point can be used for tooling the initial from the back as well as from the front. Gold or silver water colors, added with proper restraint give a sparkle to the card.  If your class wishes to raise funds for some worthy enterprise try having a class competition for gift cards. The verses can be a problem for the class in English. Selecting the best half-dozen designs, get in touch with an engraver, and have the students make working-drawings. Right there you will learn something new about drawing for the industries. Then after the engravings are received, if your school is one of the fortunate ones with a printing department, have your students co-operate with the printing students in securing the right colors, etc. Plan envelopes, which can be easily made by cutting the paper from patterns and then folding and pasting them together.  Beginners in gift card designing should all be encouraged to start with simple work, similar to that in Plate 3. Such work results in well-designed cards and is encouraging to the originator. The idea of using cut paper is always good with amateur artists, as it helps them to keep their work simple and makes color harmonies easier. Elaborate ideas, such as figures, ornate designs, etc., should be avoided at the start.  In selecting colors, the students should be encouraged to use subdued or grayed tones, for, by this means, they are much more certain of obtaining a rich-looking card. There are too many printed cards already on the market which are done in gaudy colors, without adding more. If cut paper cards are made, the students can decide on the colors they want by laying strips of the colored paper side by side, until the best color scheme has been decided upon.  Too much stress cannot be laid upon good placing or arrangement of the lettering. In Plate 4, we have a series of cards that are fairly good, but that would have been quite a bit improved by better lettering. The ideas and general arrangement of these cards make them good suggestions.  Often we find students in classes turning out cards all based upon the same general composition. It is easy for students to follow a general type of card suggested by the teacher or some progressive young artist. In Plate 5, we find a page of ten typical arrangements. Although different as to basic composition, they are all good, and can be used as a start for original work. Always bear in mind the idea that both lettering and decoration should be in complete harmony. Light fantastic lettering, for instance, would not be in harmony with heavy, bold decorations.  In late years we find many artists and designers, who cannot find suitable cards in the book shops, sketching designs of their own and having them printed. In this way they can put in an individual touch and produce a card that exactly meets their requirements. Although such a card is more expensive than a stock card, the plan works out well for those who have a fair list of mailing acquaintances. A page of such cards is shown in Plate 6.  The use of flat, massive tones, provided the colors are not too heavy, always makes a distinctive card. Plate 7 shows a page of such designs. A good typical example is the card in the lower right hand corner which contains the quotation from Dickens. The use of toned paper often helps. At most art stores it is possible to obtain a vegetable parchment paper which makes splendid material on which to draw or print the strong, decorative type of gift card.  Oftentimes we receive or send holiday cards that are based on a humorous trend. Nothing takes so well as a bit of verse with a smile tied onto it somewhere, provided it is well done. A cheerful card is generally kept and placed where its owner can see it often. Designs for such cards should be well-planned, in order to avoid an appearance of the comic valentine in their general make-up. A page of work having the semi-humorous element is found in Plate 8.  Anyone desiring to reproduce an artistic card with the minimum expense, will do well to look into the idea of using cut linoleum. By planning motifs that hold well together, and are strong in design, it is possible to cut out some very acceptable blocks in heavy linoleum. From these, almost any number of gift cards can be printed by hand in varied colors. When dry, these cards can be hand colored."]]]
