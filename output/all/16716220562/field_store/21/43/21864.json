He hoped that he hadn't seen what he thought he had seen _sober_.  He woke up and wondered what was wrong. Little tinkling ice spiders were moving around him. He could hear their tiny crystal sounds and feel their chill legs, so lightly, on him. It was still a dream--wasn't it?  Or was he awake? The thing was, he couldn't tell. If he was awake, it was the middle of the night, because there was no light whatever; and besides, he didn't seem to be able to move.  Thought Mooney with anger and desperation: I'm dead. And: What a time to die!  But second thoughts changed his mind; there was no heaven and no hell, in all the theologies he had investigated, that included being walked over by tiny spiders of ice. He _felt_ them. There was no doubt about it.  It was Harse, of course--had to be. Whatever he was up to, Mooney couldn't say, but as he lay there sweating cold sweat and feeling the crawling little feet, he knew that it was something Harse had made happen.  Little by little, he began to be able to see--not much, but enough to see that there really was something crawling. Whatever the things were, they had a faint, tenuous glow, like the face of a watch just before dawn. He couldn't make out shapes, but he could tell the size--not much bigger than a man's hand--and he could tell the number, and there were dozens of them.  He couldn't turn his head, but on the walls, on his chest, on his face, even on the ceiling, he could see faint moving patches of fox-fire light.         *       *       *       *       *  He took a deep breath. \"Harse!\" he started to call; wake him up, make him stop this! But he couldn't. He got no further than the first huff of the aspirate when the scurrying cold feet were on his lips. Something cold and damp lay across them and it stuck. Like spider silk, but stronger--he couldn't speak, couldn't move his lips, though he almost tore the flesh.  Oh, he could make a noise, all right. He started to do so, to snort and hum through his nose. But Mooney was not slow of thought and he had a sudden clear picture of that same cold ribbon crossing his nostrils, and what would be the use of all of time's treasures then, when it was no longer possible to breathe at all?  It was quite apparent that he was not to make a noise.  He had patience--the kind of patience that grows with a diet of thrice-used tea bags and soggy crackers. He waited.  It wasn't the middle of the night after all, he perceived, though it was still utterly dark except for the moving blobs. He could hear sounds in the hotel corridor outside--faintly, though: the sound of a vacuum cleaner, and it might have been a city block away; the tiniest whisper of someone laughing.  He remembered one of his drunken fantasies of the night before--little robot mice, or so they seemed, spinning a curtain across the window; and he shuddered, because that had been no fantasy. The window was curtained. And it was mid-morning, at the earliest, because the chambermaids were cleaning the halls.  Why couldn't he move? He flexed the muscles of his arms and legs, but nothing happened. He could feel the muscles straining, he could feel his toes and fingers twitch, but he was restrained by what seemed a web of Gulliver's cords....  There was a tap at the door. A pause, the scratching of a key, and the room was flooded with light from the hall.  Out of the straining corner of his eye, Mooney saw a woman in a gray cotton uniform, carrying fresh sheets, standing in the doorway, and her mouth was hanging slack. No wonder, for in the light from the hall, Mooney could see the room festooned with silver, with darting silvery shapes moving about. Mooney himself wore a cocoon of silver, and on the bed next to him, where Harse slept, there was a fantastic silver hood, like the basketwork of a baby's bassinet, surrounding his head.  It was a fairyland scene and it lasted only a second. For Harse cried out and leaped to his feet. Quick as an adder, he scooped up something from the table beside his bed and gestured with it at the door. It was, Mooney half perceived, the silvery, jointed thing he had used in the truck; and he used it again.  Pale blue light streamed out.  It faded and the chambermaid, popping eyes and all, was gone.         *       *       *       *       *  It didn't hurt as much the second time.  Mooney finally attracted Harse's attention, and Harse, with a Masonic pass over one of the little silvery things, set it to loosening and removing the silver bonds. The things were like toy tanks with jointed legs; as they spun the silver webs, they could also suck them in. In moments, the webs that held Mooney down were gone.  He got up, aching in his tired muscles and his head, but this time the panic that had filled him in the truck was gone. Well, one victim more or less--what did it matter? And besides, he clung to the fact that Harse had not exactly said the victims were dead.  So it didn't hurt as much the second time.  Mooney planned. He shut the door and sat on the edge of the bed. \"Shut up--you put us in a lousy fix and I have to think a way out of it,\" he rasped at Harse when Harse started to speak; and the man from the future looked at him with opaque pale eyes, and silently opened one of the flat canisters and began to eat.  \"All right,\" said Mooney at last. \"Harse, get rid of all this stuff.\"  \"This. Stuff?\"  \"The stuff on the walls. What your little spiders have been spinning, understand? Can't you get it off the walls?\"  Harse leaned forward and touched the kit. The little spider-things that had been aimlessly roving now began to digest what they had created, as the ones that had held Mooney had already done. It was quick--Mooney hoped it would be quick enough. There were over a dozen of the things, more than Mooney would have believed the little kit could hold; and he had seen no sign of them before.  The silvery silk on the walls, in aimless tracing, disappeared. The thick silvery coat over the window disappeared. Harse's bassinet-hood disappeared. A construction that haloed the door disappeared--and as it dwindled, the noises from the corridor grew louder; some sort of sound-absorbing contrivance, Mooney thought, wondering.  There was an elaborate silvery erector-set affair on the floor between the beds; it whirled and spun silently and the little machines took it apart again and swallowed it. Mooney had no notion of its purpose. When it was gone, he could see no change, but Harse shuddered and shifted his position uncomfortably.  \"All right,\" said Mooney when everything was back in the kit. \"Now you just keep your mouth shut. I won't ask you to lie--they'll have enough trouble understanding you if you tell the truth. Hear me?\"  Harse merely stared, but that was good enough. Mooney put his hand on the phone. He took a deep breath and held it until his head began to tingle and his face turned red. Then he picked up the phone and, when he spoke, there was authentic rage and distress in his voice.  \"Operator,\" he snarled, \"give me the manager. And hurry up--I want to report a thief!\"         *       *       *       *       *  When the manager had gone--along with the assistant manager, the house detective and the ancient shrew-faced head housekeeper--Mooney extracted a promise from Harse and left him. He carefully hung a \"Do Not Disturb\" card from the doorknob, crossed his fingers and took the elevator downstairs.  The fact seemed to be that Harse didn't care about _aboriginals_. Mooney had arranged a system of taps on the door which, he thought, Harse would abide by, so that Mooney could get back in. Just the same, Mooney vowed to be extremely careful about how he opened that door. Whatever the pale blue light was, Mooney wanted no part of it directed at him.  The elevator operator greeted him respectfully--a part of the management's policy of making amends, no doubt. Mooney returned the greeting with a barely civil nod. Sure, it had worked; he'd told the manager that he'd caught the chambermaid trying to steal something valuable that belonged to that celebrated proprietor of valuable secrets, Mr. Harse; the chambermaid had fled; how dared they employ a person like that?  And he had made very sure that the manager and the house dick and all the rest had plenty of opportunity to snoop apologetically in every closet and under the beds, just so there would be no suspicion in their minds that a dismembered chambermaid-torso was littering some dark corner of the room. What could they do but accept the story? The chambermaid wasn't there to defend herself, and though they might wonder how she had got out of the hotel without being noticed, it was their problem to figure it out, not Mooney's to explain it.  They had even been grateful when Mooney offered handsomely to refrain from notifying the police.  \"Lobby, sir,\" sang out the elevator operator, and Mooney stepped out, nodded to the manager, stared down the house detective and walked out into the street.  So far, so good.  Now that the animal necessities of clothes and food and a place to live were taken care of, Mooney had a chance to operate. It was a field in which he had always had a good deal of talent--the making of deals, the locating of contacts, the arranging of transactions that were better conducted in private.  And he had a good deal of business to transact. Harse had accepted without question his statement that they would have to raise more money.  \"Try heroin or Platinum?\" he had suggested, and gone back to his viewer.  \"I will,\" Mooney assured him, and he did; he tried them both, and more besides.         *       *       *       *       *  Not only was it good that he had such valuable commodities to vend, but it was a useful item in his total of knowledge concerning Harse that the man from the future seemed to have no idea of the value of money in the 20th Century, _chez_ U.S.A.  Mooney found a buyer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51809"],["title","Survival Kit (#4)"],["body","the drugs; and there was a few thousand dollars there, which helped, for although the quantity was not large, the drugs were chemically pure. He found a fence to handle the jewels and precious metals; and he unloaded all the ones of moderate value--not the other diamond, not the rubies, not the star sapphire.  He arranged to keep those without mentioning it to Harse. No point in selling them now, not when they had several thousand dollars above any conceivable expenses, not when some future date would do as well, just in case Harse should get away with the balance of the kit.  Having concluded his business, Mooney undertook a brief but expensive shopping tour of his own and found a reasonably satisfactory place to eat. After a pleasantly stimulating cocktail and the best meal he had had in some years--doubly good, for there was no reek from Harse's nauseating concoctions to spoil it--he called for coffee, for brandy, for the day's papers.  The disappearance of the truck driver made hardly a ripple. There were a couple of stories, but small and far in the back--amnesia, said one; an underworld kidnaping, suggested another; but the story had nothing to feed on and it would die.  Good enough, thought Mooney, waving for another glass of that enjoyable brandy; and then he turned back to the front page and saw his own face.  There was the hotel lobby of the previous day, and a pillar of churning black smoke that Mooney knew was Harse, and there in the background, mouth agape, expression worried, was Howard Mooney himself.  He read it all very, very carefully.  Well, he thought, at least they didn't get our names. The story was all about the Loyal and Beneficent Order of Exalted Eagles, and the only reference to the picture was a brief line about a disturbance outside the meeting hall. Nonetheless, the second glass of brandy tasted nowhere near as good as the first.         *       *       *       *       *  Time passed. Mooney found a man who explained what was meant by the Vale of Cashmere. In Brooklyn, there is a very large park--the name is Prospect Park--and in it is a little planted valley, with a brook and a pool; and the name of it on the maps of Prospect Park is the Vale of Cashmere. Mooney sent out for a map, memorized it; and that was that.  However, Mooney didn't really want to go to the Vale of Cashmere with Harse. What he wanted was that survival kit. Wonders kept popping out of it, and each day's supply made Mooney covet the huger store that was still inside. There had been, he guessed, something like a hundred separate items that had somehow come out of that tiny box. There simply was no room for them all; but that was not a matter that Mooney concerned himself with. They were there, possible or not, because he had seen them.  Mooney laid traps.  The trouble was that Harse did not care for conversation. He spent endless hours with his film viewer, and when he said anything at all to Mooney, it was to complain. All he wanted was to exist for four days--nothing else.  Mooney laid conversational traps, tried to draw him out, and there was no luck. Harse would turn his blank, pale stare on him, and refuse to be drawn.  At night, however hard Mooney tried, Harse was always awake past him; and in his sleep, always and always, the little metal guardians strapped Mooney tight. Survival kit? But how did the little metal things know that Mooney was a threat?  It was maddening and time was passing. There were four days, then only three, then only two. Mooney made arrangements of his own.  He found two girls--lovely girls, the best that money could buy, and he brought them to the suite with a wink and a snigger. \"A little relaxation, eh, Harse? The red-haired one is named Ginger and she's partial to men with light-colored eyes.\"  Ginger smiled a rehearsed and lovely smile. \"I certainly _am_, Mr. Harse. Say, want to dance?\"  But it came to nothing, though the house detective knocked deferentially on the door to ask if they could be a little more quiet, please. It wasn't the sound of celebration that the neighbors were objecting to. It was the shrill, violent noise of Harse's laughter. First he had seemed not to understand, and then he looked as astonished as Mooney had ever seen him. And then the laughter.  Girls didn't work. Mooney got rid of the girls.  All right, Mooney was a man of infinite resource and sagacity--hadn't he proved that many a time? He excused himself to Harse, made sure his fat new pigskin wallet was in his pocket, and took a cab to a place on Brooklyn's waterfront where cabs seldom go. The bartender had arms like beer kegs and a blue chin.  \"Beer,\" said Mooney, and made sure he paid for it with a twenty-dollar bill--thumbing through a thick wad of fifties and hundreds to find the smallest. He retired to a booth and nursed his beer.  After about ten minutes, a man stood beside him, blue-chinned and muscular enough to be the bartender's brother--which, Mooney found, he was.  \"Well,\" said Mooney, \"it took you long enough. Sit down. You don't have to roll me; you can earn this.\"  Girls didn't work? Okay, if not girls, then try boys ... well, not boys exactly. Hoodlums. Try hoodlums and see what Harse might do against the toughest inhabitants of the area around the Gowanus Canal.         *       *       *       *       *  Harse, sloshing heedlessly through melted snow, spattering Mooney, grumbled: \"I do not see why we. Must? Wander endlessly across the face of this wretched slum.\"  Mooney said soothingly: \"We have to make _sure_, Harse. We have to be sure it's the right place.\"  \"Huff,\" said Harse, but he went along. They were in Prospect Park and it was nearly dark.  \"Hey, look,\" said Mooney desperately, \"look at those kids on sleds!\"  Harse glanced angrily at the kids on sleds and even more angrily at Mooney. Still, he wasn't refusing to come and that was something. It had been possible that Harse would sit tight in the hotel room and it had taken all of the persuasive powers Mooney prided himself on to get him out. But Mooney was able to paint a horrible picture of getting to the wrong place, missing the Nexus Point, seventeen long years of waiting for the next one.  They crossed the Sheep Meadow, crossed the walk, crossed an old covered bridge; and they were at the head of a flight of shallow steps.  \"The Vale of Cashmere!\" cried Mooney, as though he were announcing a miracle.  Harse said nothing.  Mooney licked his lips, glancing at the kit Harse carried under an arm, glancing around. No one was in sight.  Mooney coughed. \"Uh. You're sure this is the place you mean?\"  \"If it is the Vale of Cashmere.\" Harse looked once more down the steps, then turned.  \"No, wait!\" said Mooney frantically. \"I mean--well, _where_ in the Vale of Cashmere is the Nexus Point? This is a big place!\"  Harse's pale eyes stared at him for a moment. \"No. Not big.\"  \"Oh, _fairly_ big. After all--\"  Harse said positively: \"Come.\"  Mooney swore under his breath and vowed never to trust anyone again, especially a bartender's brother; but just then it happened. Out of the snowy bushes stepped a man in a red bandanna, holding a gun. \"This is a stickup! Gimme that bag!\"  Mooney exulted.  There was no chance for Harse now. The man was leaping toward him; there would be no time for him to open the bag, take out the weapon....  But he didn't have to. There was a thin, singing, whining sound from the bag. It leaped out of Harse's hand, leaped free as though it had invisible wings, and flew at the man in the red bandanna. The man stumbled and jumped aside, the eyes incredulous over the mask. The silvery flat metal kit spun round him, whining. It circled him once, spiraled up. Behind it, like a smoke trail from a destroyer, a pale blue mist streamed backward. It surrounded the man and hid him.  The bag flew back into Harse's hand.  The violet mist thinned and disappeared.  And the man was gone, as utterly and as finally as any chambermaid or driver of a truck.  There was a moment of silence. Mooney stared without belief at the snow sifting down from the bushes that the man had hid in.  Harse looked opaquely at Mooney. \"It seems,\" he said, \"that in these slums are many. Dangers?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mooney was very quiet on the way back to the hotel. Harse, for once, was not gazing into his viewer. He sat erect and silent beside Mooney, glancing at him from time to time. Mooney did not relish the attention.  The situation had deteriorated.  It deteriorated even more when they entered the lobby of the hotel. The desk clerk called to Mooney.  Mooney hesitated, then said to Harse: \"You go ahead. I'll be up in a minute. And listen--don't forget about my knock.\"  Harse inclined his head and strode into the elevator. Mooney sighed.  \"There's a gentleman to see you, Mr. Mooney,\" the desk clerk said civilly.  Mooney swallowed. \"A--a gentleman? To see me?\"  The clerk nodded toward the writing room. \"In there, sir. A gentleman who says he knows you.\"  Mooney pursed his lips.  In the writing room? Well, that was an advantage. The writing room was off the main lobby; it would give Mooney a chance to peek in before whoever it was could see him. He approached the entrance cautiously....  \"Howard!\" cried an accusing familiar voice behind him.  Mooney turned. A small man with curly red hair was coming out of a door, marked \"Men.\"  \"Why--why, Uncle Lester!\" said Mooney. \"What a p-pleasant surprise!\"  Lester, all of five feet tall, wispy red hair surrounding his red plump face, looked up at him belligerently.  \"No doubt!\" he snapped. \"I've been waiting all day, Howard. Took the afternoon off from work to come here. And I wouldn't have been here at all if I hadn't seen _this_.\"  He was holding a copy of the paper with Mooney's picture, behind the pillar of black fog. \"Your aunt wrapped my lunch in it, Howard. Otherwise I might have missed it. Went right to the hotel. You weren't there. The doorman helped, though. Found a cab"]]]
