I guess I recognized a kindred spirit or I would have tossed him out on his ear without another word. Instead I played along. \"If you're from such a distant place, how come you speak English so well?\"  \"I'm not speaking. I'm a telepath--not the kind that reads minds, just the kind that projects. I communicate in symbols that you translate back to colloquial speech.\"  \"Very clever, Mr. Gorb.\" I grinned at him and shook my head. \"You spin a good yarn--but for my money, you're really Sam Jones or Phil Smith from Earth, stranded here and out of cash. You want a free trip back to Earth. No deal. The demand for beings from Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low these days. Zero, in fact. Good-by, Mr. Gorb.\"  He pointed a finger squarely at me and said, \"You're making a big mistake. I'm just what your outfit needs. A representative of a hitherto utterly unknown race identical to humanity in every respect! Look here, examine my teeth. Absolutely like human teeth! And--\"  I pulled away from his yawning mouth. \"Good-by, Mr. Gorb,\" I repeated.  \"All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. It isn't much. I'll be a big attraction. I'll--\"  \"_Good-by, Mr. Gorb!_\"  He glowered at me reproachfully for a moment, stood up and sauntered to the door. \"I thought you were a man of acumen, Corrigan. Well, think it over. Maybe you'll regret your hastiness. I'll be back to give you another chance.\"  He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile. This was the best con switch yet--an Earthman posing as an alien to get a job!  But I wasn't buying it, even if I could appreciate his cleverness intellectually. There's no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there's only one human race in the Galaxy--on Earth. I was going to need some real good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free ticket home.  I didn't know it then, but before the day was out, I would have that reason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.         *       *       *       *       *  The first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a Kallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I had turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan, and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds. Hardly had the 'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the Kallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him officially.  He was big even for his kind--in the neighborhood of nine feet high, and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his three stocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture, and growled, \"I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign me immediately to a contract.\"  \"Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.\"  \"You will grant me a contract!\"  \"Will you please sit down?\"  He said sulkily, \"I will remain standing.\"  \"As you prefer.\" My desk has a few concealed features which are sometimes useful in dealing with belligerent or disappointed life-forms. My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case of trouble.  The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They're hairy creatures, and this one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering his body. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanket of fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of his warlike race.  I said, \"You'll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it's not our policy to maintain more than a few members of each species at our Institute. And we're not currently in need of any Kallerian males, because--\"  \"You will hire me or trouble I will make!\"  I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were already carrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty.  The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. \"Yes, you have four representatives--of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn! For three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult to the noble Clan Gursdrinn!\"  At the key-word _avenge_, I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerian in a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but he didn't move. He bellowed, \"I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me to Earth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I'm a man of principles, like all straightforward double-dealers, and one of the most important of those principles is that I never let myself be bullied by anyone. \"I deeply regret having unintentionally insulted your clan, Freeman Heraal. Will you accept my apologies?\"  He glared at me in silence.  I went on, \"Please be assured that I'll undo the insult at the earliest possible opportunity. It's not feasible for us to hire another Kallerian now, but I'll give preference to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon as a vacancy--\"  \"No. You will hire me now.\"  \"It can't be done, Freeman Heraal. We have a budget, and we stick to it.\"  \"You will rue! I will take drastic measures!\"  \"Threats will get you nowhere, Freeman Heraal. I give you my word I'll get in touch with you as soon as our organization has room for another Kallerian. And now, please, there are many applicants waiting--\"  You'd think it would be sort of humiliating to become a specimen in a zoo, but most of these races take it as an honor. And there's always the chance that, by picking a given member of a race, we're insulting all the others.  I nudged the trouble-button on the side of my desk and Auchinleck and Ludlow appeared simultaneously from the two doors at right and left. They surrounded the towering Kallerian and sweet-talkingly led him away. He wasn't minded to quarrel physically, or he could have knocked them both into the next city with a backhand swipe of his shaggy paw, but he kept up a growling flow of invective and threats until he was out in the hall.  I mopped sweat from my forehead and began to buzz Stebbins for the next applicant. But before my finger touched the button, the door popped open and a small being came scooting in, followed by an angry Stebbins.  \"Come here, you!\"  \"Stebbins?\" I said gently.  \"I'm sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost sight of this one for a moment, and he came running in--\"  \"Please, please,\" squeaked the little alien pitifully. \"I must see you, honored sir!\"  \"It isn't his turn in line,\" Stebbins protested. \"There are at least fifty ahead of him.\"  \"All right,\" I said tiredly. \"As long as he's in here already, I might as well see him. Be more careful next time, Stebbins.\"  Stebbins nodded dolefully and backed out.         *       *       *       *       *  The alien was a pathetic sight: a Stortulian, a squirrely-looking creature about three feet high. His fur, which should have been a lustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. His tail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even at full volume.  \"Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am a being of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travel to Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview with yourself.\"  I said, \"I'd better tell you right at the outset that we're already carrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and a female now and--\"  \"This is known to me. The female--is her name perchance Tiress?\"  I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulian entry. \"Yes, that's her name.\"  The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. \"It is she! It is she!\"  \"I'm afraid we don't have room for any more--\"  \"You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress, she is--was--my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my life and my love.\"  \"Funny,\" I said. \"When we signed her three years ago, she said she was single. It's right here on the chart.\"  \"She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendors of Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry, languishing in sadness and pining for her return. You _must_ take me to Earth!\"  \"But--\"  \"I must see her--her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I must reason with her. Earthman, can't you see I must appeal to her inner flame? _I must bring her back!_\"  My face was expressionless. \"You don't really intend to join our organization at all--you just want free passage to Earth?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" wailed the Stortulian. \"Find some other member of my race, if you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a dead lump of stone?\"         *       *       *       *       *  It isn't, but another of my principles is to refuse to be swayed by sentiment. I felt sorry for this being's domestic troubles, but I wasn't going to break up a good act just to make an alien squirrel happy--not to mention footing the transportation.  I said, \"I don't see how we can manage it. The laws are very strict on the subject of bringing alien life to Earth. It has to be for scientific purposes only. And if I know in advance that your purpose in coming isn't scientific, I can't in all conscience _lie_ for you, can I?\"  \"Well--\"  \"Of course not.\" I took advantage of his pathetic upset to steam right along. \"Now if you had come in here and simply asked me to sign you up, I might conceivably have done it. But no--you had to go unburden your heart to me.\"  \"I thought the truth would move you.\"  \"It did. But in effect you're now asking me to conspire in a fraudulent criminal act. Friend, I can't do it. My reputation means too much to me,\" I said piously.  \"Then you will refuse me?\"  \"My heart melts to nothingness for you. But I can't take you to Earth.\"  \"Perhaps you will send my wife to me here?\"  There's a clause in every contract that allows me to jettison an unwanted specimen. All I have to do is declare it no longer of scientific interest, and the World Government will deport the undesirable alien back to its home world. But I wouldn't pull a low trick like that on our female"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51361"],["title","Birds of a Feather (#2)"],["body","rtulian.  I said, \"I'll ask her about coming home. But I won't ship her back against her will. And maybe she's happier where she is.\"  The Stortulian seemed to shrivel. His eyelids closed half-way to mask his tears. He turned and shambled slowly to the door, walking like a living dishrag. In a bleak voice, he said, \"There is no hope then. All is lost. I will never see my soulmate again. Good day, Earthman.\"  He spoke in a drab monotone that almost, but not quite, had me weeping. I watched him shuffle out. I do have _some_ conscience, and I had the uneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to commit suicide on my account.         *       *       *       *       *  About fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then life started to get complicated again.  Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reason or another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the day so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.  I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian's outraged pride and the Stortulian's flighty wife when the door opened and the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII stepped in.  \"How did _you_ get in here?\" I demanded.  \"Your man happened to be looking the wrong way,\" he said cheerily. \"Change your mind about me yet?\"  \"Get out before I have you thrown out.\"  Gorb shrugged. \"I figured you hadn't changed your mind, so I've changed my pitch a bit. If you won't believe I'm from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose I tell you that I _am_ Earthborn, and that I'm looking for a job on your staff.\"  \"I don't care _what_ your story is! Get out or--\"  \"--you'll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second. Corrigan, you're no fool, and neither am I--but that fellow of yours outside _is_. He doesn't know how to handle alien beings. How many times today has a life-form come in here unexpectedly?\"  I scowled at him. \"Too damn many.\"  \"You see? He's incompetent. Suppose you fire him, take me on instead. I've been living in the outworlds half my life; I know all there is to know about alien life-forms. You can use me, Corrigan.\"  I took a deep breath and glanced all around the paneled ceiling of the office before I spoke. \"Listen, Gorb, or whatever your name is, I've had a hard day. There's been a Kallerian in here who just about threatened murder, and there's been a Stortulian in here who's about to commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it's troubling me. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up and go home to Earth. I don't want you hanging around here bothering me. I'm not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back to claiming you're an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer is that I'm not looking for any of _those_ either. Now will you scram or--\"  The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian, came thundering in. He was dressed from head to toe in glittering metalfoil, and instead of his ceremonial blaster, he was wielding a sword the length of a human being. Stebbins and Auchinleck came dragging helplessly along in his wake, hanging desperately to his belt.  \"Sorry, Chief,\" Stebbins gasped. \"I tried to keep him out, but--\"  Heraal, who had planted himself in front of my desk, drowned him out with a roar. \"Earthman, you have mortally insulted the Clan Gursdrinn!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to let him have it at the first sight of actual violence.  Heraal boomed, \"You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have notified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the death of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!\"  \"Watch it, Chief,\" Stebbins yelled. \"He's going to--\"  An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun trigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it savagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the sword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of bluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.  Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door flew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the green sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down at the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.  \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked.  \"Y-yes.\"  \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint being--\"  \"--that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the untimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of the Ghrynian policemen.  \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver of the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several minutes ago.\"  \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest you for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than $100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\"  \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the Universe can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and _I'm_ responsible?\"  \"This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to this late life-form's request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"  \"Well, no, but--\"  \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Closing my eyes wearily, I tried to wish the whole babbling lot of them away. If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was going to put an awful dent in this year's take. And I shuddered when I remembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to come bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000 per suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.  I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced arrival.  The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway and stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian policemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a moment and turned to eye the newcomer.  I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I resolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again--or, if I _did_ come, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against crackpots.  In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, \"Life is no longer worth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me to do.\"  I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers going down the drain. \"Stop him, somebody! He's going to kill himself! He's--\"  Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me flying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the meshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I guess I wasn't fully aware of what was going on.  Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole in the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I saw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The man who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting himself off.  He helped me up. \"Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that Stortulian wasn't here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get you.\"  I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying fragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed plaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the struggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.  \"Evidently you don't know as much as you think you do about Stortulian psychology, Corrigan,\" Gorb said lightly. \"Suicide is completely abhorrent to them. When they're troubled, they kill the person who caused their trouble. In this case, you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I began to chuckle--more of a tension-relieving snicker than a full-bodied laugh.  \"Funny,\" I said.  \"What is?\" asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.  \"These aliens. Big blustery Heraal came in with murder in his eye and killed _himself_, and the pint-sized Stortulian who looked so meek and pathetic damn near blew my head off.\" I shuddered. \"Thanks for the tackle job.\"  \"Don't mention it,\" Gorb said.  I glared at the Ghrynian police. \"Well? What are you waiting for? Take that murderous little beast out of here! Or isn't murder against the local laws?\"  \"The Stortulian will be duly punished,\" replied the leader of the Ghrynian cops calmly. \"But there is the matter of the dead Kallerian and the fine of--\"  \"--one hundred thousand dollars. I know.\" I groaned and turned to Stebbins. \"Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have them send down a legal adviser. Find out if there's any way we can get out of this mess with our skins intact.\"  \"Right, Chief.\" Stebbins moved toward the visiphone.  Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest.  \"Hold it,\" the Wazzenazzian said crisply. \"The Consulate can't help you. I can.\"  \"You?\" I said.  \"I can get you out of this cheap.\"  \"_How_ cheap?\"  Gorb grinned rakishly. \"Five thousand in cash plus a contract as a specimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That's a heck of a lot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn't it?\"  I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn't be much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless they were really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officials ever worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand, giving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition.  \"Tell you what,\" I said finally. \"You've got yourself a deal--but on a contingency basis. Get me out of this and you'll have five grand and the contract. Otherwise, nothing.\"  Gorb shrugged. \"What have I to lose?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Before the police"]]]
