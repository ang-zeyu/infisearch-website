LEHI AND HIS SONS.  THE SONS RETURN TO JERUSALEM.  While Lehi's family were living in their tents in the wilderness by the shore of the Red Sea the Lord told Lehi in a dream to send his sons back to Jerusalem.  There was a man in Jerusalem who had some plates of brass on which was written or engraved the record or history of Lehi's relatives, his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and others. They gave an account of the Jews from the time they came to Jerusalem and for a long time before they came there. The record on the plates also told about the creation of the world, about Adam and Eve, our first parents, about Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and many other people.  Lehi wanted these plates to take with him, that his family and those who lived with them might have an account of their forefathers, and the laws of the Lord which were given through Moses, which were also contained on these brass plates.  At the time when Lehi lived the people did not have books made of paper, like those we have. Instead of paper to write on they used skins of animals and other materials. Sometimes they used brass or gold plates, and cut the writing into the plates with a sharp knife or other tool.  Lehi sent his four sons back to Jerusalem to get these plates from Laban, the man who was taking care of them.  When Laman and Lemuel were told that they must go they again complained and found fault with their father; but when Nephi was spoken to about going he was very willing to do so and did not complain. Laman and Lemuel thought it was very hard for them to go back on such an errand, but Nephi said he knew the Lord would not want them to do anything they were not able to; and he believed the Lord would watch over them while on their journey. How much better it would have been for them all to be obedient like Nephi was will be seen from the following stories. So Nephi and his other brothers took their tents and started on their journey.  When they reached the city of Jerusalem they decided among themselves that Laman, the older one of the four, should go to Laban's house and ask for the plates. It was right that their father should have the plates, or the Lord would not have told him to send for them. But when Laman asked Laban to give the plates to him he became angry. He called Laman a robber, and said he would kill him. Laman then ran away, so the man did not catch him.  When Laman went back to where his brothers were waiting for him and told what had happened they all felt very sorry. The older brothers wanted to go back to their father; but Nephi was determined to get the plates for which he had been sent. He persuaded his brothers to stay with him, and they went to their father's old home and gathered up the gold and silver and other precious things which had been left there. These things they took to Laban and offered them to him if he would give them the brass plates that contained the writings or records.  When Laban saw they had so much gold and silver and other valuable things he wanted to get the things, but would not give up the plates. So he put Lehi's sons out of his house, then he sent his servants after them to slay them and take their property. When these servants of Laban came after Nephi and his brothers they had to leave their gold and silver and run for their lives. They got out of the city and hid in a cave or hole in a rock, and so the men who were after them could not find them.  After this Laman and Lemuel became angry with Nephi and Sam, and they whipped them with a rod. Then an angel from heaven appeared and told them to not harm their younger brother Nephi, but to go again to Laban and the Lord would help them in performing their errand. When the angel left them Laman and Lemuel again complained, and said they did not believe they could perform their errand. Nephi reasoned with them and persuaded them to go with him towards the city, although they were still dissatisfied and angry.  When they got to the gate of Jerusalem it was night. Nephi told his brothers to hide there while he crept into the city.  He went towards the house where Laban lived and on his way near the house he saw a man lying on the ground. The man was drunk. He looked at him and found it was Laban. Laban had a sword with him, which Nephi drew from its sheath. He examined it, and saw it was made of fine steel, with a beautiful handle made of pure gold.  While Laban lay before him on the ground the Spirit of the Lord told Nephi to kill him. Nephi did not like to do this. He was a good young man, and knew it was not right to kill. But the Lord commanded him to kill Laban, and he obeyed the Lord. Nephi then put Laban's clothes on himself and went into Laban's house. Here he found the servant who took care of Laban's treasures. Nephi told this man to go and get the plates of brass from the place where they were kept and follow him. The servant, whose name was Zoram, thought it was Laban who was talking to him. He therefore brought out the plates that contained the records and went with Nephi to where his brothers were outside the gates of the city.  [Image captioned \"NEPHI'S RETURN WITH THE BRASS PLATES.\"]  When Laman, Lemuel and Sam saw Nephi coming they were very much frightened. They thought he was Laban, because he was dressed in Laban's clothes. They believed Nephi was killed and Laban was coming to kill them. So they began to run. Nephi called them, and they found it was their brother and not Laban.  By this time Zoram, who was with Nephi, became frightened and was going to run back into the city, but Nephi held him. Afterwards Nephi persuaded Zoram to go with him and promised him they would not hurt him.  This story shows us that the Lord does not ask His children to do anything that is impossible, or that they cannot do. He understands all things, and knows what His children are able to do. Nephi's doings teach us a very good lesson in perseverance and patience. We can see how, by trying again and not giving up, we can do things that seem impossible at first.  Points to be remembered in this story: Lehi sends his sons back to Jerusalem to get plates that contain an account or history of their forefathers--His older sons complain, but Nephi offers to go willingly--When the sons reach Jerusalem Laman goes to see Laban, the man who has the plates--Laban gets angry, calls Laman a robber, and says he will kill him--Laman runs away to save his life--The four brothers go to their father's old home and get the gold and silver and other precious things left there and offer them to Laban for the plates--Laban refuses to give up the plates, and sends his servants to kill Lehi's sons and take their property--Lehi's sons escape by hiding in a cave--They go the third time to get the plates--Nephi finds Laban drunk--Being commanded of the Lord, Nephi kills him and gets the plates from his servant==Nephi takes Zoram, Laban's servant, and the plates to where his brothers are outside the city.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  THE SONS' SECOND JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM.  While Lehi's sons were away on their errand to Jerusalem to get the records, their mother was very uneasy about them. She feared they might get killed or might die in the wilderness. When they came back both their father and mother were filled with joy, and were thankful to the Lord for their safe return.  Sometime after the sons' return to the place where they camped in the wilderness, their father was told by the Lord to send again to Jerusalem.  The Lord desired to lead Lehi and those who were with him to a country where there were no people. There was a man named Ishmael, living in Jerusalem who had several sons and daughters. The Lord commanded Lehi to send for Ishmael and invite him to go with them to the new country.  Lehi's sons were not married, and by getting Ishmael and his family to go with them the sons of Lehi might take Ishmael's daughters for wives. This was the reason why the Lord desired Lehi to send for Ishmael.  Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi were sent to Jerusalem for this family. When they reached Ishmael's house they told him what they had come for. Ishmael and his family were willing to go with them, and so they all traveled together into the wilderness.  While on their journey Nephi's two older brothers and some of Ishmael's sons and daughters rebelled against Nephi and the other members of Ishmael's family. That is, they refused to go with them. They wanted to return to Jerusalem. Nephi told them that if they did return they would be killed with the others who were there, as Jerusalem would surely be destroyed. Being blessed with the Spirit of the Lord, Nephi spoke with great power to his brethren. But this only made them angry. They became so angry that they took Nephi and bound him with cords. They wanted to kill him and leave him there in the wilderness to be eaten by wild beasts.  While Nephi was bound he prayed to the Lord to protect and save him from his wicked brothers. The Lord answered his prayers. The cords with which he was bound became loosened and he was set free.  Again, before they reached the end of their journey, Nephi's older brothers became angry and wanted to slay him. But this time Ishmael's wife and one of her sons and one daughter stopped them, and persuaded them to leave him alone.  Afterwards Laman and Lemuel felt very sorry for being so cruel to their brother. They asked him to forgive them for what they had done. Nephi at once forgave them, and was glad to see them repent of their wickedness. He loved his brothers even when they tried to take his life.

Then they all went on their journey and soon came to the place where Lehi and those who were with him were stopping.  This story shows again how the Lord watches over those who do right, and how he keeps them from harm when the wicked try to hurt them. Each time when Nephi was in danger the Lord saved him from all harm. This was because Nephi was a good man, and was obedient and faithful to the Lord. He was also obedient to his father Lehi, who loved him very much.  [Image captioned: \"NEPHI'S BRETHREN SEEK HIS LIFE.\"]  Points to be remembered in this story: Lehi's sons sent to Jerusalem a second time--Their errand is to invite a man named Ishmael and his family to join their father's family in the wilderness--As the Lord intended to lead Lehi and his family to a new country where there were no people, it was desirable that Ishmael go with them--Ishmael had several daughters, whom it was expected would become the wives of Lehi's sons--Ishmael and family agree to go into the wilderness--After starting Laman and Lemuel and some of Ishmael's family rebel and want to turn back--Nephi encourages them to keep on their journey--They become angry at Nephi and bind him with cords, intending to kill him--Nephi prays and the Lord loosens the cords and he gets free--Again Nephi's older brothers want to take his life, but Ishmael's wife and her son and daughter stop them and persuade them to leave him alone--Afterwards Laman and Lemuel are sorry and ask Nephi to forgive them--Nephi forgives his brothers and they all go on their journey and come to the place where Lehi is stopping--The Lord always takes care of those who obey Him.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  NEPHI'S VISION.  While Lehi was in the wilderness the Lord showed him in visions many things that would happen in the world a long time afterwards. A vision is something like a dream in which a person sees things as they really are or as they will be. When a vision is from the Lord that which is shown is something that has or will really happen. The way the Lord tells His prophets about what is going to take place is often by showing them a vision or a dream in which they see what is going to happen just as it will be when it takes place.  When Lehi had these visions he told about them to his children. Nephi was so interested or pleased with what his father told him that he wanted to see the visions for himself. So he prayed often to the Lord and asked Him to show him the things that his father Lehi saw. Nephi had such strong faith that he was enabled to receive an answer to his prayers.  At one time, when Nephi was thinking about what his father had seen, a vision of the Lord came to him. In this vision he was taken up into a high mountain. An angel of the Lord spoke to him and asked him what he desired. Nephi said he wished to see what his father had seen. The angel said to Nephi \"Look!\" Nephi looked and he saw Jerusalem as it would appear in six hundred years to come. Then he saw other cities. In the city of Nazareth which was near Jerusalem he saw a very beautiful virgin or young woman. The angel said this was the mother of the Savior.  [Image captioned \"NEPHI'S VISION.\"]  Soon after he looked again and saw this beautiful young woman with a child in her arms. The angel told Nephi that the child was the Savior, and that after many years from that time He would be born and live upon the earth. Nephi then saw the Savior grown to manhood, and He went to John the baptist to be baptized. After this the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghost rested upon the Savior and He went about teaching the people the gospel, telling them how they should live. He also healed the sick, and the blind and the lame, and raised dead persons to life. Nephi continued to look upon the vision and he saw the Savior taken by the wicked people and nailed to a cross and left there to die. The angel explained to Nephi that in this way the Savior would die for the sins of the world.  Afterwards appeared the Savior's apostles and then he saw that the wicked people in the world fought against the church the Savior started on the earth, and killed the saints who belonged to the church; then the people in the world were left for a long time without the gospel.  Many other things that have happened in the world since that time were seen by Nephi. He also saw things that have happened in this time when we live.  All the things which Nephi saw in this great vision came to pass just as he saw them many hundreds of years before. The Savior was born six hundred years after Nephi saw Him in this vision. His mother lived in the city of Nazareth where Nephi saw her. The Savior was baptized and went about teaching the people, healing the sick, the blind and the lame, and raising the dead. He was crucified, too, just as Nephi saw He would be; and the church which He started was destroyed on the earth, the saints being put to death by wicked men.  From this story we may learn that the Lord knows all about what will happen in this world. He knew before the world was made what would take place in the thousands of years to come. The Lord knows all things. He knows what each one of us may do or say. He even knows what we think, when we do not act or speak. When we say or do anything that is not right He knows about it, and is displeased. When we do good He sees it, and is pleased with us. If we try always to do right He will love us and will help us to do good.  We learn also from this story that the Lord tells good men about many things that are going to take place before they do happen. This is because He loves them.  By knowing what is going to happen beforehand these good men can often save themselves from danger or trouble.  In this way Lehi and his family were saved from death by leaving Jerusalem before it was destroyed. Lehi tried also to save the people of Jerusalem by telling them what was going to happen, but they would not believe him. They were so wicked they tried to kill him, and he had to leave to save his own life.  Points to be remembered in this story: Lehi sees many things in visions--He tells about them to his family--Nephi so pleased with hearing what his father tells he desires to see the things himself--An angel shows him a beautiful vision in which he sees the Savior and His mother--He also sees the Savior teaching the people and healing the sick--Sees Him nailed to a cross--Sees what happens afterwards--His church destroyed--The Lord knows all things--He tells His prophets many things that are going to take place.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  THEY CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY.  When Lehi moved into the wilderness he went as the Lord guided him. He was told that he would be led to a choice land, and he trusted in the Lord to be guided in the right direction.  Lehi and his company had been camping by the shore of the Red Sea for some time, when one night the Lord told Lehi to start again on his journey the next morning. He did not know which way to go, but he knew the Lord would show him, as He had done before.  The next morning when Lehi arose he saw lying on the ground near his tent door a ball made of fine brass. It was curiously formed. Inside the ball were two spindles, or needles. One of these needles pointed in the direction the people were to travel. The Lord had placed this ball by Lehi's tent door that he might use it as a guide on his journey. Lehi called this ball liahona.  As the Lord commanded, Lehi's company gathered up their property, their tents, provisions and seeds of all kinds, and started in the direction that was pointed out by the liahona, or brass ball. The reason they took seeds with them was that they might plant them in the country to which they were going. As they traveled along they camped from time to time in order to get food. While stopping at camp the men would take their bows and arrows and hunt animals, which they killed for food. In those days they did not have guns, as people have now. They used bows and arrows, and sometimes slings with which they would throw stones. They did not make fires to cook their food, but ate the meat raw. The Lord blessed the food for their sakes and it made them strong and healthy.  [Image captioned \"LEHI FINDS THE LIAHONA.\"]  Sometimes it was hard for the men to get enough food for all the company. The animals were not very plentiful, although the road they took was through the best part of the country, along the side of the Red Sea. But much of the country through which they traveled was rocky and barren. There was but little water to be found.  At one time when the company stopped Nephi broke his bow while he and his brethren were hunting. His brothers' bows about the same time lost their springs and were not as good as they had been. On this account they returned to camp without killing any animals, and so they were left without food.  Their bows were made of steel, and they had no way of mending them when broken. As they depended on these weapons for food they felt very sorrowful when Nephi's bow was broken. The people were hungry, and they did not know what to do to get food. Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael began to complain very much. Even Lehi complained at this time, for they were all suffering for food, and it was a very hard trial to them.  At last Nephi made a bow of wood, and out of a straight stick made an arrow. He then asked his father where he should go to get food. Lehi, not knowing where to direct him, inquired of the Lord. The Lord told Lehi to look at the ball of brass which he had found near his tent door. He did so, and there on the ball was writing which told just where he should go.  Lehi and Nephi found that the ball or liahona directed them according to their faith. When they lost faith it would not direct them, but when their faith was strong it would show them where to go or what to do.  According to the directions on the ball Nephi went"]]]
