But you're a good deckhand.\"  Len waited tensely, not knowing whether he did want the job or not.  \"The universe is opening up and sooner or later we're going to have to start diversifying our crews, take untrained men, maybe even--\" the officer hesitated--\"extraterrestrials. Sometimes training can restrict a man to the point where he can't think for himself. Main trouble with untrained men, though, is that often they've got too much imagination. They think things that aren't true, see things that aren't there.\"  \"I understand, sir,\" Mattern said. \"I'll keep my imagination stowed away until it's wanted.\"  From then on, he had seen no more at the ports than any of his properly conditioned mates.   IV  Len Mattern stayed with the _Perseus_ over three years. Gradually, from things he observed himself, from things his shipmates told him, he learned what little there was to be known about hyperspace. Everything was different there from normspace; even the mechanical properties of things changed. However, Jumping was safe enough, as long as the spaceships didn't stop. As long as they were only passing through that other universe, they were, in a sense, not actually there, so that the elements of which they were composed would not change, although, to the senses, they seemed to.  Unless, of course, the ship collided with something. Then everything became very real. That was what the pact was for--to make sure they didn't collide. Every spaceship had, locked in the captain's cabin, charts of that other universe--charts which gave, in normspace terms, the coordinates of the hyperspace worlds. That way, when a ship made the Jump, there would be no danger of her materializing inside one of the alien planets and destroying both. Even touching one of the hyper-worlds could have a disastrous effect. Only the captains were ever permitted to see these charts; they would be far too dangerous in irresponsible hands.  Len might have grown old in the _Perseus'_ service, if the Hesperia System hadn't been one of her stops, and if he hadn't seen Lyddy there.  Hesperia was a small, rose-pink sun surrounded by four planets and the debris of what once was a fifth. Most solar systems in the Galaxy had asteroid belts like that; some time later, Len found out why. Three of Hesperia's four planets were barren rocks. The fourth, Erytheia, was mostly water, calm water, sometimes blue, sometimes--when the sun was high--violet-tinged. There was land, a small continent in the north, where it was always spring, a slightly larger continent in the south, where it was always summer, and that large island in the west which was said to have a climate better than spring and summer combined.  The atmosphere of Erytheia was what they call Earth type--that is, Man could breathe on it. A very inadequate description, though, because men could breathe the atmosphere of Ziegler's Planet, too, only sometimes it almost seemed worthwhile to stop living in order to stop having to breathe Ziegler's air. Erytheia's atmosphere was gentler and purer than the air of Earth. The native fruits were edible and the local life-forms were small and amiable. But there wasn't enough land for the establishment of a self-supporting colony; it would have bred itself into poverty within a few generations.  What else could be done with a small paradise in a remote sector of space but turn it into a high-class brothel and gambling casino? Only the very rich could afford to travel so far to look at scenery, and by the time they reached their destination, scenery wasn't enough. They wanted some excitement.  Naturally, the _Perseus_ would stop at Hesperia. Naturally, Mattern would see Lyddy, who was one of the seven wonders of that system. She wasn't too many years out from Earth then, and he had never dreamed any woman could be that beautiful.         *       *       *       *       *  She was long-necked and slender, unlike the women of the Far Planets, who were mostly squat-built and bred for labor. It seemed to him he had seen her before--in a vision, a dream, who knew where? Certainly never in reality. But he could understand why men would travel light-years for her.  The prices she charged were also astronomical. Still, if he put away his money carefully, in a couple of years he ought to be able to save up enough for a night with her. It was a goal, and he'd never had a goal before, even such a small one; everything had been just aimless drifting. He got a tridi of her and put it up inside the door of his locker and was happy dreaming of her, even if it meant being kidded about her by his shipmates.  When he made the next Jump, he knew for certain that the creatures of hyperspace not only spoke to him through his mind, but could enter it and read it if they chose. He felt very naked and vulnerable. Why couldn't the others on his ship also see the creatures, so that he would not be the sole focus of their attentions?  \"Do what we ask,\" the hyperspacers--the xhindi, they called themselves--said softly, \"and you will have enough from just a single voyage to have her for a week, a month, a year. Do what we ask and you can have her for all eternity.\"  \"But all I want is just one night!\" he protested.  And they had laughed, and one with a honey-sweet mind had said, \"Is that _all_ you want, _really_ all?\" Then they began naming the things a man could want--and they certainly seemed to have a full knowledge of humanity and its most secret desires.  Afterward, Len had started to think. It _would_ be nice to have Lyddy all to himself--for a while, anyway. It would be nice to be able to buy her pretty dresses and jewelry. There were other things that would also be nice. Maybe he could have his teeth fixed and his leg straightened. His stepfather had broken it the night his mother died and it had never set properly. With money, he could do a lot of things. He hadn't realized there was so much in the universe to be wanted.  Now his wages began to look as picayune as once they had seemed large. He could make more elsewhere, he told himself; he might not be educated, but he had a good mind, plus rapidly dwindling principles. He didn't need the hyperspacers, though. There were plenty of illegal ways of making money within the framework of normspace activities. So he left the secure monotony of the starship to seek an enterprise which would bring in quick and copious profits.         *       *       *       *       *  His first step was to go see a rather disreputable acquaintance of his, Captain Ludolf Schiemann. Schiemann was an ancient spaceman from Earth, who owned and commanded a ramshackle craft of prehistoric design, held together with spit and spells.  Schiemann operated out of Capella IV with cargoes of whatever he could get. He was able to make a living with the _Valkyrie_ only because he would take on jobs that no sane skipper would touch. Some were dangerous; most were illegal into the bargain. The risks were out of all proportion to the profit, which was why the only helper he'd been able to get was Balas--a big, powerful man, not old but mad. He'd been a deckhand on one of the big starships and had broken too early to be entitled to a pension.  Mattern had met old Schiemann at a bar in Burdon, the capital of Capella IV, and had had a few drinks with him whenever the _Perseus_ and the _Valkyrie_ had happened to hit port at the same time. Schiemann had a favorite joke he kept repeating over and over: \"If you ever get sick of the _Perseus_, Lennie--sick of good food and hot water and decent quarters--you can always come to the _Valkyrie_. I'll take care of you.\"  Now Mattern went to him and said he'd like to take Schiemann up on that offer.  The old man's pale green eyes protruded even further from his head. \"You want to leave the _Perseus_ for a berth on my ship! You're madder than Balas!\"  \"Not a berth, Pop,\" Mattern told him. \"A share of her--a half share.\"  Schiemann grinned. \"Now you must think _I'm_ crazy, to hand over half my ship just like that. Maybe you'd like me to sign her over to you entirely.\" And he puffed savagely upon his Venuswood pipe.  \"Look,\" Len said, \"let's not kid ourselves. You're a crook, Pop, but such a lousy crook that you make it look as if crime really doesn't pay. And I'll tell you what's wrong with the way you operate. You have no organization, no system, no imagination. I have 'em all. You contribute the ship; I'll contribute my know-how. Together, we'll make a fortune.\"  \"Modest, aren't you?\" the old man jeered. \"What kind of know-how do you get working as a deckhand on a starboat? All right, maybe you're the universe's best metal polisher, but--\"  \"Look, Pop,\" Len interrupted, \"I'll make a deal with you. We work together for a year. If you don't pull in at least three times the amount you got before, as just your share, my half of the ship reverts to you. What could be fairer than that?\"  Schiemann still wasn't convinced that he was not being played for a sucker. Being what he was, he could never expose himself to a court battle, no matter how much justice might be on his side in a particular instance. But he didn't think Len could be so rotten as to figure on something like that. Besides, the old captain couldn't help liking the boy. So he agreed, saying as he did so, \"I should have my head examined.\" But before the fourth voyage was out, he realized that he had never done a wiser thing in his life. Under Len's direction, the _Valkyrie_ as a business enterprise was cleaning up.  Only in relative terms, of course. It took six months, over a dozen voyages, before Len managed to save enough for that night with Lyddy. And every time he made the Jump in the _Valkyrie_, the hyperspacers told him, \"One night won't be enough,\" and the honey-minded one had insisted, \"You must want more than that. You _must_. Who could be satisfied with so little?\"         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51844"],["title","Someone to Watch Over Me (#4)"],["body","lly, the night came. It was wonderful, it was ecstasy, it was everything he had dreamed of--but it was too short. \"Good-by, honey,\" Lyddy said as he left, \"come back and see me again.\"  \"When you have some more money,\" she meant. And it was all over.  For her, not for him. He found he couldn't get her out of his mind. One night was not enough. The xhindi had been right. Now he wanted her for his own, for the rest of his life if not for all eternity.  He had no romantic fancies that she would be willing to go off with him for the sake of true love and himself alone. He had seen himself too often in the mirror panel on the door of his tiny cabin, and he looked there now, with a chill objectivity. Undersized, crippled, pallid with the unhealthy color that comes from spending too little time in any kind of sunlight, Len Mattern was twenty-four and looked forty. Not even an ordinary woman of the planets could love him, let alone a love goddess.  But a love goddess who loved money could be bought. However, in order to win her, he'd need to have really big money. No matter how efficiently he organized the _Valkyrie's_ operations, the ship was just a battered old hulk and, in her sphere, could never be more than small-time. There was only one answer--hyperspace.  He found Schiemann puffing contentedly at his pipe in the _Valkyrie's_ control room. \"Look, Pop,\" he said, \"we've been wasting our time on stardust. We have to aim for something big.\"  Schiemann looked trustfully at the young man. He had no relatives, so he had come to think of Len as his son, and, in fact, had made him his heir. \"Whatever you say, Lennie. Figure on breaking out of this sector and moving in closer to Earth, do you?\"  \"Not exactly. We're going into hyperspace.\"  \"Sure,\" Schiemann said, blowing a smoke ring. \"Can't leave the sector without passing through hyperspace; that stands to reason. But where are we Jumping to?\"  Len tried to keep the tautening of his body from becoming apparent. \"We're not Jumping anywhere. We're _stopping_ in hyperspace.\"  The pipe dropped from the old man's mouth. He caught it in his hand and gave a muffled exclamation as the heat burned his palm. Then he looked at his partner. \"Of course you're joking, Lennie.\" And he arranged his face for laughter.  Len shook his head. \"No joke, Pop; I'm dead serious. We're going to take a cargo into hyperspace. To the mem--the mem--oh, hell, I can't pronounce it--the queen, I guess, of Ferr. That's one of their planets. She wants Earth stuff, she says, and she promises to do right by us if we bring it to her. Sounds like a good deal.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The silence thickened as the two men face each other. At last Schiemann got up. \"Look, Lennie, I don't make out I'm a saint. I've smuggled and cheated and stolen. But this I will not do. For the laws of the Federation, I don't give a damn--men made 'em and men can break 'em--but to go against the laws of nature, that is a different thing.\" He turned on his heel and went out of the control room.  Len went to his cabin and began to pack his gear. As he had expected, Schiemann interrupted him when he was halfway through. \"What do you think you're doing?\"  \"Leaving,\" Len said. \"I'm sick of small-time operations.\"  \"Leaving me? Just like that? Does our friendship mean nothing at all to you?\"  \"Sure it does,\" Len told him. \"When I get a chance, I'll write.\"  The old man's face crumpled. \"Look, Lennie, if we did move into one of the more important sectors, maybe--\"  \"You know we wouldn't have a chance there,\" Len said harshly, to conceal his true emotions. \"The sectors closer in to Earth have bigger, faster ships, and bigger, tougher men to run 'em. And they wouldn't like us trying to jet in!\"  \"I'd rather take a chance on that than--\"  \"We wouldn't _have_ a chance; it'd just be a massacre, with us on the receiving end. The only way we can break into the big time ourselves is through hyperspace. We've got to do what's never been done before.\"  That wasn't quite true, from what the xhindi had told him, but near enough. It had been done before, but not very often, and not very recently. However, it had been done, so it was possible to do. Otherwise he wouldn't think of chancing it ... or would he?  \"Why do you want money so much, Lennie?\" Schiemann asked. \"What do we need the big-time stuff for? It's nice and quiet and practically secure the way you've got things running for us, almost like we were honest businessmen. So why go looking for trouble?\"  \"If I'd wanted a quiet life,\" Len said, \"I'd have stuck with the _Perseus_. So don't sing me security.\"  The hand that held the pipe was trembling. \"Look, Lennie, at least give me time to think.\"  \"Okay,\" Len said. He was, in his way, fond of the old man, but there were bigger things at stake. He had to have Lyddy; he had to have money; he had to have ... something he couldn't put a name to, but desperately important nonetheless. \"I'll give you six months.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At the end of half a year, Schiemann said no, he positively wouldn't do it. Len said \"Good-by.\" Schiemann said, \"All right, but you'll be sorry; we'll all be sorry,\" and gave in.  So they took the _Valkyrie_, the two of them--and Balas, of course, but naturally nobody would consult a madman--and headed for hyperspace. Len knew exactly where to go, even though he had no charts. The breakthrough he wanted was in their own sector and it had been carefully marked for him in his mind.  Schiemann left all the details to him, even the selection of cargo. Len chose coal. He knew that what the xhindi wanted was normspace materials, but not precisely what materials. Their normspace value did not matter, because normspace matter changed to another form of itself when it got to hyperspace, and that was where the possibility of enormous profit came in. Something cheap in normspace could become something quite rare and expensive in hyperspace, and vice versa. The distribution of elements was different between the two universes; each one essentially complemented the other.  There was one hitch: a stable form in normspace could become an unstable one in hyperspace. Without empiric knowledge, it was impossible for anyone going from one universe into the other to tell whether any substance he was carrying or wearing or _was_ would remain stable. If unstable, it could turn into liquid or gas; it could turn into energy and blow up; it could cease to be a solid in any one of a number of ways.  As if that weren't bad enough, it could also happen that even a stuff previously proven to be stable in both universes could become unstable, if there was even the trace of a potentially unstable element, or if something that, stable in itself, combined with it in unstable fashion. Such an admixture could be accidental, which was what made the whole business especially tricky, and what made the reason for the inter-universe ban necessary.  The reason why that first load of the _Valkyrie's_ had been coal was a simple one. Somewhere, Len had read that coal and diamonds were different forms of the same normspace element, and he'd thought that might carry over into the other continuum. However, even an education wouldn't have helped him know what a right first cargo to take would have been. The xhindi had told him what they did know, but their terminology was not clear. They spoke his language with outward correctness but with imperfect conceptualization; he spoke theirs not at all. Much of what they did know, they appeared to have forgotten, or only half-learned.  They managed to make him understand that certain stuffs would be definitely unsafe; they could not make it clear which stuffs would be safe, or which they would find most desirable as trade goods. He gathered that they would be satisfied with anything that came through. So he chose coal, hoping to make a splendid initial impression.         *       *       *       *       *  The _Valkyrie_ reached hyperspace. It slowed down. The throbbing of its creaky engines ebbed to a hum. And it stopped and hung there in the quiet darkness of utterly alien time and place. Schiemann and Balas, expectedly, changed their appearance, but he had seen them in their monster guises before. The coal changed to something pale and glittering, but not diamonds. Everything remained quiet. The ship's instruments recorded no temperature change, but it seemed to grow colder and colder inside her.  Suddenly, Mattern knew the truth. A trap had been laid for him, and he had tumbled neatly into it. And the most shameful part was that his own desires and yearnings--deliberately fostered by the xhindi--had been the bait.  He wanted to turn to the horrible thing that Schiemann had become to scream, \"Let's go back!\" But he couldn't. Something held tight grip of his mind. And, looking out the portholes, he saw that the xhindi had begun to swarm.  The flickering terror of their appearance became more awesome to him than it had been at the beginning, when he'd been only a transitory shadow in hyperspace. Now, although he had no doubt that they were friendly--indeed, almost ardent in their welcoming--horror chilled him all over again. He could almost feel the molecules inside his body slow down as his viscera quivered faintly and then froze into stillness.  He looked at Schiemann and Balas. Neither of them could, he knew, see the hyperspacers. Their conditioning back on Earth's space schools had ensured this. That was the real reason for the schools; any actual training was incidental. But Schiemann knew the creatures were there, and so he could sense them. And Balas, too, certainly seemed to sense something as he stood there, tense and wary and almost _understanding_. It must be even worse, Len thought, to _know_ the hyperspacers were out there and not be able to see them.  \"We--we can still go back,\" Schiemann said in a cracked voice; apparently the minds outside had not touched his. \"Ple"]]]
