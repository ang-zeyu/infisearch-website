Close your eyes, stranger, and we will conduct you to your home.  Where shall we seek it?\"  \"'Tis in the Laughing Valley,\" answered Claus, shutting his eyes.  \"There is but one Laughing Valley in the known world, so we can not go astray,\" remarked the Knook.  As he spoke the sound of his voice seemed to die away, so Claus opened his eyes to see what caused the change.  To his astonishment he found himself seated on the bench by his own door, with the Laughing Valley spread out before him.  That day he visited the Wood-Nymphs and related his adventure to Queen Zurline and Necile.  \"The Awgwas have become your enemies,\" said the lovely Queen, thoughtfully; \"so we must do all we can to protect you from their power.\"  \"It was cowardly to bind him while he slept,\" remarked Necile, with indignation.  \"The evil ones are ever cowardly,\" answered Zurline, \"but our friend's slumber shall not be disturbed again.\"  The Queen herself came to the dwelling of Claus that evening and placed her Seal on every door and window, to keep out the Awgwas.  And under the Seal of Queen Zurline was placed the Seal of the Fairies and the Seal of the Ryls and the Seals of the Knooks, that the charm might become more powerful.  And Claus carried his toys to the children again, and made many more of the little ones happy.  You may guess how angry the King Awgwa and his fierce band were when it was known to them that Claus had escaped from the Forest of Ethop.  They raged madly for a whole week, and then held another meeting among the rocks.  \"It is useless to carry him where the Knooks reign,\" said the King, \"for he has their protection.  So let us cast him into a cave of our own mountains, where he will surely perish.\"  This was promptly agreed to, and the wicked band set out that night to seize Claus.  But they found his dwelling guarded by the Seals of the Immortals and were obliged to go away baffled and disappointed.  \"Never mind,\" said the King; \"he does not sleep always!\"  Next day, as Claus traveled to the village across the plain, where he intended to present a toy squirrel to a lame boy, he was suddenly set upon by the Awgwas, who seized him and carried him away to the mountains.  There they thrust him within a deep cavern and rolled many huge rocks against the entrance to prevent his escape.  Deprived thus of light and food, and with little air to breathe, our Claus was, indeed, in a pitiful plight.  But he spoke the mystic words of the Fairies, which always command their friendly aid, and they came to his rescue and transported him to the Laughing Valley in the twinkling of an eye.  Thus the Awgwas discovered they might not destroy one who had earned the friendship of the immortals; so the evil band sought other means of keeping Claus from bringing happiness to children and so making them obedient.  Whenever Claus set out to carry his toys to the little ones an Awgwa, who had been set to watch his movements, sprang upon him and snatched the toys from his grasp.  And the children were no more disappointed than was Claus when he was obliged to return home disconsolate.  Still he persevered, and made many toys for his little friends and started with them for the villages.  And always the Awgwas robbed him as soon as he had left the Valley.  They threw the stolen playthings into one of their lonely caverns, and quite a heap of toys accumulated before Claus became discouraged and gave up all attempts to leave the Valley.  Then children began coming to him, since they found he did not go to them; but the wicked Awgwas flew around them and caused their steps to stray and the paths to become crooked, so never a little one could find a way into the Laughing Valley.  Lonely days now fell upon Claus, for he was denied the pleasure of bringing happiness to the children whom he had learned to love.  Yet he bore up bravely, for he thought surely the time would come when the Awgwas would abandon their evil designs to injure him.  He devoted all his hours to toy-making, and when one plaything had been completed he stood it on a shelf he had built for that purpose.  When the shelf became filled with rows of toys he made another one, and filled that also.  So that in time he had many shelves filled with gay and beautiful toys representing horses, dogs, cats, elephants, lambs, rabbits and deer, as well as pretty dolls of all sizes and balls and marbles of baked clay painted in gay colors.  Often, as he glanced at this array of childish treasures, the heart of good old Claus became sad, so greatly did he long to carry the toys to his children.  And at last, because he could bear it no longer, he ventured to go to the great Ak, to whom he told the story of his persecution by the Awgwas, and begged the Master Woodsman to assist him.    7.  The Great Battle Between Good and Evil  Ak listened gravely to the recital of Claus, stroking his beard the while with the slow, graceful motion that betokened deep thought.  He nodded approvingly when Claus told how the Knooks and Fairies had saved him from death, and frowned when he heard how the Awgwas had stolen the children's toys.  At last he said:  \"From the beginning I have approved the work you are doing among the children of men, and it annoys me that your good deeds should be thwarted by the Awgwas.  We immortals have no connection whatever with the evil creatures who have attacked you.  Always have we avoided them, and they, in turn, have hitherto taken care not to cross our pathway. But in this matter I find they have interfered with one of our friends, and I will ask them to abandon their persecutions, as you are under our protection.\"  Claus thanked the Master Woodsman most gratefully and returned to his Valley, while Ak, who never delayed carrying out his promises, at once traveled to the mountains of the Awgwas.  There, standing on the bare rocks, he called on the King and his people to appear.  Instantly the place was filled with throngs of the scowling Awgwas, and their King, perching himself on a point of rock, demanded fiercely:  \"Who dares call on us?\"  \"It is I, the Master Woodsman of the World,\" responded Ak.  \"Here are no forests for you to claim,\" cried the King, angrily.  \"We owe no allegiance to you, nor to any immortal!\"  \"That is true,\" replied Ak, calmly.  \"Yet you have ventured to interfere with the actions of Claus, who dwells in the Laughing Valley, and is under our protection.\"  Many of the Awgwas began muttering at this speech, and their King turned threateningly on the Master Woodsman.  \"You are set to rule the forests, but the plains and the valleys are ours!\" he shouted.  \"Keep to your own dark woods!  We will do as we please with Claus.\"  \"You shall not harm our friend in any way!\" replied Ak.  \"Shall we not?\" asked the King, impudently.  \"You will see!  Our powers are vastly superior to those of mortals, and fully as great as those of immortals.\"  \"It is your conceit that misleads you!\" said Ak, sternly.  \"You are a transient race, passing from life into nothingness.  We, who live forever, pity but despise you.  On earth you are scorned by all, and in Heaven you have no place!  Even the mortals, after their earth life, enter another existence for all time, and so are your superiors.  How then dare you, who are neither mortal nor immortal, refuse to obey my wish?\"  The Awgwas sprang to their feet with menacing gestures, but their King motioned them back.  \"Never before,\" he cried to Ak, while his voice trembled with rage, \"has an immortal declared himself the master of the Awgwas!  Never shall an immortal venture to interfere with our actions again!  For we will avenge your scornful words by killing your friend Claus within three days.  Nor you, nor all the immortals can save him from our wrath.  We defy your powers!  Begone, Master Woodsman of the World!  In the country of the Awgwas you have no place.\"  \"It is war!\" declared Ak, with flashing eyes.  \"It is war!\" returned the King, savagely.  \"In three days your friend will be dead.\"  The Master turned away and came to his Forest of Burzee, where he called a meeting of the immortals and told them of the defiance of the Awgwas and their purpose to kill Claus within three days.  The little folk listened to him quietly.  \"What shall we do?\" asked Ak.  \"These creatures are of no benefit to the world,\" said the Prince of the Knooks; \"we must destroy them.\"  \"Their lives are devoted only to evil deeds,\" said the Prince of the Ryls.  \"We must destroy them.\"  \"They have no conscience, and endeavor to make all mortals as bad as themselves,\" said the Queen of the Fairies.  \"We must destroy them.\"  \"They have defied the great Ak, and threaten the life of our adopted son,\" said beautiful Queen Zurline.  \"We must destroy them.\"  The Master Woodsman smiled.  \"You speak well,\" said he.  \"These Awgwas we know to be a powerful race, and they will fight desperately; yet the outcome is certain.  For we who live can never die, even though conquered by our enemies, while every Awgwa who is struck down is one foe the less to oppose us. Prepare, then, for battle, and let us resolve to show no mercy to the wicked!\"  Thus arose that terrible war between the immortals and the spirits of evil which is sung of in Fairyland to this very day.  The King Awgwa and his band determined to carry out the threat to destroy Claus.  They now hated him for two reasons: he made children happy and was a friend of the Master Woodsman.  But since Ak's visit they had reason to fear the opposition of the immortals, and they dreaded defeat.  So the King sent swift messengers to all parts of the world to summon every evil creature to his aid.  And on the third day after the declaration of war a mighty army was at the command of the King Awgwa.

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.  “What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.  Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. “How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.  “Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.  He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”, he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.”  And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. “God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.  He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it was his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the other side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well? Do you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.  The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.  It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.  The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.  So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness. "]]]
