I have none in my hand--none at my belt.  I keep it here!\"  He stooped, raised his right trousers leg, and drew from his Wellington boot a two-edged, pointed thing almost long enough to merit the name of rapier.  He tossed it in the air, let it spin six or seven times end over end, caught it deftly by the point, and returned it to its hiding-place.  \"I am a law-abiding man,\" he said, \"but where the law leaves off, I know where to begin!  I am no fool!\"  Monty made up his mind there and then that this man's game would not be worth the candle.  \"No, Mr. Coutlass, I can't oblige you,\" he said.  The Greek half-arose and then sat down again.  \"You can not find it without my assistance!\" he said, wrinkling his face for emphasis.  \"I'm not looking for assistance,\" said Monty.  \"Aha!  You play with words!  You are not--but you will!  I am no fool, my Lord!  I understand!  Not for nothing did I make a friend again of that pig Hassan!  Not for nothing have I waited all these months in this stinking Zanzibar until a man should come in search of that ivory whom I could trust!  Not for nothing did Juma, the lazaretto attendant tell Hassan you desired to see him!  You seek the ivory, but you wish to keep it all!  To share none of it with me!\"  He stood up, and made another bow, much curter than his former one.  \"I am Georges Coutlass! My courage is known!  No man can rob me and get away with it!\"  \"My good man,\" drawled Monty, raising his eyebrows in the comfortless way he has when there seems need of facing an inferior antagonist.  (He hates to \"lord it\" as thoroughly as he loves to risk his neck.)  \"I would not rob you if you owned the earth!  If you have valuable information I'll pay for it cheerfully after it's tested.\"  \"Ah!  Now you talk!\"  \"Observe--I said after it's tested!\"  \"I don't think he knows anything,\" said Fred.  \"I think he guessed a lot, and wants to look, and can't afford to pay his own expenses. Isn't that it?\"  \"What do you mean?\" demanded Coutlass.  \"I can't talk Greek,\" said Fred. \"Shall I say it again in English?\"  \"You may name any reasonable price,\" said Monty, \"for real information. Put it in writing.  When we're agreed on the price, put that in writing too.  Then, if we find the information is even approximately right, why, we'll pay for it.\"  \"Ah-h-h!  You intend to play a trick on me!  You use my information! You find the ivory!  You go out by the Congo River and the other coast, and I kiss myself good-by to you and ivory and money!  I am to be what d'you call it?--a milk-pigeon!\"  \"Being that must be some sensation!\" nodded Yerkes.  \"I warn you I can not be tampered with!\" snarled the Greek, putting on his hat with a flourish.  \"I leave you, for you to think it over!  But I tell you this--I promise you--I swear!  Any expedition in search of that ivory that does not include Georges Coutlass on his own terms is a delusion--a busted flush--smashed--exploded--pfff!--so--evanesced before the start!  My address is Zanzibar!  Every street child knows me!  When you wish to know my terms, tell the first man or child you meet to lead you to the house where Georges Coutlass lives!  Good morning, Lord Skirtsshubrish!  We will no doubt meet again!\"  He turned his back on us and strode from the room--a man out of the middle ages, soldierly of bearing, unquestionably bold, and not one bit more venial or lawless than ninety per cent. of history's gallants, if the truth were told.  \"Let's hope that's the last of him!\" said Monty.  \"Can't say I like him, but I'd hate to have to spoil his chances.\"  \"Last of him be sugared!\" said Yerkes.  \"That's only the first of him! He'll find seven devils worse than himself and camp on our trail, if I know anything of Greeks--that's to say, if our trail leads after that ivory.  Does it?\"  \"Depends,\" said Monty.  \"Let's talk upstairs.  That Syrian has long ears.\"  So we trooped to Monty's room, where the very cobwebs reeked of Arab history and lawless plans.  He sat on the black iron bed, and we grouped ourselves about on chairs that had very likely covered the known world between them.  One was obviously jetsam from a steamship; one was a Chinese thing, carved with staggering dragons; the other was made of iron-hard wood that Yerkes swore came from South America.  \"Shoot when you're ready!\" grinned Yerkes.  I was too excited to sit still.  So was Fred.  \"Get a move on, Didums, for God's sake!\" he growled.  \"Well,\" said Monty, \"there seems something in this ivory business.  Our chance ought to be as good as anybody's.  But there are one or two stiff hurdles.  In the first place, the story is common property. Every one knows it--Arabs--Swahili--Greeks--Germans--English.  To be suspected of looking for it would spell failure, for the simple reason that every adventurer on the coast would trail us, and if we did find it we shouldn't be able to keep the secret for five minutes.  If we found it anywhere except on British territory it 'ud be taken away from us before we'd time to turn round.  And it isn't buried on British territory!  I've found out that much.\"  \"Good God, Didums!  D'you mean you know where the stuff is?\"  Fred sat forward like a man at a play.  \"I know where it isn't,\" said Monty.  \"They told me at the Residency that in all human probability it's buried part in German East, and by far the greater part in the Congo.\"  \"Then that ten per cent. offer by the British is a bluff?\" asked Yerkes.  \"Out of date,\" said Monty.  \"The other governments offer nothing.  The German government might make terms with a German or a Greek--not with an Englishman.  The Congo government is an unknown quantity, but would probably see reason if approached the proper way.\"  \"The U. S. Consul tells me,\" said Yerkes, \"that the Congo government is the rottenest aggregate of cutthroats, horse-thieves, thugs, yeggs, common-or-ordinary hold-ups, and sleight-of-hand professors that the world ever saw in one God-forsaken country.  He says they're of every nationality, but without squeam of any kind--hang or shoot you as soon as look at you!  He says if there's any ivory buried in those parts they've either got it and sold it, or else they buried it themselves and spread the story for a trap to fetch greenhorns over the border!\"  \"That man's after the stuff himself!\" said Fred.  \"All he wanted to do was stall you off!\"  \"That man Schillingschen the doctor told us about,\" said Monty, \"is suspected of knowing where to look for some of the Congo hoard.  He'll bear watching.  He's in British East Africa at present--said to be combing Nairobi and other places for a certain native.  He is known to stand high in the favor of the German government, but poses as a professor of ethnology.\"  \"He shall study deathnology,\" said Fred, \"if he gets in my way!\"  \"The Congo people,\" said Monty, \"would have dug up the stuff, of course, if they'd known where to look for it.  Our people believe that the Germans do know whereabouts to look for it, but dread putting the Congo crowd on the scent.  If we're after it we've got to do two things besides agreeing between ourselves.\"  \"Deal me in, Monty!\" said Yerkes.  \"Nil desperandum, Didums duce, then!\" said Fred.  \"I propose Monty for leader.  Those against the motion take their shirts off, and see if they can lick me!  Nobody pugnacious?  The ayes have it!  Talk along, Didums!\"  For all Fred's playfulness, Yerkes and I came in of our free and considered will, and Monty understood that.  \"We've got to separate,\" he said, \"and I've got to interview the King of Belgium.\"  \"If that were my job,\" grinned Yerkes, \"I'd prob'ly tell him things!\"  \"I don't pretend to like him,\" said Monty. \"But it seems to me I can serve our best interests by going to Brussels.  He can't very well refuse me a private audience.  I should get a contract with the Congo government satisfactory to all concerned.  He's rapacious--but I think not ninety per cent. rapacious.\"  \"Good,\" said I, \"but why separate?\"  \"If we traveled toward the Congo from this place in a bunch,\" said Monty, \"we should give the game away completely and have all the rag-tag and bob-tail on our heels.  As it is, our only chance of shaking all of them would be to go round by sea and enter the Congo from the other side; but that would destroy our chance of picking up the trail in German East Africa.  So I'll go to Brussels, and get back to British East as fast as possible.  Fred must go to British East and watch Schillingschen.  You two fellows may as well go by way of British East Africa to Muanza on Victoria Nyanza, and on from there to the Congo border by way of Ujiji.  Yerkes is an American, and they'll suspect him less than any of us (they'd nail me, of course, in a minute!)  So let Yerkes make a great show of looking for land to settle on.  We'll all four meet on the Congo border, at some other place to be decided later.  We'll have to agree on a code, and keep in touch by telegraph as often as possible.  Now, is all that clear?\"  \"We two'll have all the Greeks of Zanzibar trailing us all the way!\" objected Yerkes.  \"That'll be better than having them trail the lot of us,\" said Monty. \"You'll be able to shake them somewhere on the way.  We'll count on your ingenuity, Will.\"  \"But what am I to do to Schillingschen?\" asked Fred.  \"Keep an eye on him.\"  \"Do you see me Sherlock-Holmesing him across the high veld? Piffle! Give America that job!  I'll go through German East and keep ahead of the Greeks!\"  But Monty was firm.  \"Yerkes has a plausible excuse, Fred.  They may wonder why an American should look for land in German East Africa, but they'll let him do it, and perhaps not spy on him to any extent.  It's me they've their eye on.  I'll try to keep 'em dazzled.  You go to British East and dazzle Schillingschen! Now, are we agreed?\"  We were.  But we talked, nevertheless, long into the afternoon, and in the end there was not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5194"],["title","The Ivory Trail (#7)"],["body","of us really satisfied.  Over and over we tried to persuade Monty to omit the Brussels part of the plan.  We wanted him with us.  But he stuck to his point, and had his way, as he always did when we were quite sure he really wanted it.     CHAPTER TWO   THE NJO HAPA SONG    Gleam, oh brighter than jewels! gleam my swinging stars in         the opal dark,   Mirrored along wi' the fire-fly dance of 'longshore light and         off-shore mark,   The roof-lamps and the riding lights, and phosphor wake of         ship and shark.          I was old when the fires of Arab ships         (All seas were lawless then!)         Abode the tide where liners ride         To-day, and Malays then,--         Old when the bold da Gama came         With culverin and creed         To trade where Solomon's men fought,         And plunder where the banyans bought,         I sighed when the first o' the slaves were brought,         And laughed when the last were freed.    Deep, oh deeper than anchors drop, the bones o' the outbound         sailors lie,   Far, oh farther than breath o' wind the rumors o' fabled         fortune fly,   And the 'venturers yearn from the ends of earth, for none o'         the isles is as fair as I!   The enormous map of Africa loses no lure or mystery from the fact of nearness to the continent itself.  Rather it increases.  In the hot upper room that night, between the wreathing smoke of oil lamps, we pored over the large scale map Monty had saved from the wreck along with our money drafts and papers.  The atmosphere was one of bygone piracy.  The great black ceiling beams, heavy-legged table of two-inch planks, floor laid like a dhow's deck--making utmost use of odd lengths of timber, but strong enough to stand up under hurricanes and overloads of plunder, or to batten down rebellious slaves--murmurings from rooms below, where men of every race that haunts those shark-infested seas were drinking and telling tales that would make Munchhausen's reputation--steaminess, outer darkness, spicy equatorial smells and, above all, knowledge of the nature of the coming quest united to veil the map in fascination.  No man gifted with imagination better than a hot-cross bun's could be in Zanzibar and not be conscious of the lure that made adventurers of men before the first tales were written.  Old King Solomon's traders must have made it their headquarters, just as it was Sindbad the Sailor's rendezvous and that of pirates before he or Solomon were born or thought of.  Vasco da Gama, stout Portuguese gentleman adventurer, conquered it, and no doubt looted the godowns to a lively tune.  Wave after wave of Arabs sailed to it (as they do today) from that other land of mystery, Arabia; and there isn't a yard of coral beach, cocoanut-fringed shore, clove orchard, or vanilla patch--not a lemon tree nor a thousand-year-old baobab but could tell of battle and intrigue; not a creek where the dhows lie peacefully today but could whisper of cargoes run by night--black cargoes, groaning fretfully and smelling of the 'tween-deck lawlessness.  \"There are two things that have stuck in my memory that Lord Salisbury used to say when I was an Eton boy, spending a holiday at Hatfield House,\" said Monty.  \"One was, Never talk fight unless you mean fight; then fight, don't talk.  The other was, Always study the largest maps.\"  \"Who's talking fight?\" demanded Fred.  Monty ignored him.  \"Even this map isn't big enough to give a real idea of distances, but it helps.  You see, there's no railway beyond Victoria Nyanza.  Anything at all might happen in those great spaces beyond Uganda.  Borderlands are quarrel-grounds.  I should say the junction of British, Belgian, and German territory where Arab loot lies buried is the last place to dally in unarmed.  You fellows 'ud better scour Zanzibar in the morning for the best guns to be had here.\"  So I went to bed at midnight with that added stuff for building dreams. He who has bought guns remembers with a thrill; he who has not, has in store for him the most delightful hours of life.  May he fall, as our lot was, on a gunsmith who has mended hammerlocks for Arabs, and who loves rifles as some greater rascals love a woman or a horse.  We all four strolled next morning, clad in the khaki reachmedowns that a Goanese \"universal provider\" told us were the \"latest thing,\" into a den between a camel stable and an even mustier-smelling home of gloom, where oxen tied nose-to-tail went round and round, grinding out semsem everlastingly while a lean Swahili sang to them.  When he ceased, they stopped.  When he sang, they all began again.  In a bottle-shaped room at the end of a passage squeezed between those two centers of commerce sat the owner of the gun-store, part Arab, part Italian, part Englishman, apparently older than sin itself, toothless, except for one yellow fang that lay like an ornament over his lower lip, and able to smile more winningly than any siren of the sidewalk. Evidently he shaved at intervals, for white stubble stood out a third of an inch all over his wrinkled face.  The upper part of his head was utterly bald, slippery, shiny, smooth, and adorned by an absurd, round Indian cap, too small, that would not stay in place and had to be hitched at intervals.  He said his name was Captain Thomas Cook, and the license to sell firearms framed on the mud-brick wall bore him witness.  (May he live forever under any name he chooses!)  \"Goons?\" he said. \"Goons?  You gentlemen want goons?  I have the goon what settled the hash of Sayed bin Mohammed--here it be.  This other one's the rifle--see the nicks on her butt!--that Kamarajes the Greek used.  See 'em--Arab goons--slaver goons--smooth-bore elephant goons--fours, eights, twelves--Martinis--them's the lot that was reekin' red-hot, days on end, in the last Arab war on the Congo, considerable used up but goin' cheap;--then here's Mausers (he pronounced it \"Morsers\")--old-style, same as used in 1870--good goons they be, long o' barrel and strong, but too high trajectory for some folks;--some's new style, magazines an' all--fine till a grain o' sand jams 'em oop;--an' Lee-Enfields, souvenirs o' the Boer War, some o' them bought from folks what plundered a battle-field or two--mostly all in good condition.  Look at this one--see it--hold it--take a squint along it!  Nineteen elephants shot wi' that Lee-Enfield, an' the man's in jail for shootin' of 'em!  Sold at auction by the gov'ment, that one was.  See, here's an Express--a beauty--owned by an officer fr'm Indy--took by a shark 'e was, in swimmin' against all advice, him what had hunted tigers!  There's no goon store a quarter as good as mine 'tween Cairo an' the Cape or Bombay an-' Boma!  Captain Cook's the boy to sell ye goons all right!  Sit down.  Look 'em over.  Ask anything ye want to know.  I'll tell ye.  No obligation to buy.\"  There is no need to fit out with guns and tents in London.  Until both good and bad, both cowardly and brave give up the habit of dying in bed, or getting killed, or going broke, or ending up in jail for one cause and the other, there will surely always be fine pickings for men on the spot with a little money and a lot of patience--guns, tents, cooking pots, and all the other things.  We spent a morning with Captain Thomas Cook, and left the store--Fred, Yerkes and I--with a battery of weapons, including a pistol apiece--that any expedition might be proud of.  (Monty, since he had to go home in any case, preferred to look over the family gun-room before committing himself.)  Then, since the first leg of the journey would be the same for all of us we bought other kit, packed it, and booked passages for British East Africa.  Between then and the next afternoon when the British India steamboat sailed we were fairly bombarded by inquisitiveness, but contrived not to tell much.  And with patience beyond belief Monty restrained us from paying court to Tippoo Tib.  \"The U. S. Consul says he's better worth a visit than most of the world's museums,\" Yerkes assured us two or three times.  \"He says Tippoo Tib's a fine old sport--damned rogue--slave-hunter, but white somewhere near the middle.  What's the harm in our having a chin with him?\"  But Monty was adamant.  \"A call on him would prove nothing, but he and his friends would suspect.  Spies would inform the German government.  No.  Let's act as if Tippoo Tib were out of mind.\"  We grumbled, but we yielded.  Hassan came again, shiny with sweat and voluble with offers of information and assistance.  \"Where you gentlemen going?\" he kept asking.  \"England,\" said Monty, and showed his own steamer ticket in proof of it.  That settled Hassan for the time but Georges Coutlass was not so easy. He came swaggering upstairs and thumped on Monty's door with the air of a bearer of king's messages.  \"What do you intend to do?\" he asked.  (We were all sitting on Monty's bed, and it was Yerkes who opened the door.)  \"Do you an injury,\" said Yerkes, \"unless you take your foot away!\"  The Greek had placed it deftly to keep the door open pending his convenience.  \"Let him have his say\" advised Monty from the bed.  \"Where are you going?  Hassan told me England.  Are you all going to England?  If so, why have you bought guns?  What will you do with six rifles, three shot-guns, and three pistols on the London streets?  What will you do with tents in London?  Will you make campfires in Regent Circus, that you take with you all those cooking pots?  And all that rice, is that for the English to eat?  Bah!  No tenderfoot can fool me! You go to find my ivory, d'you hear!  You think to get away with it unknown to me!  I tell you I have sharp ears!  By Jingo; there is nothing I can not find out that goes on in Africa!  You think to cheat me?  Then you are as good as dead men!  You shall die like dogs!  I will smithereen the whole damned lot of you before you touch a tusk!\"  \"Get out of here!\" growled Yerkes.  \"Give him a chance to go quietly,"]]]
