Still, we were not as silly and ignorant as we were at Bunker Hill, having learned something of authority and respect in these three years, and how necessary to discipline was a proper maintenance of rank. For once--though it seems incredible--men and officers were practically on a footing of ignorant familiarity; and I have heard, and fully believe, that the majority of our reverses and misfortunes arose because no officer represented authority, nor knew how to enforce discipline because lacking that military respect upon which all real discipline must be founded.  Of all the officers in my corps and in my company, perhaps Lieutenant Boyd was slowest to learn the lesson and most prone to relax, not toward the rank and file--yet, he was often a shade too easy there, also--but with other officers. Those ranking him were not always pleased; those whom he ranked felt vaguely the mistake.  As for me, I liked him greatly; yet, somehow, never could bring myself to a careless comradeship, even in the woods or on lonely scouts where formality and circumstance seemed out of place, even absurd. He was so much of a boy, too--handsome, active, perfectly fearless, and almost always gay--that if at times he seemed a little selfish or ruthless in his pleasures, not sufficiently mindful of others or of consequences, I found it easy to forgive and overlook. Yet, fond as I was of him, I never had become familiar with him--why, I do not know. Perhaps because he ranked me; and perhaps there was no particular reason for that instinct of aloofness which I think was part of me at that age, and, except in a single instance, still remains as the slightest and almost impalpable barrier to a perfect familiarity with any person in the world.  \"Loskiel,\" he said in my ear, \"did you see that little maid in the orchard, how shyly she smiled on us?\"  \"On you,\" I nodded, laughing.  \"Oh, you always say that,\" he retorted.  And I always did say that, and it always pleased him.  \"On this accursed journey south,\" he complained, \"the necessity for speed has spoiled our chances for any roadside sweethearts. Lord! But it's been a long, dull trail,\" he added frankly. \"Why, look you, Loskiel, even in the wilderness somehow I always have contrived to discover a sweetheart of some sort or other--yes, even in the Iroquois country, cleared or bush, somehow or other, sooner or later, I stumble on some pretty maid who flutters up in the very wilderness like a partridge from under my feet!\"  \"That is your reputation,\" I remarked.  \"Oh, damme, no!\" he protested. \"Don't say it is my reputation!\"  But he had that reputation, whether he realised it or not; though as far as I had seen there was no real harm in the man--only a willingness to make love to any petticoat, if its wearer were pretty. But my own notions had ever inclined me toward quality. Which is not strange, I myself being of unknown parentage and birth, high or low, nobody knew; nor had anybody ever told me how I came by my strange name, Euan Loskiel, save that they found the same stitched in silk upon my shift.  For it is best, perhaps, that I say now how it was with me from the beginning, which, until this memoir is read, only one man knew--and one other. For I was discovered sleeping beside a stranded St. Regis canoe, where the Mohawk River washes Guy Park gardens. And my dead mother lay beside me.  He who cared for me, reared me and educated me, was no other than Guy Johnson of Guy Park. Why he did so I learned only after many days; and at the proper time and place I will tell you who I am and why he was kind to me. For his was not a warm and kindly character, nor a gentle nature, nor was he an educated man himself, nor perhaps even a gentleman, though of that landed gentry which Tryon County knew so well, and also a nephew of the great Sir William, and became his son-in-law.  I say he was not liked in Tryon County, though many feared him more than they feared young Walter Butler later; yet he was always and invariably kind to me. And when with the Butlers, and Sir John, and Colonel Claus, and the other Tories he fled to Canada, there to hatch most hellish reprisals upon the people of Tryon who had driven him forth, he wrote to me where I was at Harvard College in Cambridge to bid me farewell.  He said to me in that letter that he did not ask me to declare for the King in the struggle already beginning; he merely requested, if I could not conscientiously so declare, at least that I remain passive, and attend quietly to my studies at Cambridge until the war blew over, as it quickly must, and these insolent people were taught their lesson.  The lesson, after three years and more, was still in progress; Guy Park had fallen into the hands of the Committee of Sequestration and was already sold; Guy Johnson roamed a refugee in Canada, and I, since the first crack of a British musket, had learned how matters stood between my heart and conscience, and had carried a rifle and at times my regiment's standard ever since.  I had no home except my regiment, no friends except Guy Johnson's, and those I had made at College and in the regiment; and the former would likely now have greeted me with rifle or hatchet, whichever came easier to hand.  So to me my rifle regiment and my company had become my only home; the officers my parents; my comrades the only friends I had.  I wrote to Guy Johnson, acquainting him of my intention before I enlisted, and the letter went to him with other correspondence under a flag.  In time I had a reply from him, and he wrote as though something stronger than hatred for the cause I had embraced was forcing him to speak to me gently.  God knows it was a strange, sad letter, full of bitterness under which smouldered something more terrible, which, as he wrote, he strangled. And so he ended, saying that, through him, no harm should ever menace me; and that in the fullness of time, when this vile rebellion had been ended, he would vouch for the mercy of His Most Christian Majesty as far as I was concerned, even though all others hung in chains.  Thus I had left it all--not then knowing who I was or why Guy Johnson had been kind to me; nor ever expecting to hear from him again.   Thinking of these things as I rode beside Lieutenant Boyd through the calm Westchester sunshine, all that part of my life--which indeed was all of my life except these last three battle years--seemed already so far sway, so dim and unreal, that I could scarce realise I had not been always in the army--had not always lived from day to day, from hour to hour, not knowing one night where I should pillow my head the next.  For at nineteen I shouldered my rifle; and now, at Boyd's age, two and twenty, my shoulder had become so accustomed to its not unpleasant weight that, at moments, thinking, I realised that I would not know what to do in the world had I not my officers, my company, and my rifle to companion me through life.  And herein lies the real danger of all armies and of all soldiering. Only the strong character and exceptional man is ever fitted for any other life after the army becomes a closed career to him.  I now remarked as much to Boyd, who frowned, seeming to consider the matter for the first time.  \"Aye,\" he nodded, \"it's true enough, Loskiel. And I for one don't know what use I could make of the blessings of peace for which we are so madly fighting, and which we all protest that we desire.\"  \"The blessings of peace might permit you more leisure with the ladies,\" I suggested smilingly. And he threw back his handsome head and laughed.  \"Lord!\" he exclaimed. \"What chance have I, a poor rifleman, who may not even wear his hair clubbed and powdered.\"  Only field and staff now powdered in our corps. I said: \"Heaven hasten your advancement, sir.\"  \"Not that I'd care a fig,\" he protested, \"if I had your yellow, curly head, you rogue. But with my dark hair unpowdered and uncurled, and no side locks, I tell you, Loskiel, I earn every kiss that is given me--or forgiven. Heigho! Peace would truly be a blessing if she brought powder and pretty clothing to a crop-head, buck-skinned devil like me.\"  We were now riding through a country which had become uneven and somewhat higher. A vast wooded hill lay on our left; the Bedford highway skirted it. On our right ran a stream, and there was some swampy land which followed. Rock outcrops became more frequent, and the hard-wood growth of oak, hickory and chestnut seemed heavier and more extensive than in Bedford town. But there were orchards; the soil seemed to be fertile and the farms thrifty, and it was a pleasant land save for the ominous stillness over all and the grass-grown highway. Roads and lanes, paths and pastures remained utterly deserted of man and beast.  This, if our map misled us not, should be the edges of the town of Poundridge; and within a mile or so more we began to see a house here and there. These farms became more frequent as we advanced. After a few moments' riding we saw the first cattle that we had seen in many days. And now we began to find this part of the Westchester country very different, as we drew nearer to the village, for here and there we saw sheep feeding in the distance, and men mowing who leaned on their scythes to see us pass, and even saluted us from afar.  It seemed as though a sense of security reigned here, though nobody failed to mark our passing or even to anticipate it from far off. But nobody appeared to be afraid of us, and we concluded that the near vicinity of Colonel Sheldon's Horse accounted for what we saw.  It was pleasant to see women spinning beside windows in which flowers bloomed, and children gazing shyly at us from behind stone walls and palings. Also, in barnyards we saw fowls, which was more than we had seen West of us--and now and again a family cat dozing on some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4984"],["title","The Hidden Children (#4)"],["body","freshly swept.  \"I had forgotten there was such calm and peace in the world,\" said Boyd. \"And the women look not unkindly on us--do you think, Loskiel?\"  But I was intent on watching a parcel of white ducks leaving a little pond, all walking a-row and quacking, and wriggling their fat tails. How absurd a thing to suddenly close my throat so that I could not find my voice to answer Boyd; for ever before me grew the almost forgotten vision of Guy Park, and of our white waterfowl on the river behind the house, where I had seen them so often from my chamber window leaving the water's edge at sundown.  A mile outside the town a leather-helmeted dragoon barred our way, but we soon satisfied him.  We passed by the Northwest road, crossed the Stamford highway, and, consulting our map, turned back and entered it, riding south through the village.  Here a few village folk were abroad; half a dozen of Sheldon's dragoons lounged outside the tavern, to the rail of which their horses were tied; and we saw other men with guns, doubtless militia, though few wore any fragment of uniform, save as their hats were cocked or sprigged with green.  Nobody hailed us, not even the soldiers; there was no levity, no jest directed toward our giant rifleman, only a courteous but sober salute as we rode through Poundridge town and out along the New Canaan highway where houses soon became fewer and soldiers both afoot and ahorse more frequent.  We crossed a stream and two roads, then came into a street with many houses which ran south, then, at four corners, turned sharp to the east. And there, across a little brook, we saw a handsome manor house around which some three score cavalry horses were picketed.  Yard, lawn, stables and barns were swarming with people--dragoons of Sheldon's Regiment, men of Colonel Thomas's foot regiment, militia officers, village gentlemen whose carriages stood waiting; and some of these same carriages must have come from a distance, perhaps even from Ridgefield, to judge by the mud and dust that clotted them.  Beyond the house, on a road which I afterward learned ran toward Lewisboro, between the Three Lakes, Cross Pond, and Bouton's, a military convoy was passing, raising a prodigious cloud of dust. I could see, and faintly hear, sheep and cattle; there was a far crack of whips, a shouting of drovers and teamsters, and, through the dust, we caught the sparkle of a bayonet here and there.  Somewhere, doubtless, some half starved brigade of ours was gnawing its nails and awaiting this same convoy; and I silently prayed God to lead it safely to its destination.  \"Pretty women everywhere!\" whispered Boyd in my ear. \"Our friend the Major seems to have a houseful. The devil take me if I leave this town tomorrow!\"  As we rode into the yard and dismounted, and our rifleman took the bridles, across the crowded roadway we could see a noble house with its front doors wide open and a group of ladies and children there and many gentlemen saluting them as they entered or left the house.  \"A respectable company,\" I heard Boyd mutter to himself, as he stood slapping the dust from hunting-shirt and leggings and smoothing the fringe. And, \"Damme, Loskiel,\" he said, \"we're like to cut a most contemptible figure among such grand folk--what with our leather breeches, and saddle-reek for the only musk we wear. Lord! But yonder stands a handsome girl--and my condition mortifies me so that I could slink off to the mews for shame and lie on straw with the hostlers.\"  There was, I knew, something genuine in his pretense of hurt vanity, even under the merry mask he wore; but I only laughed.  A great many people moved about, many, I could see, having arrived from the distant country; and there was a great noise of hammering, too, from a meadow below, where, a soldier told us, they were erecting barracks for Sheldon's and for other troops shortly expected.  \"There is even talk of a fort for the ridge yonder,\" he said. \"One may see the Sound from there.\"  We glanced up at the ridge, then gazed curiously around, and finally walked down along the stone wall to a pasture. Here, where they were building the barracks, there had been a camp; and the place was still smelling stale enough. Tents were now being loaded on ox wagons; and a company of Colonel Thomas's regiment was filing out along the road after the convoy which we had seen moving through the dust toward Lewisboro.  People stood about looking on; some poked at the embers of the smoky fires, some moused and prowled about to see what scrap they might pick up.  Boyd's roving gaze had been arrested by a little scene enacting just around the corner of the partly-erected barracks, where half a dozen soldiers had gathered around some camp-women, whose sullen attitude discouraged their gallantries. She was dressed in shabby finery. On her hair, which was powdered, she wore a jaunty chip hat tied under her chin with soiled blue ribbons, and a kerchief of ragged lace hid her bosom, pinned with a withered rose. The scene was sordid enough; and, indifferent, I gazed elsewhere.  \"A shilling to a penny they kiss her yet!\" he said to me presently, and for the second time I noticed the comedy--if you choose to call it so--for the wench was now struggling fiercely amid the laughing men.  \"A pound to a penny!\" repeated Boyd; \"Do you take me, Loskiel?\"  The next moment I had pushed in among them, forcing the hilarious circle to open; and I heard her quick, uneven breathing as I elbowed my way to her, and turned on the men good-humoredly.  \"Come, boys, be off!\" I said. \"Leave rough sport to the lower party. She's sobbing.\" I glanced at her. \"Why, she's but a child, after all! Can't you see, boys? Now, off with you all in a hurry!\"  There had evidently been some discipline drilled into Colonel Thomas's regiments the men seemed instantly to know me for an officer, whether by my dress or voice I know not, yet Morgan's rifle frock could be scarcely familiar to them.  A mischievous sergeant saluted me, grinning, saying it was but idle sport and no harm meant; and so, some laughing, others seeming to be ashamed, they made haste to clear out. I followed them, with a nod of reassurance to the wench, who might have been their drab for aught I knew, all camps being full of such poultry.  \"Gallantly done!\" exclaimed Boyd derisively, as I came slowly back to where he stood. \"But had I been fortunate enough to think of intervening, egad, I believe I would have claimed what she refused the rest, Loskiel!\"  \"From a ruddied camp drab?\" I asked scornfully.  \"Her cheeks and lips are not painted. I've discovered that,\" he insisted, staring back at her.  \"Lord!\" said I. \"Would you linger here making sheep's eyes at yonder ragged baggage? Come, sir, if you please.\"  \"I tell you, I would give a half year's pay to see her washed and clothed becomingly!\"  \"You never will,\" said I impatiently, and jogged his elbow to make him move. For he was ever a prey to strange and wayward fancies which hitherto I had only smiled at. But now, somehow--perhaps because there might have been some excuse for this one--perhaps because what a man rescues he will not willingly leave to another--even such a poor young thing as this plaything of the camp--for either of these reasons, or for none at all, this ogling of her did not please me.  Most unwillingly he yielded to the steady pressure of my elbow; and we moved on, he turning his handsome head continually. After a while he laughed.  \"Nevertheless,\" said he, \"there stands the rarest essence of real beauty I have ever seen, in lady born or beggar; and I am an ass to go my way and leave it for the next who passes.\"  I said nothing.  He grumbled for a while below his breath, then:  \"Yes, sir! Sheer beauty--by the roadside yonder--in ragged ribbons and a withered rose. Only--such Puritans as you perceive it not.\"  After a silence, and as we entered the gateway to the manor house:  \"I swear she wore no paint, Loskiel--whatever she is like enough to be.\"  \"Good heavens!\" said I. \"Are you brooding on her still?\"  Yet, I myself was thinking of her, too; and because of it a strange, slow anger was possessing me.  \"Thank God,\" thought I to myself, \"no woman of the common class could win a second glance from me. In which,\" I added with satisfaction, \"I am unlike most other men.\"  A Philistine thought the same, one day--if I remember right.    CHAPTER II  POUNDRIDGE  We now approached the door of the manor house, where we named ourselves to the sentry, who presently fetched an officer of Minute Men, who looked us over somewhat coldly.  \"You wish to see Major Lockwood?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" said Boyd, \"and you may say to him that we are come from headquarters express to speak with him on private business.\"  \"From whom in Albany do you come, sir?\"  \"Well, sir, if you must have it, from General Clinton,\" returned Boyd in a lower voice. \"But we would not wish it gossipped aloud.\"  The man seemed to be perplexed, but he went away again, leaving us standing in the crowded hall where officers, ladies of the family, and black servants were continually passing and repassing.  Very soon a door opened on our left, and we caught a glimpse of a handsome room full of officers and civilians, where maps were scattered in confusion over tables, chairs, and even on the floor. An officer in buff and blue came out of the room, glanced keenly at us, made a slight though courteous inclination, but instead of coming forward to greet us turned into another room on the right, which was a parlour.  Then the minute officer returned, directed us where to place our rifles, insisted firmly that we also leave under his care our war axes and the pistol which Boyd carried, and then ushered us into the parlour. And it occurred to me that the gentleman on whose head the British had set a price was very considerably inclined toward prudence.  Now this same gentleman, Major Lockwood, who had been seated behind a table when we entered the"]]]
