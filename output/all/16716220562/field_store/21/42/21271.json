Still, such was the fury of my ambition, such the untiring perseverance of my experiments, that, difficult of credit as it may be, in the course of one year I became theoretically and practically an accomplished microscopist.  During this period of my labors, in which I submitted specimens of every substance that came under my observation to the action of my lenses, I became a discoverer--in a small way, it is true, for I was very young, but still a discoverer. It was I who destroyed Ehrenberg's theory that the _Volvox globator_ was an animal, and proved that his \"monads\" with stomachs and eyes were merely phases of the formation of a vegetable cell, and were, when they reached their mature state, incapable of the act of conjugation, or any true generative act, without which no organism rising to any stage of life higher than vegetable can be said to be complete. It was I who resolved the singular problem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into ciliary attraction, in spite of the assertions of Mr. Wenham and others, that my explanation was the result of an optical illusion.  But notwithstanding these discoveries, laboriously and painfully made as they were, I felt horribly dissatisfied. At every step I found myself stopped by the imperfections of my instruments. Like all active microscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is a common complaint against many such, that they supply the defects of their instruments with the creations of their brains. I imagined depths beyond depths in nature which the limited power of my lenses prohibited me from exploring. I lay awake at night constructing imaginary microscopes of immeasurable power, with which I seemed to pierce through all the envelopes of matter down to its original atom. How I cursed those imperfect mediums which necessity through ignorance compelled me to use! How I longed to discover the secret of some perfect lens, whose magnifying power should be limited only by the resolvability of the object, and which at the same time should be free from spherical and chromatic aberrations, in short from all the obstacles over which the poor microscopist finds himself continually stumbling! I felt convinced that the simple microscope, composed of a single lens of such vast yet perfect power, was possible of construction. To attempt to bring the compound microscope up to such a pitch would have been commencing at the wrong end; this latter being simply a partially successful endeavor to remedy those very defects of the simple instrument, which, if conquered, would leave nothing to be desired.  It was in this mood of mind that I became a constructive microscopist. After another year passed in this new pursuit, experimenting on every imaginable substance--glass, gems, flints, crystals, artificial crystals formed of the alloy of various vitreous materials--in short, having constructed as many varieties of lenses as Argus had eyes, I found myself precisely where I started, with nothing gained save an extensive knowledge of glass-making. I was almost dead with despair. My parents were surprized at my apparent want of progress in my medical studies (I had not attended one lecture since my arrival in the city), and the expenses of my mad pursuit had been so great as to embarrass me very seriously.  I was in this frame of mind one day, experimenting in my laboratory on a small diamond--that stone, from its great refracting power, having always occupied my attention more than any other--when a young Frenchman, who lived on the floor above me, and who was in the habit of occasionally visiting me, entered the room.  I think that Jules Simon was a Jew. He had many traits of the Hebrew character: a love of jewelry, of dress, and of good living. There was something mysterious about him. He always had something to sell, and yet went into excellent society. When I say sell, I should perhaps have said peddle; for his operations were generally confined to the disposal of single articles--a picture, for instance, or a rare carving in ivory, or a pair of duelling-pistols, or the dress of a Mexican _caballero_. When I was first furnishing my rooms, he paid me a visit, which ended in my purchasing an antique silver lamp, which he assured me was a Cellini--it was handsome enough even for that--and some other knickknacks for my sitting-room. Why Simon should pursue this petty trade I never could imagine. He apparently had plenty of money, and had the _entr√©e_ of the best houses in the city--taking care, however, I suppose, to drive no bargains within the enchanted circle of the Upper Ten. I came at length to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask to cover some greater object, and even went so far as to believe my young acquaintance to be implicated in the slave-trade. That, however, was none of my affair.  On the present occasion, Simon entered my room in a state of considerable excitement.  \"_Ah! mon ami!_\" he cried, before I could even offer him the ordinary salutation, \"it has occurred to me to be the witness of the most astonishing things in the world. I promenade myself to the house of Madame--how does the little animal--_le renard_--name himself in the Latin?\"  \"Vulpes,\" I answered.  \"Ah! yes--Vulpes. I promenade myself to the house of Madame Vulpes.\"  \"The spirit medium?\"  \"Yes, the great medium. Great heavens! what a woman! I write on a slip of paper many of questions concerning affairs the most secret--affairs that conceal themselves in the abysses of my heart the most profound; and behold! by example! what occurs? This devil of a woman makes me replies the most truthful to all of them. She talks to me of things that I do not love to talk of to myself. What am I to think? I am fixed to the earth!\"  \"Am I to understand you, Monsieur Simon, that this Mrs. Vulpes replied to questions secretly written by you, which questions related to events known only to yourself?\"  \"Ah! more than that, more than that,\" he answered, with an air of some alarm. \"She related to me things----But,\" he added, after a pause, and suddenly changing his manner, \"why occupy ourselves with these follies? It was all the biology, without doubt. It goes without saying that it has not my credence.--But why are we here, _mon ami_? It has occurred to me to discover the most beautiful thing as you can imagine--a vase with green lizards on it, composed by the great Bernard Palissy. It is in my apartment; let us mount. I go to show it to you.\"  I followed Simon mechanically; but my thoughts were far from Palissy and his enameled ware, although I, like him, was seeking in the dark a great discovery. This casual mention of the spiritualist, Madame Vulpes, set me on a new track. What if this spiritualism should be really a great fact? What if, through communication with more subtile organisms than my own, I could reach at a single bound the goal, which perhaps a life of agonizing mental toil would never enable me to attain?  While purchasing the Palissy vase from my friend Simon, I was mentally arranging a visit to Madame Vulpes.   _3. The Spirit of Leeuwenhoek_  Two evenings after this, thanks to an arrangement by letter and the promise of an ample fee, I found Madame Vulpes awaiting me at her residence alone. She was a coarse-featured woman, with keen and rather cruel dark eyes, and an exceedingly sensual expression about her mouth and under jaw. She received me in perfect silence, in an apartment on the ground floor, very sparely furnished. In the center of the room, close to where Mrs. Vulpes sat, there was a common round mahogany table. If I had come for the purpose of sweeping her chimney, the woman could not have looked more indifferent to my appearance. There was no attempt to inspire the visitor with awe. Everything bore a simple and practical aspect. This intercourse with the spiritual world was evidently as familiar an occupation with Mrs. Vulpes as eating her dinner or riding in an omnibus.  \"You come for a communication, Mr. Linley?\" said the medium, in a dry, businesslike tone of voice.  \"By appointment--yes.\"  \"What sort of communication do you want?--a written one?\"  \"Yes--I wish for a written one.\"  \"From any particular spirit?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Have you ever known this spirit on this earth?\"  \"Never. He died long before I was born. I wish merely to obtain from him some information which he ought to be able to give better than any other.\"  \"Will you seat yourself at the table, Mr. Linley,\" said the medium, \"and place your hands upon it?\"  I obeyed--Mrs. Vulpes being seated opposite to me, with her hands also on the table. We remained thus for about a minute and a half, when a violent succession of raps came on the table, on the back of my chair, on the floor immediately under my feet, and even on the window-panes. Mrs. Vulpes smiled composedly.  \"They are very strong tonight,\" she remarked. \"You are fortunate.\" She then continued, \"Will the spirits communicate with this gentleman?\"  Vigorous affirmative.  \"Will the particular spirit he desires to speak with communicate?\"  A very confused rapping followed this question.  \"I know what they mean,\" said Mrs. Vulpes, addressing herself to me; \"they wish you to write down the name of the particular spirit that you desire to converse with. Is that so?\" she added, speaking to her invisible guests.  That it was so was evident from the numerous affirmatory responses. While this was going on, I tore a slip from my pocket-book, and scribbled a name, under the table.  \"Will this spirit communicate in writing with this gentleman?\" asked the medium once more.  After a moment's pause, her hand seemed to be seized with a violent tremor, shaking so forcibly that the table vibrated. She said that a spirit had seized her hand and would write. I handed her some sheets of paper that were on the table, and a pencil. The latter she held loosely in her hand, which presently began to move over the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50332"],["title","The Diamond Lens (#2)"],["body","with a singular and seemingly involuntary motion. After a few moments had elapsed, she handed me the paper, on which I found written, in a large, uncultivated hand, the words:       He is not here, but has been sent for.  A pause of a minute or so now ensued, during which Mrs. Vulpes remained perfectly silent, but the raps continued at regular intervals. When the short period I mention had elapsed, the hand of the medium was again seized with its convulsive tremor, and she wrote, under this strange influence, a few words on the paper, which she handed to me. They were as follows:       I am here. Question me.                  LEEUWENHOEK.  I was astounded. The name was identical with that I had written beneath the table, and carefully kept concealed. Neither was it at all probable that an uncultivated woman like Mrs. Vulpes should know even the name of the great father of microscopics. It may have been biology; but this theory was soon doomed to be destroyed. I wrote on my slip--still concealing it from Mrs. Vulpes--a series of questions, which, to avoid tediousness, I shall place with the responses, in the order in which they occurred:      I.--Can the microscope be brought to perfection?      SPIRIT.--Yes.      I.--Am I destined to accomplish this great task?      SPIRIT.--You are.      I.--I wish to know how to proceed to attain this end. For the love     which you bear to science, help me!      SPIRIT.--A diamond of one hundred and forty carats, submitted to     electro-magnetic currents for a long period, will experience a     rearrangement of its atoms _inter se_, and from that stone you will     form the universal lens.      I.--Will great discoveries result from the use of such a lens?      SPIRIT.--So great that all that has gone before is as nothing.      I.--But the refractive power of the diamond is so immense, that the     image will be formed within the lens. How is that difficulty to be     surmounted?      SPIRIT.--Pierce the lens through its axis, and the difficulty is     obviated. The image will be formed in the pierced space, which will     itself serve as a tube to look through. Now I am called.     Good-night.  I can not at all describe the effect that these extraordinary communications had upon me. I felt completely bewildered. No biological theory could account for the _discovery_ of the lens. The medium might, by means of biological _rapport_ with my mind, have gone so far as to read my questions, and reply to them coherently. But biology could not enable her to discover that magnetic currents would so alter the crystals of the diamond as to remedy its previous defects, and admit of its being polished into a perfect lens. Some such theory may have passed through my head, it is true; but if so, I had forgotten it. In my excited condition of mind there was no course left but to become a convert, and it was in a state of the most painful nervous exaltation that I left the medium's house that evening. She accompanied me to the door, hoping that I was satisfied. The raps followed us as we went through the hall, sounding on the balusters, the flooring, and even the lintels of the door. I hastily expressed my satisfaction, and escaped hurriedly into the cool night air. I walked home with but one thought possessing me--how to obtain a diamond of the immense size required. My entire means multiplied a hundred times over would have been inadequate to its purchase. Besides, such stones are rare, and become historical. I could find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.   _4. The Eye of Morning_  There was a light in Simon's room as I entered my house. A vague impulse urged me to visit him. As I opened the door of his sitting-room unannounced, he was bending, with his back toward me, over a carcel lamp, apparently engaged in minutely examining some object which he held in his hands. As I entered, he started suddenly, thrust his hand into his breast pocket, and turned to me with a face crimson with confusion.  \"What!\" I cried, \"poring over the miniature of some fair lady? Well, don't blush so much; I won't ask to see it.\"  Simon laughed awkwardly enough, but made none of the negative protestations usual on such occasions. He asked me to take a seat.  \"Simon,\" said I, \"I have just come from Madame Vulpes.\"  This time Simon turned as white as a sheet, and seemed stupefied, as if a sudden electric shock had smitten him. He babbled some incoherent words, and went hastily to a small closet where he usually kept his liquors. Although astonished at his emotion, I was too preoccupied with my own idea to pay much attention to anything else.  \"You say truly when you call Madame Vulpes a devil of a woman,\" I continued. \"Simon, she told me wonderful things tonight, or rather was the means of telling me wonderful things. Ah! if I could only get a diamond that weighed one hundred and forty carats!\"  Scarcely had the sigh with which I uttered this desire died upon my lips, when Simon, with the aspect of a wild beast, glared at me savagely, and, rushing to the mantelpiece, where some foreign weapons hung on the wall, caught up a Malay creese, and brandished it furiously before him.  \"No!\" he cried in French, into which he always broke when excited. \"No! you shall not have it! You are perfidious! You have consulted with that demon, and desire my treasure! But I shall die first! Me! I am brave! You can not make me fear!\"  All this, uttered in a loud voice trembling with excitement, astounded me. I saw at a glance that I had accidentally trodden upon the edges of Simon's secret, whatever it was. It was necessary to reassure him.  \"My dear Simon,\" I said, \"I am entirely at a loss to know what you mean. I went to Madame Vulpes to consult her on a scientific problem, to the solution of which I discovered that a diamond of the size I just mentioned was necessary. You were never alluded to during the evening, nor, so far as I was concerned, even thought of. What can be the meaning of this outburst? If you happen to have a set of valuable diamonds in your possession, you need fear nothing from me. The diamond which I require you could not possess; or, if you did possess it, you would not be living here.\"  Something in my tone must have completely reassured him; for his expression immediately changed to a sort of constrained merriment, combined, however, with a certain suspicious attention to my movements. He laughed, and said that I must bear with him; that he was at certain moments subject to a species of vertigo, which betrayed itself in incoherent speeches, and that the attacks passed off as rapidly as they came. He put his weapon aside while making this explanation, and endeavored, with some success, to assume a more cheerful air.  All this did not impose on me in the least. I was too much accustomed to analytical labors to be baffled by so flimsy a veil. I determined to probe the mystery to the bottom.  \"Simon,\" I said, gayly, \"let us forget all this over a bottle of Burgundy. I have a case of Lausseure's _Clos Vougeot_ downstairs, fragrant with the odors and ruddy with the sunlight of the C√¥te d'Or. Let us have up a couple of bottles. What say you?\"  \"With all my heart,\" answered Simon, smilingly.  I produced the wine and we seated ourselves to drink. It was of a famous vintage, that of 1848, a year when war and wine throve together--and its pure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed vitality to the system. By the time we had half finished the second bottle, Simon's head, which I knew was a weak one, had begun to yield, while I remained calm as ever, only that every draft seemed to send a flush of vigor through my limbs. Simon's utterance became more and more indistinct. He took to singing French _chansons_ of a not very moral tendency. I rose suddenly from the table just at the conclusion of one of those incoherent verses, and, fixing my eyes on him with a quiet smile, said: \"Simon, I have deceived you. I learned your secret this evening. You may as well be frank with me. Mrs. Vulpes, or rather one of her spirits, told me all.\"  He started with horror. His intoxication seemed for the moment to fade away, and he made a movement towards the weapon that he had a short time before laid down. I stopped him with my hand.  \"Monster,\" he cried, passionately, \"I am ruined! What shall I do? You shall never have it! I swear by my mother!\"  \"I don't want it,\" I said; \"rest secure, but be frank with me. Tell me all about it.\"  The drunkenness began to return. He protested with maudlin earnestness that I was entirely mistaken--that I was intoxicated; then asked me to swear eternal secrecy, and promised to disclose the mystery to me. I pledged myself, of course, to all. With an uneasy look in his eyes, and hands unsteady with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case from his breast and opened it. Heavens! How the mild lamplight was shivered into a thousand prismatic arrows, as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond that glittered in the case! I was no judge of diamonds, but I saw at a glance that this was a gem of rare size and purity. I looked at Simon with wonder, and--must I confess it?--with envy. How could he have obtained this treasure? In reply to my questions, I could just gather from his drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence was affected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in Brazil; that he had seen one of them secrete a diamond, but, instead of informing his employers, had quietly watched the negro until he saw him bury his treasure; that he had dug it up and fled with it, but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to dispose of it publicly--so valuable a gem being almost certain to attract too much attention to its owner's antecedents--and he had not been able to discover any of those obscure channels by which such matters are conveyed away safely. He added, that, in accordance with the Oriental practise, he had named his diamond"]]]
