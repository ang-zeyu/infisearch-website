And this is the testimony of Zenas H. Gurley given before he left the Church. Again, on the 3rd of January, 1846, the minutes say:      \"Zenas H. Gurley enlarged on the subject of liberally donating     to the Church necessities. God said He has so shaped the scheme     of salvation as that to be saved and appear approved of God, we     must sacrifice of all that we possess. * * He felt filled with the     Spirit. The course the Church is pursuing has been spoken of by     Jesus Christ and the holy prophets of olden time.\"  There is his endorsement of the course of the Church. And on January 10, 1846:      \"Zenas H. Gurley arose and said that the presidents of the quorum     had received their endowment.\"  Continuing he said--mark you, he was one of those presidents:      \"He observed that it was remarkable for an unusual outpouring of     the Holy Spirit. He felt for the quorum that they should receive     their endowment. The Church authorities, the quorum of Seventy in     succession, to furnish the people engaged in the endowment, one day     each, and he wanted the quorum (Twenty-first) to acquit themselves     from every obligation.\"  It may be interesting to know that this man and his wife were endowed in the Temple January 6, 1846. Here is the testimony of Zenas H. Gurley in relation to the Temple ceremonies when he was in full fellowship in the Church and was in possession of the spirit of his calling. At that time he declared most emphatically that on that occasion the Spirit of the Lord was unusual in its outpouring. If that is true and he could testify to it then, there cannot be anything so very bad in these glorious privileges of which he testified. In later years when he had lost the spirit of the Gospel and was fighting the work he had formerly upheld, he denounced in bitterness these sacred ordinances that he on this occasion sanctioned. His former testimony is the one that is consistent.  On the 17th of January, 1846, the minutes say:      \"President Zenas H. Gurley arose and said * * The business before     the meeting was the arranging for a donation for the benefit of     those of the Priesthood engaged in the Temple. (Not on the Temple     but in it). He beautifully observed that it was his design, and     also his council's to exalt the Twenty-first quorum, and the quorum     should reciprocally return the favor; give support and influence     towards its welfare.\"  Then on the 25th of the same month:      \"President Zenas H. Gurley arose and said that the business before     the meeting was to select persons to receive their endowment. He     had received direction to select 10 or 12 to go in the Temple. He     desired the brethren not to think it was partiality to make this     selection. The most important point to be considered was to learn     obedience. This was the principle taught by Jesus Christ.\"  He then proceeded to name the brethren for this purpose, and continuing his remarks he said:      \"The Saints who have passed through the trials of the Church were     generally rooted and grounded in love and have a witness in their     hearts or they would not have remained.\"  And I say amen to that. I wish with all my soul that Zenas H. Gurley had been one of them for his own sake, for it was but 10 days after he made this utterance, that the exodus from Nauvoo began, and this is the last reference we have of Zenas H. Gurley while connected with the Church! What became of him? \"Because he had no root he withered away.\" The terrible trials the Saints were forced to undergo in the wilderness were too great for him; he could not stand the test. And while he had declared that he would go with the Saints even if it required that he should sacrifice the wealth of the whole nation, when put to the actual test, his heart failed him and he sought safety in flight, he sought his life, but lost the life eternal!  The next reference we have of him in the minutes of the Twenty-first quorum is in 1855, where the statement is made that he had fled from the Church and was associated with James J. Strang. Of his connection with Mr. Strang, I prefer to read to you the account from the history of the \"Reorganized\" Church, for you know then we will have it correct. On page 744 of volume three we have the following:      \"After the death of Joseph Smith, Elder Gurley investigated the     claims of the various leaders, and finally accepted those of James     J. Strang as being the most reasonable. A letter written by him     from Gananoque, Canada West, November 6, 1849, and published in     Gospel Herald, volume 4, page 187, indicates that he was then on a     mission to Canada in the interest of the organization under Strang.     On January 1, 1850, he again wrote from Landsdown, Upper Canada,     still engaged in the same work.      \"A letter written January 10, 1850, from Pittsburg, Canada West,     manifested zeal in his work.\"  We have already shown how he manifested great zeal in his work in the Twenty-first quorum before he left the Church. But to continue:      \"March 15, 1850 he wrote from St. Lawrence, New York, that he was     assisting Brother Silsby in organizing the brethren and helping     them in getting ready for Beaver. He was present at a conference     held at Voree, Wisconsin, June 1 and 2, 1850, and in these minutes     we find this entry: 'Brother Z. H. Gurley was'--  Then there is an ellipsis, no doubt it would be interesting to know what follows, and the account continues--      'sent to the northeastern parts of Wisconsin, on the presentation     of President Strang.'\"  Now, please note carefully what follows:      \"It was probably while on the mission thus appointed that Elder     Gurley raised up the Yellowstone branch, the members of which     helped to form the nucleus of the Reorganization.\"--Page 744-5.  We have already seen that Jason W. Briggs raised up the Waukesha branch of the Strangite church in 1849, also that he raised up the Beloit branch for the same organization, and now we have the admission fatal to their organization, that the Yellowstone branch was also raised up to Mr. James J. Strang. These branches you see became the nucleus of the \"Reorganization.\" They were not connected with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to their own admission, but were organized for the Church of James J. Strang. Yet, mark you, these Strangite branches were admitted into what was called the \"New organization,\" or the \"Reorganization,\" on their original baptisms.[6] It is quite evident that the \"Reorganization\" is the offspring of the church of this man James J. Strang.  Now let us return to Jason W. Briggs. In Mr. Heman C. Smith's \"True Succession,\" pages 134-135, we have an alleged revelation that this man received that was the cause of the coming together of the so-called \"Reorganized\" Church. I have already told you that he was the most important man in this movement, if not the father of it. The \"revelation\" is as follows:      \"Therefore, let the elders whom I have ordained by the hand of my     servant Joseph, or by the hand of those ordained by him, resist not     this authority, nor faint in the discharge of duty, which is to     preach my gospel as revealed in the records of the Jews, and the     Book of Mormon, and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; and cry     repentance and remission of sins through obedience to the gospel,     and I will sustain them, and give them my Spirit; and in mine own     due time will I call upon the seed of Joseph Smith, and will bring     one forth, and he shall be mighty and strong, and he shall preside     over the High Priesthood of my Church; and then shall the quorums     assemble, and the pure in heart shall gather, and Zion shall be     reinhabited, as I said unto my servant Joseph Smith.\"   WHY BRIGGS SECEDED.  In this alleged revelation we have this man teaching lineal Priesthood or the right of succession from father to son. We also have him teaching the literal gathering to Zion of the honest in heart. We will now see what his reasons were for withdrawing from the \"Reorganized\" Church. We find on pages 248-249 of volume 33 of the Saints' Herald that the reasons why this man withdrew from the \"Reorganization\" with the family of Zenas H. Gurley, were as follows:  That he could not believe in:  (1) \"The literal gathering of the Church into Jackson and the adjoining counties in the state of Missouri (or any one or more places) known as a local Zion.\"  (2) \"Temple building and ceremonial endowments therein.\"  (3) \"Baptism for the dead.\"  (4) \"Tithing as a law applicable to the Church.\"  (5) \"The law of consecration by which individuals are made legal heirs to the Kingdom of Zion.\"  (6) \"A sole mouthpiece of God to the Church.\"  (7) \"The plenary inspiration of and consequent absolute authority of what are called the sacred books.\"  (8) \"The doctrine of 'cursing our enemies,' and of 'avenging God upon them to the third and fourth generations.'\"  (9) \"To the foregoing may be added the revelation of January 19, 1841, section 107 D. & C., (124 our edition), which enjoins upon the Church the building of a hotel, called the 'Lord's boarding-house,' for Joseph Smith and posterity to dwell in from generation to generation, as also the promise contained therein, viz: 'And as I said unto Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth, even so I say to my servant Joseph, in thee and thy seed shall the kindreds of the earth be blessed.\"  \"This coupled with the provisions in section 43, that 'none else should or could receive revelation for the Church' and the provision of section 19, that the Church shall receive Joseph's words and commands the same as if from God's own mouth,--establish in our judgment a lineal descent of authority, equivalent to an imperial dynasty, which is foreign to the spirit and genius of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],["title","Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#4)"],["body","of Christ.\"  This communication was dated March 28, 1886, and was signed by Jason W. Briggs, (president of their apostles); Zenas H. Gurley, (a member of that quorum); Gracie Gurley, Margaret Gurley, Edwin H. Gurley, Mida Gurley.  We see that this Mr. Briggs repudiated the fundamental portions of his alleged revelation. In the \"revelation\" he teaches the gathering, but here he says he does not believe in the gathering, either to Jackson county or to any other place to be known as a local Zion. In his \"revelation\" he teaches lineal Priesthood, but when he withdraws from the church one reason was that he could not believe in \"a sole mouth-piece of God to the Church,\" and in an \"imperial dynasty,\" which he erroneously thought was taught in the revelation. Thus he repudiates his \"revelation,\" denies the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and repudiates the standard works of the Church.[7] Unstable to the last, this man would not rest content in this organization which he was such a potent instrument in bringing into existence.[8]  There is another thing in his so-called \"revelation\" that is interesting. He declares that the Lord would raise up one of the seed of Joseph Smith who would be mighty and strong. Now, evidently this refers to Joseph Smith, president of that organization. Joseph Smith of the \"Reorganized\" Church declares that he is not the one mighty and strong and the \"Reorganized\" Church has backed him up by resolution in that conclusion.[9]   QUESTION OF REJECTION.  We now come to the question of the rejection of the Church. Our friends tell us that the Church was rejected for the reason that they failed to complete the Nauvoo Temple \"in the sufficient time granted by the Lord.\" They say that the Temple was not finished. The president of the \"Reorganization\" has made the following statement in this connection:      \"The basement was fitted for occupation and the baptismal font was     ready for use. The auditorium on the first floor was completed     sufficiently to be seated and occupied for assembly purposes. The     stairway on the south side was completed for use. The auditorium     on the second floor, the stairway on the north side, nor any other     portion of the building except those above named were completed;     though the small rooms above the second floor auditorium were used     by President Young and the resident Church authorities for various     purposes.\" (History of Reorganized Church, 2:562).  His brother Alexander makes a similar statement.  In reply to this it is only necessary to say that it made no difference whether the Temple was finished or not. The revelation of January 19, 1841, provided,      \"That when I (the Lord) give a commandment to any of the sons of     men, to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all     their might, and with all they have, to perform that work, and     cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them, and     hinder them from performing that work; behold, it behooveth me to     require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to     accept of their offerings:      \"And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and     commandments, I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my     work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent     not, and hate me, saith the Lord God.      \"Therefore for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those     whom I commanded to build up a city and a house unto my name, in     Jackson county, Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith     the Lord your God:      \"And I will answer judgment, wrath, and indignation, wailing and     anguish and gnashing of teeth upon their heads, unto the third and     fourth generation, so long as they repent not and hate me, saith     the Lord your God.      \"And this I make an example unto you for your consolation     concerning all those who have been commanded to do a work, and have     been hindered by the hands of their enemies, and by oppression     saith the Lord your God.\"[10]  No sane man will dare say that the Saints were not hindered by their enemies in the building of the Nauvoo Temple, both before and after the martyrdom. Nevertheless, I maintain that they were diligent in their labors as the following references will show, furthermore that the Temple was completed. In the Times and Seasons, volume 3, page 775, is to be found an editorial written by the Prophet Joseph in which he says:      \"This noble edifice is progressing with great rapidity; strenuous     exertions are being made on every hand to facilitate its erection;     and materials of all kinds are in great state of forwardness. * * *     *      \"While the busy multitudes have thus been engaged in their several     avocations, performing their daily labor, and working one-tenth of     their time, others have not been less forward in bringing in their     tithings and consecrations for the same great object. Never since     the formation of this Church was laid have we seen manifested a     greater willingness to comply with the requisitions of Jehovah; a     more ardent desire to do the will of God; more strenuous exertions     used, or greater sacrifices made, then there have been since the     Lord said: Let the Temple be built by the tithing of my people.     It seemed as though the spirit of enterprise, philanthropy, and     obedience rested simultaneously upon old and young; and brethren     and sisters, boys and girls, and even strangers, who were not     in the Church, united with an unprecedented liberality in the     accomplishment of this great work; nor could the widow in many     instances, be prevented, out of her scanty pittance, from throwing     in her two mites.\"  This was written in May, 1842. Remember the date, for I will have occasion to refer to this again before we are through.  This editorial reveals to us what is meant by laboring with your might and \"to cease not their diligence.\" The Lord did not require all the time of the Saints to be devoted on that building, but a tithing--one-tenth of their time or means. That is all He required of them in order that they should fulfill the commandment. This is also set forth in the second vol. of the Times and Seasons, page 567, and in vol., 3 pages 938-9, but I take it for granted that the reference given is sufficient to cover this ground.   TEMPLE BUILT BY SACRIFICE.  Let us here pause a moment and see what it took to build the Temple. That structure cost more than one million dollars; the Saints were poor, and a great deal of the time the Temple was in course of erection they were harassed by their enemies. The Prophet Joseph was forced into exile to avoid his enemies who tried to drag him to Missouri, and therefore he could not devote his personal attention to the building of the Temple as he otherwise would have done; and in this way the work was retarded to some degree by the enemies of the people. Moreover, the building of that structure was not like building one today. The Saints could not order their timber from the lumber yard in a state of preparation for the Temple. There were no iron foundries from which they could obtain the required metal properly prepared; but on the contrary, every detail had to be performed by the Saints. The timber had to be hewed in the far off forests of Wisconsin, carried to Nauvoo, and cut into boards and for the various uses of the Temple. The stone had to be cut and polished from the quarries, and the whole work had to be supplied out of the tithing of the people. If the Lord had required all of their time how would they have supported their families? Of course, He could have cared for them, but it was but the tenth, mark you, of their time and means that was required. And yet some of our friends complain that the Temple was not completed inside of six months! Naturally under these conditions it would take a number of years to complete the building.  We have seen that the Saints were diligent up to May, 1842.[11] Let us now see if they did not continue their diligence. Of course, there were some who were not diligent; but not of the faithful, not of those who followed the Twelve. At the April conference, 1844, the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, addressing the Saints, said:      \"I am one of the committee (i. e., Temple committee); the committee     tell me the quarry is blockaded, it is filled with rock, the stone     cutters are wanting work; come on with your teams as soon as     conference is over. It is not necessary for me to tell who will     come and do it; I will prophesy that you will do it. There is not     one in the city but that will do right if they know it, only one or     two exceptions, and they are not worth notice; God will take care     of them, and if He doesn't, the devil will.\" (T. & S., 5:597).  Now, I know that Hyrum Smith was a prophet of God, the Lord declared it, and his prophecy did not fail. This shows the willingness of the Saints to do this work as late as 1844.  In a communication to the Times and Seasons, October 13, 1844, signed \"C,\" we have the following:      \"The Temple is rising even faster than could have been anticipated,     and has a very imposing appearance.\"  Again on page 744, of volume 5, Times and Seasons, (December 15, 1844), this is stated:      \"The Temple has progressed with greater rapidity since the death of     Joseph and Hyrum than ever it had done before; and things in this     city never looked more prosperous.\"  And in an editorial in this same paper of May 15, 1845:      \"The Temple progresses rapidly and the Saints being united (as we     have heretofore said), are industrious, frugal and determined.\"  Then in the Times and Seasons, volume 6, page 926:      \"After a little more than four years of hard labor, in truly     troublesome times, and not, too, without the loss of the best blood     in the Church, on the morning of the 24th ult.
