MIME          [_Who has been staring at the Wanderer         open-mouthed, now shrinks back; aside, dejectedly._  Now how to get rid of the spy? The questions asked must be artful.          [_He summons up courage for an assumption of         sternness; aloud._      Thy head for thy     Lodging pays: 'Tis pawned; now seek to redeem it.     Three the questions     Thou shalt be asked.  WANDERER  Thrice then I must answer.  MIME [_Pulls himself together and reflects._      Since, far on the back     Of the wide earth roving, Thy feet have ranged o'er the world,     Come, answer me this:     Tell me what race Dwells in the earth's deep gorges.  WANDERER      In the depths of earth The Nibelungs have their home; Nibelheim is their land.     Black elves they all are;     Black Alberich Once was their ruler and lord.     He subdued the busy     Folk by a ring Gifted with magical might;     And they piled up     Shimmering gold,     Precious, fine-wrought, To win him the world and its glory.  Proceed with thy questions, dwarf.  MIME          [_Sinks into deeper and deeper meditation._      Thou knowest much,     Wanderer, Of the hidden depths of earth.     Now, answer me this:     Tell me what race Breathes on earth's back and moves there.  WANDERER      On the earth's broad back The race of the giants arose; Riesenheim is their land.     Fasolt and Fafner,     The rude folk's rulers, Envied the Nibelung's might.     So his wonderful hoard     They won for themselves, And with it gained the ring too.     The brothers quarrelled     About the ring,     And slain was Fasolt.     In dragon's form Fafner now watches the hoard.  One question threatens me still.  MIME [_Quite lost in thought._      Much, Wanderer,     Thou dost know Of the earth's back rude and rugged.     Now answer aright:     Tell me what race Dwells above in the clouds.  WANDERER      Above in the clouds     Dwell the Immortals; Walhall is their home.     They are light-spirits;     Light-Alberich, Wotan, rules as their lord.     From the world-ash-tree's     Holiest bough once Wotan made him a shaft.     Though the stem rot,     The spear shall endure,     And with that spear-point Wotan rules the world.     Trustworthy runes     Of holy treaties Deep in the shaft he cut.     Who wields the spear     Carried by Wotan     The haft of the world Holds in his hand.     Before him kneels     The Nibelung host;     The giants, tamed,     Bow to his will. All must obey, and for ever, The spear's eternal lord.          [_He strikes the ground with the spear as if by         accident, and a low growl of thunder is heard, by         which Mime is violently alarmed._  Confess now, cunning dwarf, Are not my answers right, And is not my head redeemed?  MIME          [_After attentively watching the Wanderer with the         spear, becomes very frightened, seeks in a confused         manner for his tools, and looks timidly aside._      Both thou hast won,     Wager and head; Thy way now, Wanderer, go.  WANDERER      Knowledge useful to thee     Thou wert to ask for; Forfeit my head if I failed.     Forfeit be thine,     Knowest thou not The thing it would serve thee to know.     Greeting thou     Gavest me not;     My head into thy hand     I gave That I might rest by thy hearth.     By wager fair     Forfeit thy head,     Canst thou not answer     Three things when asked; So sharpen well, Mime, thy wits!  [Illustration:    \"In dragon's form               Fafner now watches the hoard\"                            --See p. 21]  MIME          [_Very much frightened, and after much hesitation,         at last composes himself with timid submission._      Long it is     Since I left my land;     Long it seems to me     Since I was born. I saw here the eye of Wotan Shine, peering into my cave;     His glance dazes     My mother-wit. But well were it now to be wise. Come then, Wanderer, ask. Perhaps fortune will favour The dwarf, and redeem his head.  WANDERER [_Comfortably sitting down again._      Then first, honest dwarf,     Answer this question: Tell the name of the race That Wotan treats most harshly,          [_Very softly, but audibly._  And yet loves beyond all the rest.  MIME [_With more cheerfulness._      Though unlearnèd     In heroes' kinship, This question I answer with ease.     The Wälsungs are Wotan's     Chosen stock,     By him begotten     And loved with passion, Though they are shown no grace.     Siegmund and Sieglinde     Born were to Wälse,     A wild and desperate     Twin-born pair; Siegfried had they as son, The strongest shoot from the tree.     My head, say, is it     Still, Wanderer, mine?  WANDERER [_Pleasantly._      How well thou knowest     And namest the race! Rogue, I see thou art clever.     The foremost question     Thou hast solved; The second answer me, dwarf.     A crafty Niblung     Shelters Siegfried, Hoping he will slay Fafner, That the dwarf may be lord of the hoard, The ring being his.     Say, what sword,     If Fafner to fall is, Must be by Siegfried swung?  MIME          [_Forgetting his present situation more and more,         rubs his hands joyfully._      Nothung is     The name of the sword;     Into an ash-tree's stem     Wotan struck it; One only might bear it: He who could draw it forth.     The strongest heroes     Tried it and failed;     Only by Siegmund     Was it done; Well he fought with the sword Till on Wotan's spear it was split.     By a crafty smith     Are the fragments kept,     For he knows that alone     With the Wotan sword A brave and foolish boy, Siegfried, can slay the foe.          [_Much pleased._      A second time     My head have I saved?   [Illustration: Mime and the Wanderer. See p. 17]   WANDERER [_Laughing_.      The wisest of wise ones     Thou must be, surely; Who else could so clever be!     But wouldst thou by craft     Employ the boy-hero As instrument of thy purpose,     With one question more     I threaten thee.     Tell me, thou artful     Armourer, Whose skill from the doughty splinters Nothung the sword shall fashion.  MIME [_Starts up in great terror._      The splinters! The sword!     Alas! my head reels!     What shall I do?     What can I say?     Accursèd sword!     I was mad to steal it!     A perilous pass     It has brought me to.     Always too hard     To yield to my hammer!     Rivet, solder--     Useless are both.          [_He throws his tools about as if he had gone         crazy, and breaks out in utter despair._      The cleverest smith     Living has failed;     And, that being so,     Who shall succeed? How rede aright such a riddle?  WANDERER [_Has risen quietly from the hearth._  Three things thou wert to ask me; Thrice was I to reply.     Thy questions were     Of far-off things, But what stood here at thy hand-- Needed much--that was forgot,     Now that I guess it,     Thou goest crazed,     And won by me     Is the cunning one's head. Now, Fafner's dauntless subduer, Hear, thou death-doomed dwarf.     By him who knows not     How to fear Nothung shall be forged.          [_Mime stares at him; he turns to go._      So ward thy head     Well from to-day. I leave it forfeit to him Who has never learned to fear.

Mime has sunk on to the bench         overwhelmed._  MIME          [_Stares before him into the sunlit wood, and         begins to tremble more and more violently._      Accursèd light!     The air is on fire!     What flickers and flashes?     What buzzes and whirs?     What sways there and swings     And circles about?     What glitters and gleams     In the sun's hot glow?     What rustles and hums     And rings so loud?     With roll and roar     It crashes this way!     It bursts through the wood,     Making for me!          [_He rises up in terror._      Its jaws are wide open,     Eager for prey;     The dragon will catch me!     Fafner! Fafner!          [_He sinks shrieking behind the anvil._  SIEGFRIED          [_Behind the scenes, is heard breaking from the         thicket._      Ho there! Thou idler!     Is the work finished?          [_He enters the cave._  Quick, come show me the sword.          [_He pauses in surprise._      Where hides the smith?     Has he made off? Hey, there! Mime, thou coward! Where art thou? Where hidest thou?  MIME          [_In a small voice, from behind the anvil._      'Tis thou then, child?     Art thou alone?  SIEGFRIED [_Laughing._      Under the anvil? Why, what doest thou there? Wert thou grinding the sword?  MIME [_Comes forward, greatly upset and confused._      The sword? The sword?     How could I weld it?          [_Half aside._      By him who knows not     How to fear Nothung shall be forged.     Too wise am I     To attempt such work.  SIEGFRIED [_Violently._      Wilt thou speak plainly     Or must I help thee?  MIME [_As before._  Where shall I turn in my need?     My wily head     Wagered and lost is,          [_Staring before him._  And forfeit to him it will fall Who has never learned to fear.  SIEGFRIED [_Vehemently._      Dost thou by shuffling     Seek to escape?  MIME [_Gradually recovering himself._      Small need to fly     Him who knows fear! But that lesson was one never taught thee.     A fool, I forgot     The one great thing;     What thou wert taught     Was to love me, And alas! the task proved hard. Now how shall I teach thee to fear?  SIEGFRIED [_Seizes him._      Hey! Must I help thee?     What work hast thou done?  MIME      Concerned for thy good,     In thought I was sitting: Something of weight I would teach thee.  SIEGFRIED [_Laughing._      'Twas under the seat     That thou wert sitting; What weighty thing foundest thou there?  MIME          [_Recovering himself more and more._  Down there I learned how to fear, That I might teach thee, dullard.  SIEGFRIED [_With quiet wonder._      This fear then, what is it?

While I melt steel,     What art thou brewing?  MIME  A smith is put to shame, And learns from the lad he taught; All the master's lore is useless now; He serves the boy as cook. Steel thou dost brew into broth;     Old Mime boils thee     Eggs for thy meal.

[_During the following he takes the mould from the         fire, breaks it, and lays the glowing steel on the         anvil._      To find out what fear is     Forth he will guide me; A far-off teacher shall teach me;     Even what he does best     He cannot do well; In everything Mime must bungle!          [_During the forging._      Hoho! Hoho! Hohei!     Forge me, my hammer,     A trusty sword.     Hoho! Hahei!     Hoho! Hahei!

Now red thou comest     From the fire,     And thy softened steel     To the hammer yields. Angry sparks thou dost shower On me who humbled thy pride.     Heiaho! Heiaho!     Heiahohohohoho! Hahei! Hahei! Hahei! Hoho! Hoho! Hohei!     Forge me, my hammer,     A trusty sword!     Hoho! Hahei!     Hoho! Hahei!     How I rejoice     In the merry sparks!     The bold look best     When by anger stirred! Gay thou laughest to me, Grimly though thou dost pretend! Heiaho, haha, haheiaha!     Both heat and hammer     Served me well;     With sturdy strokes     I stretched thee straight; Now banish thy modest blush, Be as cold and hard as thou canst.     Heiho! "]]]
