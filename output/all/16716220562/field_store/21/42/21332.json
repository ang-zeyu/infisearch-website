The soft washing of the waves along the sides, the murmur of the wind through the light rigging aloft, and the occasional light footstep of the navigating officer on the bridge were the only sounds.  The long white vessel swept on through the night in silence. Here and there a light showed from some port-hole or window, but for the most part the whole boat was dark and silent. For once the yacht contained no merry party of guests to one-step on the wide decks and fill all the obscurer corners with accurately paired couples.  Alexander Morrison, millionaire steamship magnate, and his daughter Nita had the ship to themselves. They were sitting in two of the big wicker chairs on the after deck, and the glow of Morrison's cigar was the only light.  \"Getting chilly, Nita,\" he remarked casually. \"Are you warm enough?\"  \"Yes, indeed.\" Nita was silent for a moment, gazing off into the darkness. \"It's nice,\" she said reflectively, \"to be by one's self for a while. I'm glad you didn't invite a lot of people to come back with us.\"  Her father smiled.  \"Judging by the way you behaved along the Riviera,\" he reminded her, \"you didn't mind company. I never saw any one quite so run after as you were.\"  Nita shook her head.  \"They were running after you, daddy,\" she said lightly. \"I was just a means of approach.\"  Her father puffed on his cigar for a moment in silence.  \"It is a disadvantage, having a millionaire for a father,\" he admitted. \"It's hard to tell who is in love with you, and who is in love with your father's money.\"  \"So the thing to do, I suppose,\" said Nita amusedly, \"is just to fall in love with some one yourself, and pay no attention to his motives.\"  \"Where do you get your notions?\" asked her father. \"That's cynicism. You haven't been practicing on that theory, have you?\"  \"Not I,\" said Nita with a little silvery laugh. \"But you know, daddy, it isn't nice to feel like a money bag with a lot of people looking at you all the time, some of them enviously and some of them covetously, but none of them regarding you just like a human being.\"  \"I don't see,\" declared her father, with real affection, \"how any normal young man who looked at you could stop thinking about you long enough to think about your money.\"  \"I rise and bow,\" said Nita mischievously. \"May I return the compliment, substituting 'young woman' for 'young man'?\"  \"Don't try to fool your father,\" that gentleman said with a smile. He added with something of conscious pride: \"I don't suppose there are two other men in America as homely as I am.\"  \"Daddy!\" protested Nita, laughing. \"You're lovely to look at! I wouldn't have you look a bit different for worlds.\"  \"Neither would I have myself look different,\" her father admitted cheerfully. \"I've gotten used to myself this way. I like to look at myself this way. It's an acquired taste like olives, but once you learn to like me this way--why, there you are.\"  Nita laughed and was silent. Suddenly she began to look a little bit puzzled.  \"Do you notice anything funny?\" she asked in a moment or so. \"Somehow, the boat doesn't seem to be traveling just right.\"  Her father listened. Only the usual sounds came to his ears. The washing of the waves along the sides, however, had a peculiar timbre. Then he noticed that the boat seemed to be checking a little in its speed. There was an odd, velvety quality in the checking, very much like the soft breaking effect felt when a motor boat runs into a patch of weed.  \"Queer,\" said Morrison. \"We'll ask the captain.\"  The two of them walked down the deck arm in arm until they came to the stair ladder leading up to the bridge. The gentle checking continued. The boat seemed to be gradually slowing up, though the engines throbbed on as before.  \"What's the matter, captain?\" asked Morrison.  His first mate answered:  \"I've sent for the captain, sir. Our speed has fallen off three knots in the past five minutes.\"  The captain came hastily up on the bridge, buttoning up his coat as he came.  \"What's the matter, Mr. Harrison?\"  The first mate turned a worried face to him.  \"Our speed has dropped off three knots in five minutes, sir, and seems to be still slackening. I thought it best to send for you.\"  The captain called up the engine room.  \"All right down there?\"  \"Per-rhaps,\" came the answer in a thick Scotch burr. \"Ah was aboot to ask ye the same mysel'. We're usin' twenty perr cent more steam for the same number of rrevolutions.\"  \"We might have run into a big patch of seaweed,\" suggested the first mate.  \"Unship the searchlight,\" said the captain crisply.  A seaman came up to the bridge. He had been sent back to look at the patent log.  \"We're logging eight knots now, sir.\"  The first mate uttered an exclamation.  \"That's six knots off what we were making ten minutes ago!\"  No one spoke for a moment or so, while one or two seamen worked at the lashing of the cover on the searchlight.  \"Do any of you smell anything?\" asked Nita suddenly.  A faint but distinct odor came to their nostrils. It was the odor of slime and mud, with a tinge of musk. It was the scent of foul things from the water. It was a damp and humid smell, indistinctly musklike and disgusting.  \"Like deep-sea mud,\" said one of the seamen to the other. \"Like somethin' come up from Gawd knows what soundin'.\"  Nita gasped a little. The searchlight sputtered and then a long, white pencil of light shot out over the water. It wavered, and sank to a point just beside the bow of the boat. It showed--nothing.  The bow wave rose reluctantly and traveled but a little distance before it subsided into level sea. There were no waves. The water was calm as an inland lake.  \"No seaweed there,\" said the captain sharply. \"Look on the other side.\"  The searchlight swept across the deck and to the water on the other side. Nothing. The water seemed to be turgidly white, but that was all. It was not clear; it was rather muddy and almost milklike, as if a little finely divided chalk had been stirred in it. There was no disturbance of its placid surface. Only the reluctant bow wave surged away from the sharp prow of the yacht.  The seaman returned from a second trip to the patent log.  \"We're logging five knots now, sir.\"  \"Nine knots off,\" said the first mate with a white face. \"We were making fourteen.\"  \"We'll take a look all around,\" said the captain sharply.  The searchlight obediently swept the surface of the water. Every one on the bridge followed its exploring beam with anxious eyes. That musky, musty smell of things from unthinkable depths and the mysterious retardation of their vessel filled them with apprehension.  There was not one of them, from the ignorant seamen to the supereducated Morrison, who did not look fearfully where the light beam went.  The hand laid on the vessel--that in a calm sea had slowed from fourteen knots to five, despite the mighty engines within the hull--that force seemed of such malignant power that none of them would have been greatly surprised to see the huge bulk of some fabled Kraken rearing itself above the water, preparing to engulf the yacht with a sweep of some colossal tentacle.  The sea was calm. As far as the searchlight could light up its surface not a wave broke its calm placidity.  The seaman returned from his third visit to the patent log.  \"Two knots, sir!\"  The movement of the yacht became slower and slower as it gradually checked in its sweep through the water. The throbbing of the engines grew louder as they labored with increasing effort to master the mysterious Thing that was holding them back.  The boat was barely creeping now. It seemed to be struggling against some invisible force that gripped gently but relentlessly, some infinitely patient force that from the very patience of its operation was the more evidently inexorable.  The engines were working in panic-stricken tempo now. The chief engineer had given them all the steam they would take, and the propellers thrashed the water mightily, but the ship slowed, slowed.  At last it was still, while the engines seemed to be trying to rack themselves to pieces in their terrific attempt to drive the ship against the Thing that held it back.  The captain watched with a set face, then ordered the engines reversed. There was an instant's pause, and the propellers took up their thrashing of the water again. For a moment it seemed that they would have some effect. The yacht shivered and moved slightly backward, but then stopped again with the same soft gentleness.  The seamen inspected the water all around the ship with lanterns lowered to the water's edge. They found nothing. A sounding line was thrown overboard, and sank for two hundred fathoms without reaching bottom.  The searchlight played endlessly over the water, trying to find some turmoil that might indicate the presence of a monster whose tentacles had fastened upon the ship, but without result. The surface of the water was like glass.  Again and again the engines struggled mightily to move the ship. Again and again the propellers beat the water at the stern into froth and foam, but never did the yacht move by as much as an inch.  The sea was calm and placid. The stars looked down from the moonless sky and were reflected by the still surface of the water.  The yacht struggled like a living thing to break free from the mysterious force that held her fast, while all about her there hung that faintly disgusting odor of slime from the depths of the sea, an indistinctly musky odor as of something unclean.  At last the wireless began to crackle a frantic appeal for help, giving the details of what was happening on board the yacht. Hardly had the message finished when the yacht began to rock slightly, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50622"],["title","The Silver Menace (#1)"],["body","a faint ground swell.     II.   \"But, Theodore, old pet,\" said Davis amiably. \"The fact that a plane won't loop the loop or make nose dives at ninety degrees doesn't make it hopeless as a battleplane.\"  He was affectionately expounding the good points of a monster seaplane drawn up in its hangar by the beach.  Davis wore the insignia of a flight commander of the aviation corps and the ribbons of half a dozen orders bestowed on him after the destruction of the Black Flyer, destroyed by Teddy Gerrod and himself some six months before.  Teddy Gerrod was in civilian clothes, but was earnestly, though cheerfully, disputing everything his friend said.  \"A two-seater like the one we used six months ago,\" he pointed out, \"could fly rings around this bus of yours, and with a decent shot at the machine gun could smash it in no time.\"  \"Fly rings around it? Not noticeably,\" said Davis confidently. \"Since our idea of platinum plating the cylinders everybody's doing it. Using picro gasoline, as you and I did, we get a hundred and eighty miles an hour from this 'bus' you're trying to disparage. And, furthermore, if you try to damage this particular ship with machine-gun bullets you're going to be disappointed.\"  \"Armor?\"  \"Precisely. I admit cheerfully that you may know a lot about physics and cold bombs and liquid gases and such things, but when it comes to flying machines--my dear chap, you simply aren't there.\"  Gerrod laughed.  \"Perhaps not. But I'd rather dance around in a more lively fashion in a little two-seater.\"  \"And privately,\" admitted Davis, \"so would I. The next war we have I'm going to arrange for you to be my machine gunner.\"  \"Delighted,\" said Gerrod. \"But what would Evelyn say?\"  He was referring to his wife. Davis waved his hand.  \"Oh, she'd say there aren't going to be any more wars.\"  \"That reminds me,\" said Gerrod. \"We want you down for the next weekend. No other guests.\"  Davis nodded abstractedly. A messenger was coming over to the hangar at double time.  \"Thanks. I'll be glad to come. Wonder what this chap wants?\"  The messenger came up, saluted, and handed Davis a yellow slip. Davis tore it open and read:      Steam yacht _Marisposita_, Alexander Morrison of New York, owner,     reports position 33°11'N 55°10'W, wants immediate assistance.     Engines and hull perfect condition, not aground, no derelict or     obstacle discoverable. Unable to move any direction. Sea calm. Only     possible explanation has been seized by sea monster. Flt. Comm.     Richard Davis ordered to make reconnaissance of situation in     seaplane. Reported condition considered incredible, but no naval     vessels in immediate vicinity. Flt. Comm. Richard Davis will make     immediate investigation and report.  Davis whistled.  \"Here's something pretty!\" he remarked. \"Take a look.\"  He handed the order to Gerrod and went quickly to the door leading into the workshop attached to the hangar.  In a few crisp sentences he had ordered the big plane prepared for an extended flight, with provisions and as much fuel as it would carry. He returned to find Gerrod thinking busily.  \"May I come along on this trip?\"  \"It's against regulations, of course,\" said Davis, \"but no one will kick if _you_ go. You're privileged.\"  He cried an order or so at the workmen, who were now swarming over the machine.  Although the wireless message had been sent from the yacht after nightfall, the sun was barely setting on the coast, where the hangar was placed.  The vessel in distress was some thirty degrees east of the coast, and consequently the sun set two hours before it sank on the coastal line.  Gerrod phoned a hasty message to his wife and went to Davis' quarters, where he borrowed heavy flying clothes from Davis' wardrobe. The mechanics and helpers worked with desperate haste.  The aëroplane would be flying all night long, but it was desirable that it take off while there was yet some light. The long fuel tank was filled, and the motors run some ten or fifteen minutes, while critical ears listened for the faintest irregularity in their bellowing roar.  Two engineers and a junior pilot were to go with Davis in the big aircraft, and they were hastily summoned and told to prepare to leave in as short a time as possible.  It was hardly more than half an hour from the time the telegraphed order was received before Gerrod preceded Davis up the ladder and into the inclosed cabin of the seaplane.  The motors were cranked--two men tugging at the blade of each of the huge propellers--and the plane slid slowly down the ways and into the water.  Davis maneuvered carefully until he was clear of all possible entanglements. Then he gave the motors more gas and more. Their harsh bellow rose to a deafening sound, and the long, boatlike body began to surge through the waves with gradually increasing speed.  For a few yards the spray blew upon and spattered the glass windows of the cabin. Then the planes began to exert their lifting power and the plane began to ride the waves instead of plowing through them.  The speed increased again, and suddenly the shocks of the waves beating on its under surface ceased. The plane rode upon air with a smooth and velvety motion that was sure and firm.  Davis rose gradually to five thousand feet and headed accurately to the east. A southerly wind, reported by wireless from a ship at sea, would carry him slightly to the south, and the sum of the two motions should bring him, by dawn, very close to the spot from which the yacht had sent out her wireless call.  Davis was not pushing the plane to its utmost. He would need light by which to descend, and had no intention of reaching the spot where the _Marisposita_ was in distress until dawn.  From their altitude the ocean seemed only a dark, unfathomable mass below them. The stars twinkled down from the arch of the sky in all their myriads of sizes and tints.  There was no moon. Those in the closed car of the big seaplane could only see the star-strewn firmament above them and upon all sides, which sank down, and abruptly was not.  Save for the cessation of the star clusters, the horizon was invisible. The sea was obscure and mysterious, like some mighty chasm over which they flew precariously.  The dark wings of the plane stretched out from the sides of the body with a mighty sweep. The plane was over a hundred feet across, and with the powerful motors it possessed was capable of lifting an immense weight. Even now more than two tons of fuel were contained in the huge tanks in the tail.  Davis drove steadily on through the night for a long time. His face was intent and keen. He made little or no attempt to look out of the windows before him.  His eyes were fixed almost continuously upon the instruments before him: the altometer, which was a barometer graduated to read in feet and with means for correcting the indication by barometric readings from sea level; the inclinometer, which showed the angle at which the plane was traveling with regard to the earth's surface, and the compass.  The compass was one of the very latest developments of the gyroscopic compass and showed the true north without regard for magnetic deviations.  Davis felt out his machine thoroughly and then turned it over to his junior pilot. The younger man--and to be younger than Davis meant that he was very young indeed--slipped into the driver's seat, quickly ascertained the course, speed, and altitude, and settled back to continue Davis' task, while Davis curled himself up in a chair and went instantly to sleep.  It was chilly in the car, but Davis slept the sleep of the just, ignoring the roaring of the motors outside, which was only slightly muffled by the windows of the car.  Gerrod had gone to sleep some time before, and one of the two engineers was similarly curled up on the floor of the roomy and comfortable car.  Hours passed, while the big seaplane winged its way steadily through the night. It roared its way across the vast chasm of the dark ocean below, an incarnation of energy at which the placid stars looked down in mild surprise.  The exhausts roared continuously, the stays hummed musically, and the great wings cut through the air with resistless force.  Within the dark body of the plane three men slept peacefully, one sat up sleepily, listening to the motors, and prepared to wake into alertness at the slightest sign of irregularity in the action of any of them, and one man sat quietly at the controls, his eyes fixed on the instruments before him, lighted by tiny, hooded electric bulbs.  Course, due east. Altitude, five thousand feet. Speed, one hundred and fifteen miles. Twice during the night Davis woke and made sure that all was well.  In leaving the navigation of the machine to his assistant, he was not throwing the major part of the work on him. The work would come in the morning, when they found the yacht.  If there were anything in the talk of a sea monster having seized the yacht, Davis would need to be fresh for the search and possible battle that would follow.  He was taking the most sensible precaution possible. And, in any event, he had driven for the first four hours, during which the younger man had rested.  The first gray light began to appear in the east. The pilot of the plane had not looked away from his instruments for an hour, and not until a faint light outside called his attention to the approach of dawn did he think to glance through the windows.  A dimly white glow was showing as an irregular splotch toward the east. The pilot saw it and noticed something odd about its appearance, but did not stop to examine it closely.  He called Davis, as he had been ordered to do. Davis sat up, rubbed his eyes, and was thoroughly awake.  \"All right?\" he asked.  The pilot nodded.  \"Sunrise,\" he said. \"You said to call you.\"  \"Right you are.\" Davis stood up and stretched his muscles. \"Here, Teddy, wake up.\"  Gerrod stirred, and in a moment was awake. Davis deftly prepared coffee and"]]]
