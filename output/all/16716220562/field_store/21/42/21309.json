Now, in brief, these were the conditions at the time, and is it any wonder that unwise and even harsh things were said? The wonder is that the people bore it as patiently as they did. The officers were non-\"Mormons,\" the Territory was under Federal control and contained many Gentiles, many of whom were most bitter in their feelings and ever ready to accuse the Saints of crime. The government was strong enough to enforce the law if broken. Now, I ask you if you believe the horrors, as they have been pictured, could have existed under such conditions?  Such a state of affairs would have been a reproach and a shame to the American government. And no such state of affairs existed.  The conditions at the time led Jacob Forney, superintendent of Indian affairs in Utah, to declare in 1869:      I fear, and I regret to say it, that with certain parties here     there is a greater anxiety to connect Brigham Young and other     Church dignitaries with every criminal offense than dilgent     endeavor to punish the actual perpetrators of crime.      Bancroft's History of Utah, p. 561.      Whitney's History of Utah, p. 108, vol. 1.  Mr. Forney was a Gentile official and the truth of this statement can be relied upon.  This being the case, Brigham Young and the \"Mormon\" people could not have engaged in the crimes charged against them.  In connection with this let me quote from Bancroft:      It is not true that Mormons are not good citizens, lawabiding     and patriotic. Even when hunted down, and robbed and butchered     by the enemies to their faith, they have not retaliated. On this     score they are naturally very sore. When deprived of those sacred     rights given to them in common with all American citizens, when     disfranchised, their homes broken up, their families scattered,     their husband and father seized, fined and imprisoned, they have     not defended themselves by violence but have left their cause to     God and their country.--History of Utah, pp. 390-392.  Again, I repeat, that the presence in Utah of apostates and anti-\"Mormons\" from the beginning and \"that there are men living in Utah today who left the Church in the earliest history of our State, who feel as secure and are just as secure and free from molestation from their former associates as you or any other man could be,\" proves the falseness of the malicious accusation that \"Utah was for years a land of assassination and a field of blood.\"   MR. EVANS' FALSE QUOTATIONS      \"What shall be done with the sheep that stink the flock so? We will     take them, I was going to say, and cut off their tails two inches     behind their ears; however I will use a milder term, and say cut     off their ears.\"  Your conclusion is most certainly far fetched. Had you continued the quotation your attempt would have appeared even more ridiculous. The next sentence is:      \"But instead of doing this, we will try to cleanse them; and will     wash them with soap; that will come nigh taking off the skin; we     will then apply a little Scotch snuff, and a little tobacco, and     wash them again until we make them clean.\"  And you try to make this appear as threatening life! It is apparent that your sense of humor has been sadly neglected. This whole passage is humorous and you make yourself ridiculous by not having discovered it.  Again from Parley P. Pratt, you quote:      \"My feelings are with those who have spoken, decidedly and firmly     so.\"  This from page 84. Then you skip to page 86 and add:      \"I need not repeat their doom, it has been told here today, they     have been faithfully warned.\"  Then three paragraphs off, the following:      \"It is too late in the day for us to stop and inquire whether such     an outcast has the truth.\"  This method of proving things reminds me of the reason why you should be hanged:      And Judas \"went out and hanged himself.\"      \"Go thou and do likewise.\"  Now let me quote some extracts from this discourse which you purposely left out.      \"Sooner than be subjected to a repetition of these wrongs, _I     for one_, would rather march out today and be shot down. These     are my feelings, and have been for some time. Talk about liberty     of conscience! Have not men liberty of conscience here? Yes. The     Presbyterian, Methodists, Quakers, etc., have _here_ the liberty to     worship God in their own way, and so has every man in the world.     People have the privilege of apostatizing from this Church and     worshiping devils, snakes, toads, or geese, if they please, and     only let their neighbors alone. But they have not the privilege     to disturb the peace, nor to endanger life or liberty; that is     the idea. If they will take that privilege, _I need not repeat     their doom, it has been told here today, they have been faithfully     warned_.\"  Again:      \"He (Gladden Bishop) was disfellowshiped, and received on his     professions of repentance, so often, that the Church at length     refused to admit him any more as a member. These apostates talk of     proof. Have we not proved Joseph Smith to be a prophet, a restorer,     standing at the head of this dispensation? Have we not proved the     priesthood which he placed upon others by the command of God?      \"I see no ground, then, to prove or to investigate the calling of     an apostate, who has always been trying to impose upon this people.     _It is too late in the day for us to stop and inquire whether such     an outcast has the truth_.      \"We have truths already developed, unfulfilled by us--unacted upon.     There are more truths poured out from the eternal fountain, already     than our minds can contain, or that we have places or preparations     to carry out. And yet we are called upon to prove--what? _Whether     an egg that was known to be rotten fifteen years ago, has really     improved by reason of age_!      \"'_You are going to be destroyed_,' say they. '_Destruction awaits     this city_.' Well! what if we are? We are as able to be destroyed     as any people living. What care we whether we are destroyed or not?     These old tabernacles will die of themselves, if left alone.      \"We have nothing to fear on that head, for we are as well prepared     to die as to live. One thing we have heard today, and I am glad     to hear it. We shall not be destroyed in the old way--as we have     been heretofore. We shall have a change in the manner, at least.     We shall probably be destroyed _standing, this time_, and not in     a _sitting_, or _lying position_. We can die as well as others     who are not as well prepared! I am glad that while we do live we     shall not submit to be yoked or saddled like a dumb ass. We shall     not stand still to see men, women, and children murdered, robbed,     plundered, and driven any more, as in the States heretofore. Nor     does God require it at our hands. That is the best news we have     heard today. * * *      \"It is the policy not to wait till you are killed, but act on     the defensive while you still live. I have said enough on this     subject.\"--pp. 86-87.  The vicious malignancy of a depraved mind is made so apparent in this contrast between your garbled quotations and the whole truth, that it scarcely deserves further comment.  I have quoted quite extensively in order to show the reason for these remarks of which you quote such brief and disjointed extracts. You should remember that the Saints had but a short time before being driven from their homes at the cannon's mouth, and were forced to traverse a desert under the most trying circumstances to find a new abode where they could rest in peace and call their souls their own. When followed, as they were, by a miserable class that were determined to again have them driven, where heaven only knows, in their might and righteous indignation they firmly took their stand for home and liberty. I for one, say that they were justified in this course, the protection of their liberty, honor and lives. Had the threats of their enemies here in Utah been carried out as they boasted that they would be, and as they were carried out in Missouri and Illinois, then Brigham Young and his people would have been as thoroughly justified in unsheathing the bowie knife, to conquer or die, as were the patriots at Lexington and Bunker Hill!  Home and liberty and life, with the right to worship God, are just as dear to a \"Mormon\" as to members of any other denomination or even an apostate \"Mormon,\" and when the \"Mormons\" are persecuted, driven and slain and forced to seek a home in the savage wilds, would any honest man blame them if they declined to move again?  Why is it worse for \"Utah Mormons\" to defend themselves than for \"Mormons\" at Crooked river and Nauvoo? Even the noble Prophet Joseph Smith, when dragged from home and persecuted by wicked men, solemnly demurred. Said he to the Saints at Nauvoo on the 30th day of June, 1843, after his escape from Missourian assassins:      \"Before I will be dragged away again among my enemies for trial,     _I will spill the last drop of blood in my veins and will see all     my enemies in hell_! To bear it any longer would be a sin, and I     will not bear it any longer. Shall we bear it any longer? (one     universal, No! ran through all the vast assembly like a loud peal     of thunder.) * * * If mobs come upon you any more here, dung your     gardens with them. We don't want any excitement; but after we have     done all, we will rise up Washington-like and break off the hellish     yoke that oppresses us, and will not be mobbed!\"  I have copied this from the manuscript history of the Prophet Joseph Smith, as it was recorded at the time. I have learned also that it is corroborated by the journal of Wilford Woodruff of the same date--June 30th, 1843.

WHITNEY  Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles   SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH 1914    PREFACE AND DEDICATION.  This little book was written and compiled at the request of the General Priesthood Committee, under the sanction of the First Presidency of the Church, for the use and benefit of the Priesthood Classes, throughout the Stakes and Wards of Zion.  The treatise, \"Gospel Themes,\" represents the best effort I could make under the circumstances in which that effort was put forth. Many interruptions occurred, consequent upon the performance of other duties, and I had no opportunity to submit the manuscript to a committee of revision, prior to publication; the usual course with works of this character. I was barely able to get it ready for the printer within the time allotted for its preparation. But I tried to be accurate, and am not aware that I made any mistakes.  While lacking the help of a revisory committee, I received, and hereby gratefully acknowledge, valuable suggestions from Elders David O. McKay and Edward H. Anderson, members of the Priesthood Committee, and from others whom I consulted. Moreover, Brother Anderson was with me in proof-reading the work, and in engineering it through the press.  My aim has been, not to give exhaustive treatment to any subject, but to throw in sight certain themes, and dwell briefly upon points of doctrine, prophecy, history, and illustration, that I thought would be helpful to the brethren of the Priesthood--those who are studying the Gospel at home, and those who are preaching it abroad. To both classes this volume is affectionately dedicated.                                                       THE AUTHOR.  Salt Lake City, Christmas, 1913.    CONTENTS.  THE STORY OF GOD.

The Story of God.  CHAPTER I.  A Divine Plan for Human Progress.  The Gospel Defined.--The English word \"Gospel\" comes from the Anglo-Saxon \"Godspell,\" or God-story--the story of God. It derives its significance from that great central idea of the Christian faith--the coming of God as the Son of God to redeem and save mankind. The joyful intelligence of the advent of the world's Redeemer, proclaimed by the angels to the shepherds on the Judean hills (Luke 2:10), furnishes another name for the gospel--\"good tidings,\" or, as it is otherwise rendered, \"glad tidings of great joy.\"  God the Savior.--\"God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people, and because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God\" (Mosiah 15:1,2). prediction by Abinadi the prophet, centuries before the birth of the Savior, had been preceded by a This similar prophecy from King Benjamin, another Nephite seer (Mosiah 3:5). The fulfilment of these foretellings is recorded in the opening verses of the gospel according to St. John, where reference is made to \"the Word\" that was in the beginning \"with God\"--the Word that \"was God,\" and was \"made flesh\" and dwelt among men. In him, as Paul affirms, \"dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily\" (Col. 2:9).  Foundation and Superstructure.--When we speak of the gospel, therefore, we should bear in mind that the term means something more than faith, repentance, baptism, the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and other rituals and requirements in the Church of Christ. We must not isolate \"the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" from the basic principles upon which they rest--the mighty foundation stones of sacrifice and redemption, without which all this sacred legislation would be aimless and of no effect. Nor can the basic principles which make operative those laws and ordinances be dissociated from the idea of eternal progression, the great and paramount purpose for which the gospel code was framed, the gospel in its fulness instituted.  Fulness of the Gospel.--The phrase, \"fulness of the gospel,\" should be understood in a relative sense, as pertaining to the revealed will of God. There can be no absolute fulness, with man, until all things are made known to him. The fulness of the gospel as delivered to the Nephites and other ancient peoples, and told of in the inspired records that have come down to us, differed from, in that it was not so complete as is the fulness of the gospel which the Latter-day Saints enjoy. Truth is always the same; it never contradicts itself; but more of its principles have been revealed in modern times than at any previous period. Never before, upon this earth, has there been such a gospel fulness as that delivered to the Prophet Joseph Smith. And the end is not yet; for, as he himself said in one of his latest recorded utterances: \"Those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this the dispensation of the fulness of times\" (D&C 128:18).  It may help the reader to understand how there can be more than one \"fulness of the gospel\" by bearing in mind what has been made known concerning the final judgment, or the various awards of glory to be meted out to redeemed souls after the resurrection. Their glory shall be that by which their bodies are quickened, and whether quickened by a portion of the celestial, the terrestrial, or the telestial glory, they shall \"receive of the same, even a fulness\" (D&C 88:28-31). But one fulness can differ from another, even as differ the glories, and even as capacities differ--the power to receive and contain. The absolute fulness of the gospel can only come to a people prepared to receive and make a wise use of it. Until the Latter-day Saints are in that condition, they must be content with a comparative fulness, or all that they can contain of the divine wisdom. Paul the apostle was contemplating this subject when he wrote: \"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away\" (1 Cor. 13:9,10).  Gospel Features.--The gospel, in its fullest sense, signifies everything connected with the redemptive career of that glorious and divine Being known among men as Jesus of Nazareth, but who was and is no other than Jehovah, the God of Israel (D&C 110:1-4), who \"came unto his own\" and was rejected by them, was crucified at their instigation, and died to redeem the world. The accounts given by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are properly termed \"gospels,\" because they are narratives of the personal ministry of our Lord; but they are only parts of the complete God-story. The Savior's life, death, resurrection and ascension, with the conditions prescribed by him upon which fallen man might profit further from his sacrifice for human redemption,--these are all gospel features, but not the gospel in its entirety. The full \"story\" of the Redeemer and Savior--the God who died that man might live--involves events both past and future, events premortal and post-mortal, scenes in which he was chosen to play his mighty part in the great tragedy of human experience, and scenes yet to come in which he will make another and a more glorious appearing upon the stage of time, enacting the illustrious role of King of kings and reigning over the earth a thousand years.  Salvation and Exaltation.--Paul defines the Gospel of Christ as \"the power of God unto salvation\" (Rom. 1:16). He might have gone further, had he so desired, or had it been timely, and shown that the Gospel of Christ is the power of God unto exaltation--a plan devised by Omnipotent Wisdom whereby man, the child of God, may advance from stage to stage of soul development, until eventually he becomes like unto his Heavenly Parent, inheriting eternal thrones and dominions, and receiving \"a fulness of joy.\"  This is exaltation. It is more than salvation, being an extension of that idea or condition--salvation \"added upon;\" just as salvation is an extension of, or an addition to, redemption. A soul may be redeemed--that is, raised from the dead, and yet condemned at the final judgment for evil deeds done in the body. Likewise may a soul be redeemed and saved, and yet come short of the glory that constitutes exaltation. To redeem, save, and glorify, is the threefold purpose of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Origin and Antiquity of the Gospel.--The gospel originated in the heavens, before this earth was organized, and was revealed to man, out of eternity, at the very beginning of time. It was the means by which Adam, our great ancestor, after his expulsion from Eden, regained the divine presence from which he had been banished. It is the means by which his posterity, such as are obedient to the"]]]
