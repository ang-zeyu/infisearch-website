Going down a hundred per second.\"  \"Let her down.\"  Anxious seconds of jockeying, Jon's eyes flashing from indicator to gauge to telltale to screen, his hands and feet moving here and there on the controls.  The two others gasped as they saw the ground rushing toward them so swiftly. The ship landed--but with a jar that shook them all.  \"Off bow retarders,\" Jak yelled.  The roar of the tubes ceased and they were almost stunned by the sudden silence.  \"Down landing props.\"  The grind of a motor, then a gentle jar and the ship seemed to straighten a bit.  \"Props down.\"  \"Close fuel petcocks.\"  \"Closed.\"  \"Shut off fuel pump.\"  \"Shut.\"  \"All controls in neutral.\"  Jon's hands flashed over several levers, knobs and switches.  \"Everything neutral.\" He turned in his seat then, and his face wore a wide grin of triumph. \"We did it. We're down.\"  He noticed his mother's white, strained face, and called to her, \"Relax, Mom. I set you down in one piece, just as I said I would.\"  Jak broke in with a scoffing comment--although his eyes showed the secret pride he felt in his younger brother's ability--\"Lousy landing. What's the big idea, jolting us all like that? Want to bust up the ship?\"  \"Now, Boys,\" their mother hastened to break up this incipient quarrel before it had the chance to get started--which was exactly what Jak intended--\"I think Jon did exceptionally well, considering it was his first solo landing. I'm not hurt at all, and I'm sure the ship isn't, either.\"  Jak pretended to look ashamed, although neither of the boys could completely hide their grins, and had to face away from her. \"Yes, I was just steaming off. It was really a swell job, Chubby.\"  But Jon had already pushed out of his seat and was at one of the window-ports, peering eagerly outside. However, he did fling back over his shoulder, \"You helped a lot, Owl. Couldn't have done it without you.\"  The other two came up quickly to stand beside him, staring at this strange, new world. The clearing in which the ship rested, they could see now, was about a hundred acres in extent. Near the ship the strange grass with which the clearing was carpeted was seared and black from their landing blasts, and burning in places. But toward the huge trees that walled the clearing, the grass was in its natural green state, covered with tiny, whitish blossoms.  The trees visible from the ship were mostly very tall, averaging well over three hundred feet, the Carvers estimated. They looked somewhat like Douglas firs, but with a difference the Terrans could not at the moment figure out.  The three could see no animal or bird life, but guessed this did not mean there was none. The jungle might be teeming with life, but it would probably have been frightened away for the time being by this strange, fire-breathing monster that had descended from the skies to land on their world.  \"Think it's safe to go out?\" Jak asked.  \"Now you listen to your mother, and don't take any chances.\"  \"We won't,\" Jon told her, then answered his brother. \"We'll wait an hour and see what we can see from here, then decide.\"  \"I sure want a closer look at that plant Life.\" Jak's eyes glistened, and he ran to get his binoculars to see better.  \"I ought to examine the hull and tubes, too, to make sure they aren't fouled or corroded,\" Jon told his mother.  \"It's nearly time for lunch.\" She turned away. \"At least you must stay in until after that.\" It was plain she was still worried, and the boys tried to reassure her and quiet her fears.  When she called they reluctantly left their vantage points at the ports and went in to eat the lunch she had prepared. Several times she had to caution them against bolting their food, as they talked eagerly of what they might find here.  Finally finished, Jon rose. \"Come on, Owl,\" he urged, \"let's go outside and give it the once-over lightly.\"  \"Better break out our rifles first,\" the elder advised. \"No telling what we'll run into.\"  \"If it's dangerous enough for guns, I wish you wouldn't go.\" Their mother was worried again.  \"They're just a precaution, same as Father would take if he was in charge,\" Jak soothed. \"We won't go out of this clearing this first time.\"  \"You'd better give Mr. C. another feeding first, hadn't you?\"  Jak consulted his wrist-chronom. \"Yes, it's nearly time, and we might not be back by the regular hour.\"  The problem of keeping their father fed and in good health, apart from his head and leg injuries, had not proven too hard when they became convinced that he was not going to wake up often enough to eat normally.  Jak, while working as orderly in the Centropolitan Hospital the previous summer, had assisted the interns and nurses in giving intravenous feedings to unconscious patients. So he knew the general procedure, as well as the composition and quantity of the nutrient liquid to be administered.  \"Will you come help me, Mother,\" he had asked when he was sure he was ready for that first feeding. \"We've got to find certain things in our food stores.\"  \"You're sure you know how to do it?\"  \"Yes, it's not hard. We need liquid proteins, salt, sugar and glucose.\" With his mother helping, he had gathered these from their stores, and taken them into the galley. There he had carefully measured out and mixed these ingredients in the proportions his books stated.  Then he and Jon had gone into the workshop and there the younger, under his brother's supervision, and with pictures of the apparatus as a guide, had rigged up a drip-regulator to go into the mouth of a large bottle. To this they had attached a long, slender, plastic tube, and to the far end of that a large, hollow feeding needle.  As the others watched anxiously, Jak had inserted the needle into the large vein on the inside of his father's left elbow. With his thumb Jak had softly rubbed the vein just above the needle's point, to assist the flow of the nutrient. Soon it was done. Mr. Carver had stirred and his eyelids had fluttered when the needle was inserted but he had not fully regained consciousness.  That first feeding so successfully accomplished, Mrs. Carver did not seem to worry quite so much about her husband, although she was careful to keep track of the feeding times, and to remind her sometimes forgetful son of his duty.  The feeding given this day, the boys consulted together.  \"Shall we wear our spacesuits?\" Jon asked.  \"I don't see why. It's hot outside, but bearable, and the air's all right,\" Jak answered positively. \"I not only tested it, but I breathed the sample I took in through the trap. It smells good, and hasn't hurt me any. We'll take our guns, and I want my magnifying glass and knapsack for specimens.\"  \"And I'll put some multiform tools in my belt. Then, in case there's anything that needs doing on the tubes or hull, I can do it quickly.\"  The two brothers assembled their gear and Jon was just reaching for the button to open the inner door when they stopped short and shrank back.  For a terrific roar came from outside ... such a tremendous sound it penetrated even the hull of their ship!     3   At that horrid noise, the two boys stood frozen a moment, then with one accord raced to the control room, where they peered out of the quartzite ports.  \"Great whales, look at that thing!\" Jon shouted as they caught their first glimpse outside.  \"Yeow!\" Jak yelled in amazement. \"What do you suppose it is?\"  \"Never saw anything like it before.\"  They stared in awe at the tremendous creature standing in the little clearing, looking belligerently toward their ship. It was so unlike any Earth beast it was no wonder the boys were startled. The huge body was covered with heavily matted fur. It must have been at least a dozen feet long, and stood about eight feet tall. But the striking thing was that the body was triangular, and the beast was three-legged--two at the back and one in front.  There was no tail, and the blocky legs--one at each corner of the weirdly triangular body--seemed to end in clawed feet. The head was shaped something like that of a horse, but the huge mouth, now partly open, was seen to contain great fangs, larger than those of any beast the boys had ever seen in Terran zoos or on any planet they had visited. Two of the tusks were almost like the ones they had seen in pictures of ancient saber-toothed tigers.  The whole getup gave such an effect of fierceness that both boys felt a shiver run down their spines. Jak's voice was tremulous as he spoke. \"Yipe! I'm sure glad I'm not out there with that.\"  Jon was slow in answering. \"Yet, if we're going out at all....\" He hesitated, then continued, \"We'll either have to chase it away, or kill it.\"  \"If we can,\" his brother retorted.  \"I think our guns'll handle it,\" Jon said. \"The question is, how are we going to do it without exposing ourselves?\"  Jak thought swiftly. \"Maybe we could open the outer lock door a crack, just enough to see through and aim our guns.\"  \"Yes, I guess that's it.\"  \"Don't say anything to Mother,\" Jak cautioned.  \"Of course not, silly. Come on, let's see if we can kill it.\"  The two ran to the airlock and opened the inner door. Leaving it open, they examined their guns to make sure they were fully loaded. Then Jon punched the button to open the outer lockdoor. It was possible to do this while the inner one was still open, since there was now air outside to equalize the pressure. When the door had swung open a couple of feet, Jon stopped the motor, and joined his brother, who was peering through the opening.  The huge creature was still facing them, about forty yards from the ship. One of its rear feet was now pawing at the ground, tearing up great chunks of sod, while it roared its mighty challenge time and again.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50682"],["title","The Planet Mappers (#5)"],["body","\"I'll kneel and aim for the left eye. You stand over me and try to hit the other.\" Jak took swift command. \"Then try for the brain or heart, and keep pumping while our ammo lasts or until we kill it.\"  \"Right.\" Jon took his place and aimed his gun. \"Count three and we'll fire together.\"  Jak knelt and steadied his rifle with one elbow on his extended knee. \"One ... two ... three ... fire!\"  As the two shots crashed out the creature sprang into the air a couple of feet. A great scream of pain and rage shook the very ground and made the air tremble. It hesitated only a moment, then charged toward the ship at terrific speed.  The boys pumped shots as fast as they could. Both had hit the head, but neither had put out an eye as they had hoped. They kept firing as fast as they could work their guns. Blood spouted from numerous wounds on the beast. But still it came on madly, with swift though lumbering bounds.  \"Back quick, and shut the door,\" Jak yelled as his hammer clicked on an empty gun. He pushed backward and scrambled to his feet as Jon leaped to the door controls. The heavy door swung shut ... and the boys breathed a sigh of relief.  But almost at once their eyes filled with fear. They cringed back when they felt the ship itself shudder as that heavy body struck against it.  As swiftly as their trembling legs would carry them, they raced back to the control room. They reached it just in time to see the huge triped lunge against the side of the ship a second time ... and again held their breaths as it did so once more.  The beast's slow mind evidently realized, then, that it could not so easily overthrow this strange, great thing that had appeared so mysteriously in its jungle clearing. It backed away some little distance, still roaring out in that horrible voice.  Once again the beast bunched its mighty muscles for another attack ... when it seemed to stop in the middle of a roar. It wobbled a bit. Slowly its mighty legs buckled, and it sprawled on the ground. A few spasmodic shudders, a convulsive shiver that ran through the tremendous frame, then it was still.  The boys let out their breaths. They were just beginning to congratulate themselves when the door of the control room opened and their mother's frightened face appeared.  \"What was that, Boys? I was taking a nap, but your shooting woke me, than I felt the ship shake as though there was an earthquake or something.\"  \"It was noth....\" Jon began, but Jak went up to her and put his arm about her.  \"It was just a big animal, Mother. Jon and I killed it.\"  \"An animal? Big enough to jar the ship that way? Where is it?\" she gasped.  Jak pointed silently toward the port, and she hurried to look out. At sight of that huge mountain of flesh she cried out, and her face became ever more white and strained.  \"What a horrible beast! Are you sure it's dead?\"  \"Quite sure. It wasn't hard to kill.\" Jak minimized the danger and made himself grin encouragingly. \"I'm going out and hack off some steaks. Bet they'll be good, too.\"  \"You'll do no such thing!\" she cried, shocked. \"Now you boys listen to your mother. You're not to budge outside the ship. I want you to leave this awful world at once.\"  The two boys looked at their mother, and suddenly they seemed to feel strength and maturity growing within them. As though the act had been discussed and rehearsed, they both came up and, taking their mother each by an arm, led her out of the control room and back to their living quarters. There they sat her down in her favorite recline seat.  \"Look, Mother, you know how much we both love you and want to obey you always,\" Jak said earnestly. \"But we're in a peculiar situation here....\"  \"On a strange planet, and Pop out of commission,\" Jon broke in.  \"I know Jon and I are still boys,\" Jak continued, \"but we're all the men here right now. We think you've got to begin trusting us to make the decisions.\"  \"Jak's right,\" Jon chimed in. \"We're not going to take any fool chances, but I say we've got to go ahead and do things just as we think Pop would if he was well and in command. As best we can, that is.\"  Mrs. Carver looked from one son to the other doubtfully for a long minute, then smiled tremulously.  \"I keep forgetting you're not my babies any longer,\" she said slowly. \"Mothers do that, you know. You're both almost grown men; I know you have good minds, almost mature minds. The various things you've been through have done that. So I release you from my apron strings. You two take charge, and do whatever you feel necessary.\"  They threw themselves on their knees, one on either side of her, their arms about her.  \"Oh, Mother, we didn't mean it like that!\"  \"We never felt you had us tied to your apron strings, Mom,\" Jon added. \"We still want to be your boys, even though we do have to act like men--at least until Pop takes charge again.\"  Her smile now was warm and tender, all hesitancy and most of the fears gone. \"Mr. C. and I have tried to make you self-reliant and resourceful, and he'll be as proud of you as I am. You're right--you are the men of the party and must do whatever you decide should be done. But be careful,\" she could not help adding.  \"We will, Mother.\"  \"We think just as much of us as you do,\" Jon quipped.  They left her sitting there, then, and went back to the control room. As they came close to the window-ports they peered through eagerly, and were surprised to see the huge carcass of the triped literally covered with strange looking winged, featherless but fur-covered, bird-things. The latter had large, sharp beaks, with which they were tearing great gobs of flesh from the hulk, gulping them down with ravenous relish.  \"Scavengers!\" Jon exclaimed, his eyes glued to the scene.  \"Yes, there go our steaks.\" Jak's tone was so lugubrious that Jon looked up and laughed. \"I had hoped for some fresh meat.\"  \"There'll be plenty later on,\" Jon consoled his brother. \"Probably this one would've been too tough, anyway.\"  Jak suddenly chuckled. \"Yes, like the fox said, the grapes were probably sour.\"  They grinned companionably at each other, then turned back to watch through the port again. So numerous and so voracious were the scavenger birds that within a few minutes they had even that mammoth carcass stripped of flesh, leaving only the huge bones. One by one, the birds then flew into the forest, the last ones fighting among themselves for the few remaining scraps of stringy flesh or entrails before they, too, took wing.  \"Shall we try it now?\" Jak asked after the last of the bird-things had gone.  \"Might as well. We sure don't want to be cooped up here forever.\"  They went back to the airlock again, making sure their guns were reloaded and their ammo belts filled. When both boys were in the lock, Jon punched the button that closed the inner door, then opened the outer one. \"Safer for Mom to have one of them shut,\" he exclaimed.  The two stood there a moment, looking all about them. Except for that strange pile of huge bones, now covered thickly with some sort of reddish, chitinous-covered, ant-like insects, the clearing seemed empty of all life except the peculiar, flower-like grasses.  Jon climbed down to the ground and Jak followed closely. They walked a short distance away, then turned and looked back, scanning carefully in all directions to make sure no enemy was at their backs.  \"Let's go over and study that jungle a bit,\" Jak suggested when they were sure their rear was not, apparently, menaced.  Jon had been looking at the remains of the beast. \"I'd like to try to salvage those tusks,\" he said, and with Jak at his side went up to them. The two boys managed, after considerable work, to get the great fangs out of the jaws. They brushed off the clinging insects, then ran back and placed the tusks inside the lock.  \"Thanks, Owl. Now we'll go take a look at your trees. Then I want to examine the tubes and the outside of the ship. But we'd better stick together, at least this first time. So I'll sort of cover you, then when you've had a looksee, we'll go back and you keep guard while I see what shape the boat's in.\"  \"Right. Let's get going.\"  Once past the seared place, they found that the peculiar, flower-tipped grasses were as stiff as wheat stubble. The grass-blades were knife sharp, but unable to penetrate the heavy, knee-high leather boots the boys wore.  Jak stooped to examine and study them. \"The blossoms all seem to have three of these whitish petals,\" he said as he rose at last, \"and that yellowish bulb in the center will be the seed pod.\"  When they started on again, they found walking difficult until they learned the trick of scuffling along without trying to raise their feet above the tops of the grasses each step. Then it was easier, particularly since the gravity here was about five per cent less than that of Terra, so they weighed less and their strength consequently seemed greater.  The trees were closely clustered for the most part, and after studying them for some time Jak said, \"They're a lot like some of the pines back home, although not too much like any I ever saw.\"  \"Notice how there're no limbs until you get up thirty feet or so?\" Jon asked. \"They'd be hard to climb without spurs.\" Indeed, after anyone did reach the first low limbs he would not be in much better shape for climbing, for the branches were ten to fifteen feet apart all the way up.  \"Don't see any fruits, though maybe we're just not where any fruit trees are growing,\" Jak said after a bit.  \"Yes, lots of woods back home don't have any fruit or nut trees in them.\"  The strange grasses grew only in small, occasional clusters inside the forest, but the ground was so deeply covered with fallen twigs, rotted branches and the needle-like leaves of previous years, that walking was extremely difficult, almost impossible in places.  \"There're probably trails somewhere--that triped would've made some sort of path.\"  \"He sure was heavy enough, and if this was part of his regular stamping"]]]
