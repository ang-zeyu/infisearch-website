If protected from the lightest touch it will do the same.  It appeals to me that this liquid is abdominal, partly thrown off to assist the moth in emergence; something very like that bath of birth which accompanies and facilitates human entrance into the world.  It helps the struggling moth in separating from the case, wets the down so that it will pass the small opening, reduces the large abdomen so that it will escape the exit, and softens the case and silk where the moth is working. With either male or female the increase in size is so rapid that neither could be returned to their cases five minutes after they have left them.  It is generally supposed that the spray thrown by a developing moth is for the purpose of attracting others of its kind.  I have my doubts.  With moths that have been sheltered and not even touched by a breath of wind, this spray is thrown very frequently before the moth is entirely dry, long before it is able to fly and before the ovipositor is thrust out.  According to my sense of smell there is very little odour to the spray and what there is would be dissipated hours before night and time for the moths to fly  and seek mates.  I do not think that the spray thrown so soon after escape from cocoon or case is to attract the sexes, any farther than that much of it in one place on something that it would saturate might leave a general 'mothy' odour.  Some lepidopterists think this spray a means of defence; if this is true I fail to see why it should be thrown when there is nothing disturbing the moth.  Many of the spinning moths use leaves for their outer foundation. Some appear as if snugly rolled in a leaf and hanging from a twig, but examination will prove that the stem is silk covered to hold the case when the leaf loosens.  This is the rule with all Promethea cocoons I ever have seen.  Polyphemus selects a cluster of leaves very frequently thorn, and weaves its cocoon against three, drawing them together and spinning a support the length of the stems, so that when the leaf is ready to fall the cocoon is safely anchored.  When the winter winds have beaten the edges from the leaves, the cocoon appears as if it were brown, having three ribs with veins running from them, and of triangular shape. Angulifera spins against the leaves but provides no support and so drops to the ground.  Luna spins a comparatively thin white case, among the leaves under the shelter of logs and stumps.  Io spins so slightly in confinement that the pupa case and cast skin show through.  I never have found a pupa out of doors, but this is a ground caterpillar.  Sometimes the caterpillar has been stung and bad an egg placed in its skin by a parasite, before pupation.  In such case the pupa is destroyed by the developing fly.  Throughout one winter I was puzzled by the light weight of what appeared to be a good Polyphemus cocoon, and at time for emergence amazed by the tearing and scratching inside the cocoon, until what I think was an Ophion fly appeared.  It was honey yellow, had antennae long as its extremely long body, the abdomen of which was curved and the segments set together so as to appear notched.  The wings were transparent and the insect it seems is especially designed to attack Polyphemus caterpillars and help check a progress that otherwise might become devastating.  Among the moths that do not feed, the year of their evolution is divided into about seven days for the life of the moth, from fifteen to thirty for the eggs, from five to six weeks for the caterpillar and the remainder of the time in the pupa stage.  The rule differs with feeding moths only in that after mating and egg placing they take food and live several months, often until quite heavy frosts have fallen.  One can admire to fullest extent the complicated organism, wondrous colouring, and miraculous life processes in the evolution of a moth, but that is all.  Their faces express nothing; their attitudes tell no story.  There is the marvellous instinct through which the males locate the opposite sex of their species; but one cannot see instinct in the face of any creature; it must develop in acts.  There is no part of their lives that makes such pictures of mother-love as birds and animals afford.  The male finds a mate and disappears.  The female places her eggs and goes out before her caterpillars break their shells.  The caterpillar transforms to the moth without its consent, the matter in one upbuilding the other. The entire process is utterly devoid of sentiment, attachment or volition on the part of the creatures involved.  They work out a law as inevitable as that which swings suns, moons, and planets in their courses.  They  are the most fragile and beautiful result of natural law with which I am acquainted.    CHAPTER III The Robin Moth: Cecropia   When only a little child, wandering alone among the fruits and flowers of our country garden, on a dead peach limb beside the fence I found it--my  first Cecropia.  I was the friend of every bird, flower, and butterfly.  I carried crumbs to the warblers in the sweetbrier; was lifted for surreptitious peeps at the hummingbird nesting in the honeysuckle; sat within a few feet of the robin in the catalpa; bugged the currant bushes for the phoebe that had built for years under the roof of the corn bin; and fed young blackbirds in the hemlock with worms gathered from the cabbages.  I knew how to insinuate myself into the private life of each bird that homed on our farm, and they were many, for we valiantly battled for their protection with every kind of intruder.  There were wrens in the knot holes, chippies in the fences, thrushes in the brush heaps, bluebirds in the hollow apple trees, cardinals in the bushes, tanagers in the saplings, fly-catchers in the trees, larks in the wheat, bobolinks in the clover, killdeers beside the creeks, swallows in the chimneys, and martins under the barn eaves.  My love encompassed all feathered and furred creatures.  Every day visits were paid flowers I cared for most.  I had been taught not to break the garden blooms, and if a very few of the wild ones were taken, I gathered them carefully, and explained to the plants that I wanted them for my mother because she was so ill she could not come to them any more, and only a few touching her lips or lying on her pillow helped her to rest, and made vivid the fields and woods when the pain was severe.  My love for the butterflies took on the form of adoration.  There was not a delicate, gaudy, winged creature of day that did not make so strong an appeal to my heart as to be almost painful.  It seemed to me that the most exquisite thoughts of God for our pleasure were materialized in their beauty.  My soul always craved colour, and more brilliancy could be found on one butterfly wing than on many flower faces.  I liked to slip along the bloom-bordered walks of that garden and stand spell-bound, watching a black velvet butterfly, which trailed wings painted in white, red, and green, as it clambered over a clump of sweet-williams, and indeed, the flowers appeared plain compared with it!  Butterflies have changed their habits since then.  They fly so high!  They are all among the treetops now.  They used to flit around the cinnamon pinks, larkspur, ragged-robins and tiger lilies, within easy reach of little fingers, every day.  I called them 'flying flowers,' and it was a pretty conceit, for they really were more delicate in texture and brighter in colouring than the garden blooms.  Having been taught that God created the heavens, earth and all things therein, I understood it to mean a literal creation of each separate thing and creature, as when my father cut down a tree and hewed it into a beam.  I would spend hours sitting so immovably among the flowers of our garden that the butterflies would mistake me for a plant and alight on my head and hands, while I strove to conceive the greatness of a Being who could devise and colour all those different butterfly wings.  I would try to decide whether He created the birds, flowers, or butterflies first; ultimately coming to the conclusion that He put His most exquisite material into the butterflies, and then did the best He could with what remained, on the birds and flowers.  In my home there was a cellar window on the south, covered with wire screening, that was my individual property.  Father placed a box beneath it so that I could reach the sill easily, and there were very few butterflies or insects common to eastern North America a specimen of which had not spent some days on that screen, feasted on leaves and flowers, drunk from saucers of sweetened water, been admired and studied in minutest detail, and then set free to enjoy life as before.  With Whitman, \"I never was possessed with a mania for killing things.\"  I had no idea of what families they were, and I supplied my own names.  The Monarch was the Brown Velvet; the Viceroy  was his Cousin; the Argynnis was the Silver Spotted; and the Papilio Ajax was the Ribbon butterfly, in my  category.  There was some thought of naming Ajax, Dolly Varden; but on close inspection it seemed most to resemble the gayly striped ribbons my sisters wore.  I was far afield as to names, but in later years with only a glance at any  specimen I could say, \"Oh, yes! I always have known that. It has buff-coloured legs, clubbed antennae with buff tips, wings of purplish brown velvet with escalloped margins, a deep band of buff lightly traced with black bordering them, and a pronounced point close the apex of the front pair.  When it came to books, all they had to teach me were the names.  I had captured and studied butterflies, big, little, and with every conceivable variety of marking, until it was seldom one was found whose least peculiarity was not familiar to me as my own face; but what could this be?  It clung to the rough bark, slowly opening and closing large wings of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],["title","Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#7)"],["body","velvet down, margined with bands made of shades of grey, tan, and black; banded with a broad stripe of red terra cotta colour with an inside margin of white, widest on the back pair. Both pairs of wings were decorated with half-moons of white, outlined in black and strongly flushed with terra cotta; the front pair near the outer margin had oval markings of blue-black, shaded with grey, outlined with half circles of white, and secondary circles of black.  When the wings were raised I could see a face of terra cotta, with small eyes, a broad band of white across the forehead, and an abdomen of terra cotta banded with snowy white above, and spotted with white beneath.  Its legs were hairy, and the antennae antlered like small branching ferns. Of course I thought it was a butterfly, and for a time was too filled with wonder to move.  Then creeping close, the next time the wings were raised above its body, with the nerveless touch of a robust child I captured it.  I was ten miles from home, but I had spent all my life until the last year on that farm, and I knew and loved every foot of it.  To leave it for a city home and the confinement of school almost had broken my heart, but it really was time for me to be having some formal education.  It had been the greatest possible treat to be allowed to return to the country for a week, but now my one idea was to go home with my treasure.  None of my people had seen a sight like that.  If they had, they would have told me.  Borrowing a two-gallon stone jar from the tenant's wife, I searched the garden for flowers sufficiently rare for lining.  Nothing so pleased me as some gorgeous deep red peony  blooms.  Never having been allowed to break the flowers when that was my mother's home, I did not think of doing it because she was not there to know. I knelt and gathered all the fallen petals that were fresh, and then spreading my apron on the ground, jarred the plant, not harder than a light wind might, and all that fell in this manner it seemed right to take.  The selection was very pleasing, for the yellow glaze of the jar, the rich red of the petals, and the grey velvet of my prize made a picture over which I stood trembling in delight.  The moth was promptly christened the Half-luna, because my father had taught me that luna was the moon, and the half moons on the wings were its most prominent markings.  The tenant's wife wanted me to put it in a pasteboard box, but I stubbornly insisted on having the jar, why, I do not know, but I suppose it was because my father's word was gospel to me, and he had said that the best place to keep my specimens was the cellar window, and I must have thought the jar the nearest equivalent to the cellar.  The Half-luna did not mind in the least, but went on lazily opening and closing its wings, yet making no attempt to fly. If I had known what it was, or anything of its condition, I would have understood that it had emerged from the cocoon that morning, and never had flown, but was establishing circulation preparatory to taking wing.  Being only a small, very ignorant girl, the greatest thing I knew for sure was what I loved.  Tying my sunbonnet over the top of the jar, I stationed myself on the horse block at the front gate.  Every passing team was hailed with lifted hand, just as I had seen my father do, and in as perfect an imitation of his voice as a scared little girl making her first venture alone in the big world could muster, I asked, \"Which way, Friend?\"  For several long, hot hours people went to every point of the compass, but at last a bony young farmer, with a fat wife, and a fatter baby, in a big wagon, were going to my city, and they said I might ride.  With quaking heart I handed up my jar, and climbed in, covering all those ten miles in the June sunshine, on a board laid across e wagon bed, tightly  clasping the two-gallon jar in my aching arms.  The farmer's wife was quite concerned about me.  She asked if I had butter, and I said, \"Yes, the kind that flies.\"  I slipped the bonnet enough to let them peep.  She did not seem to think much of it, but the farmer laughed until his tanned face was red as an Indian's.  His wife insisted on me putting down the jar, and offered to set her foot on it so that it would not 'jounce' much, but I did not propose to risk it 'jouncing' at all, and clung to it persistently.  Then she offered to tie her apron over the top of the jar if I would put my bonnet on my  head, but I was afraid to attempt the exchange for fear my  butterfly would try to escape, and I might crush it, a thing I almost never had allowed to happen.  The farmer's wife stuck her elbow into his ribs, and said, \"How's that for the queerest spec'men ye ever see?\"  The farmer answered, \"I never saw nothin' like it before.\"  Then she said, \"Aw pshaw!  I didn't mean in the jar!\"  Then they both laughed. I thought they were amused at me, but I had no intention of risking an injury to my Half-luna, for there had been one black day on which I had such a terrible experience that it entailed a lifetime of caution.  I had captured what I afterward learned was an Asterias, that seemed slightly different from any previous specimen, and a yellow swallow-tail, my first Papilio Turnus.  The yellow one was the largest, most beautiful butterfly I ever had seen.  I was carrying them, one between each thumb and forefinger, and running with all possible speed to reach the screen before my touch could soil the down on their exquisite wings.  I stumbled, and fell, so suddenly, there was no time to release them.  The black one sailed away with a ragged wing, and the yellow was crushed into a shapeless mass in my hand.  I was accustomed to falling off fences, from trees, and into the creek, and because my  mother was an invalid I had learned to doctor my own bruises and uncomplainingly go my  way. My reputation was that of a very brave little girl;  but when I opened my hand and saw that broken butterfly, and my down-painted fingers, I was never more afraid in my life.  I screamed aloud in panic, and ran for my mother with all my  might.  Heartbroken, I could not control my voice to explain as I threw myself on her couch, and before I knew what they  were doing, I was surrounded by sisters and the cook with hot water, bandages and camphor.  My mother clasped me in her arms, and rocked me on her breast. \"There, there, my poor child,\" she said, \"I know it hurts dreadfully!\" And to the cook she commanded, \"Pour on camphor quickly!  She is half killed, or she never would come to me like this.\"  I found my voice.  \"Camphor won't do any  good,\" I wailed.  \"It was the most beautiful butterfly, and I've broken it all to pieces.  It must have taken God hours studying how to make it different from all the others, and I know He never will forgive me!\"  I began sobbing worse than ever.  The cook on her knees before me sat on her heels suddenly.  \"Great Heavens!  She's screechin' about breakin' a butterfly, and not her poor fut, at all!\"  Then I looked down and discovered that I had stubbed my toe in falling, and had left a bloody trail behind me.  \"Of course I am!\"  I sobbed indignantly.  \"Couldn't I wash off a little blood in the creek, and tie up my toe with a dock leaf and some grass?  I've killed the most beautiful butterfly, and I know I won't be forgiven!\"  I opened my tightly clenched hand and showed it to prove my words.  The sight was so terrible to me that I jerked my foot from the cook, and thrust my hand into the water, screaming, \"Wash it! Wash it!  Wash the velvet from my hand!  Oh! make it white again!\"  Before the cook bathed and bandaged my foot, she washed and dried my hand; and my mother whispered, \"God knows you never meant to do it, and He is sorry as mother is.\"  So my mother and the cook comforted me.  The remainder scattered suddenly. It was years before I knew why, and I was a Shakespearean student before I caught the point to their frequently calling me 'Little Lady Macbeth!'  After such an experience, it was not probable that I would risk crushing a butterfly to tie a bonnet on my head.  It probably would be down my back half the time anyway.  It usually was.  As we neared the city I heard the farmer's wife tell him that he must take me to my home.  He said he would not do any such a thing, but she said he must.  She explained that she knew me, and it would not be decent to put me down where they were going, and leave me to walk home and carry that heavy  jar.  So the farmer took me to our gate.  I thanked him as politely as I knew how, and kissed his wife and the fat baby in payment for their kindness, for I was very grateful.  I was so tired I scarcely could set down the jar and straighten my cramped arms when I had the opportunity.  I had expected my family to be delighted over my  treasure, but they  exhibited an astonishing indifference, and were far more concerned over the state of my blistered face.  I would not hear of putting my Half-luna on the basement screen as they suggested, but enthroned it in state on the best lace curtains at a parlour window, covered the sill with leaves and flowers, and went to bed happy.  The following morning my sisters said a curtain was ruined, and when they removed it to attempt restoration, the general consensus of opinion seemed to be that something was a nuisance, I could not tell whether it was I, or the Half-luna.  On coming to the parlour a little later, ladened with leaves and flowers, my treasure was gone.  The cook was sure it had flown from the door over some one's head, and she said very tersely that it was a burning shame, and if such carelessness as that ever occurred again she would quit her job.  Such is the confidence of a child that I accepted my loss as an inevitable accident, and tried to be brave to comfort her, although my heart was almost broken. Of course they freed my moth.  They never would have dared but that the little mother's couch stood all day empty now,"]]]
