These people used natural gas for their nighttime outdoor illuminating--just semi-ornate standards with the flames rising a foot or so above them. Men went around at dusk to light them, and again at dawn to turn them off.  Hanlon had walked slowly for several blocks when he saw a native approaching him. When they came abreast the man stopped him.  \"I do not remember seeing you about here before,\" he said, looking closely at Hanlon in the flickering light. \"I am the peace keeper for this district,\" he added as he saw Hanlon's questioning look.  \"No, I just moved in a few days ago,\" Hanlon answered.  \"What do you do here? Do you have a job?\"  \"He thinks I'm a vag,\" Hanlon grinned to himself, and said aloud, in a courteous voice, \"I just came from the Eastern Continent, nyer, and hope to become a public entertainer. I have enough money to support myself until I can earn more.\"  \"That is good. If I can ever be of service in helping you to get acquainted, please look me up. I like to see all the people in my district happy and busy.\"  \"I shall do that, nyer, and thank you for your courtesy.\" And as the man moved to one side, Hanlon gave him a cheery half-salute, and went on his way. \"Darned nice people, really,\" he said to himself. \"They'll make good Federation citizens.\"  When Hanlon had started out on this stroll he had had no special destination--was merely out for a breather. But as he ambled along a thought came to him, and he quickened his pace and walked more purposefully toward the downtown section and a certain building he had previously spotted.  It was a small \"place where men drank,\" and his investigations had convinced him that many of this city's criminal element went there for relaxation. The cafe occupied the street floor of a small two-storied building that was, as were almost all the Estrellan buildings, a five-sided one.  For _five_ was the sacred number of the native religion and philosophy. Hanlon had learned that the number five was consistently used wherever possible, even in their architecture, their ornaments, and their coined money.  Their religion was based on five basic Truths taught by He Who Died For Them. These were: Love, Faith, Brotherliness, Honor, and Loyalty. Their philosophy (they called it their \"Code of Living\") was also composed of five parts: to be religious; to attain the highest possible mentality; to live physically clean lives; to be considerate of others always, and to be honest in all dealings.  The Terrans had found that while, of course, there were individuals who did not subscribe either to their religion or their Code of Living, that on the whole the race held a very high standard of ethics.  Now, as he walked inside the drinking place, the young S S man saw that the pentagonal room was brilliantly lighted, rather than kept dim as were most Terran and Simonidean cafes.  \"Probably because they can't turn 'em low,\" he thought. For the lights were lamps burning a carbide compound, that gave out a harsh but very bright light.  As Hanlon took a seat at a small table, he looked about him interestedly. There was a bar across the back or third side, where the drinks were mixed. On the other four sides, except where the windows or doors interferred, were several small booths, with drawn curtains across their entrances for privacy. The balance of the floor was filled with two-, three- and five-place pentagonal tables, and their chairs, or rather, backless stools.  \"What is your wish?\" an attendant came to Hanlon's table.  \"Glass of mykkyl, please.\"  While the waiter was bringing the barely-intoxicating but very popular drink, and later as Hanlon was slowly sipping it, the S S man let his mind roam throughout the small room, touching mind after mind, seeking and hoping to find those he had come here trying to locate.  He had to grit his teeth to keep from showing the frustration he felt on this world when trying to understand what these people were thinking. For he had long since found that, whatever a human might be speaking in words, his thoughts showed his true feelings simultaneously with and despite what he was saying. And Hanlon could usually read those surface thoughts and understand them fully.  But with the Estrellans, he had found this was not always true. There was sometimes an ... an _obliqueness_ ... that could not be directly translated by one no more used to their thought-patterns than he was so far.  George Hanlon was the only member of the Inter-Stellar Corps' secret service who could read minds at all--one of the very few humans ever to possess this ability to any demonstrable extent. And he was still young enough to feel occasionally that he was being badly treated by his inability to read these native minds at will.  While he was on that Simonidean assignment, and on the planet of Algon, he had even learned to telepath with the natives, the Guddu \"Greenies,\" or plant-men. But here he could not do that at all. He could read and control animal minds, \"and these lousy Estrellans are almost animals,\" he had growled beneath his breath at first, \"so why can't I handle their minds?\"  But even through this rude shock to his vanity he did not entirely lose his ability to think and reason logically. He had studied the problem intensively for these past days, and had come to certain preliminary conclusions.  \"It's not, after all, that they're lower in the evolutionary scale than we Terrans are,\" he finally concluded. \"It's just that they haven't advanced as far in scientific and technological knowledge. They may look like apes, but they sure aren't. Probably, when we get to really know them--if we ever do--we'll find they are 'way ahead of us in many things. They certainly, as a whole, practice their 'Code of Living' far better than most of our people do their professed religion.\"  This conclusion was another shock to his confident young mind. For he had more than half expected, when he first came here, to have an easy time of it in solving the problem on which he and the other secret servicemen were working.  Yet how quickly he had been disabused.  And now, in this little place where men drank, he was finding it out anew. None of the minds he was scanning with all the ability he possessed, was quite of the calibre he sought, although most of them displayed leanings toward larceny and other criminal tendencies. For this drinking place was not one which the more generally law-abiding and decent people of Stearra cared to patronize.  Maddeningly meager were the thoughts he could interpret, but when he finally came to scan the minds of four natives who were seated at a five-place table near the back, close to the bar, he made an almost unconscious exclamation of surprise and delight.  He \"listened in\" more closely to the four, who were leaning toward each other, talking together in low, earnest tones. Hanlon could read the surface thoughts in each mind, but only occasionally at first could he understand what they were discussing. However, as he became more accustomed to their individual peculiarities of thought, he began to get enough to convince him that these were the ones he was seeking. At least, they were planning some deviltries, and one spoke as though he had received orders as to what they were to do.  Hanlon even finally got their names, although of the latter he soon became interested mainly in that of the slender, blondishly-hairy native with the steely blue eyes. That one, Ran Auldin, was their leader, Hanlon decided.  More intently now, Hanlon studied their minds, paying no further attention to the others in the room. He lingered over his drinks for nearly an hour, \"listening in\" on the conversation of these mobsters, and learning quite a bit about their criminal activities, and better how to interpret their thoughts.  Suddenly he stiffened in even closer attention.  \"The leader,\" Auldin was saying to his henchmen, but Hanlon knew from his side thoughts that the fellow meant Ino Yandor, \"wants us to start a series of fires and wreckings about the city. We'll get a list of places tomorrow or next day, and that night we'll do the job.\"  \"In the name of Zappa, why?\" one of the men asked. \"Why would he want us to do that?\"  \"Who cares why?\" Auldin shrugged. \"The leader, he tells us 'do this', and we do it, that's all.\"  \"Sure,\" another chimed in. \"We get paid for our work, and good pay, too. So let the big fellows worry about why they want certain things done.\"  \"That's the way to look at it,\" Auldin said. \"We'll meet here tomorrow evening, and I'll probably have the list. If not tomorrow, then next day. But meet here tomorrow, anyway.\"  So, Hanlon thought swiftly. Just like small-time crooks everywhere. Somebody with brains does the bossing, and they stupidly follow orders, interested only in the pay they receive, caring nothing about who or what gets hurt.  These fellows were certainly worth watching, he decided. Even if it did not lead him to the larger goal he was seeking--and he felt sure it would--he would spike their plans somehow.  He felt he had heard enough for the time being, so he rose and left the drinking place before they should notice him. He walked slowly back to his apartment, thinking about this new plan, wondering, as the mobster had done, why such orders were given. It made no sense to him, unless it was that the chief criminals were merely intent on spreading a reign of terror and destruction.  \"Or are they,\" he thought suddenly, \"planning later to make it seem as though we Terrans are doing it? Perhaps planning to start a whispering campaign of such rumors?\"  More than ever now he was determined that such activities must be stopped. \"We've got to clean up this planet, and get it into the Federation. If they keep on this way, they can be a real menace. But with this criminal activity wiped out, and Estrella a member of the Federation, we can help them so much--and they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50863"],["title","Alien Minds (#4)"],["body","a lot to teach us, too.\"     CHAPTER 3   The following day Hanlon continued working with his roches. He now \"drilled\" them as soldiers are drilled. He taught himself how to control their minds in unison, making them march in all the various complicated maneuvers of squads and columns, all in perfect alignment and cadence.  It was tricky, delicate work, requiring as it did placing a portion of his mind in each roch's brain, giving that mind and body individual commands, yet keeping enough central control in his own mind so they all performed exactly together.  So much of his mind was transferred to theirs, that he had to learn how to make his own body \"stand at attention\" during these maneuvers, with but minimum control over his own functions.  Hour after hour he worked with them, giving them fifteen minutes of rest out of each half-hour--and thus giving his own brain rest at the same time. For this was tiring work for him, as well as for them.  When dusk fell he stopped the training, saw to it that the roches were well-fed and watered, then put them all to sleep. He dressed for the street, went out and found an eating place, where he did full justice to a good meal.  \"One thing you've got to hand these folks,\" he thought thankfully, \"they certainly can cook, even though some of their dishes have a most unusual taste.\"  It had taken him several days to discover which native dishes he liked and could digest, for some of them almost made him ill, others had a taste he could not stomach, but most of them were delicious--and Hanlon was ordinarily a good trencherman.  His meal finished, Hanlon paid and went back to the drinking place where he sat, toying with a glass of mykkyl while waiting for Auldin and the others to appear.  They came in shortly, one by one, and Hanlon \"listened in\" on Auldin's mind as the chief mobster gave his fellows directions as to the places they were to burn or wreck. Hanlon had already prepared a note, addressed to the head of the local peace-keepers. To this he now added the addresses Auldin was giving. When he was sure he had them all, he slipped out of the little cafe.  He went swiftly along the streets toward the Stearra police headquarters, which he had previously located, keeping watch until he saw a dog-like roch running along. Quickly reaching out and taking control of its mind, Hanlon made the animal follow him until he could duck into a deserted doorway.  Hanlon made his messenger take the prepared note carefully in its mouth, then trot down the street and into the \"police station.\" There it ran up to the man in charge, and raised itself up with its front paws on the man's knees.  \"What in the name of...?\" the official looked down, eyes bugging and mouth slack at the beast's unexpected action. For several moments he seemed not even to notice the paper in the roch's mouth. When he did, he took it gingerly, opened and read it.  \"An attempt will be made just before half-night,\" Hanlon had written, \"to set fire to or wreck the following places of business. If you watch carefully, you can catch the criminals in the act, and save these pieces of property from damage or destruction.\" Then followed the five addresses.  The man read the note twice, a puzzled, anxious frown on his face. He did not quite know what to make of it--or so his attitude seemed to indicate. There had been no \"crime\" on this planet that he had ever had occasion to try to stop. For he was not a police officer in the ordinary sense. The Estrellan \"peace keepers\" merely watched to see that crowds or individuals did not get too boisterous, aided in handling crowds at large gatherings, or assisted home those who may have imbibed too freely.  The fellow scratched the back of his head while he considered the matter at length. \"Some phidi trying to make a fool of me,\" he finally said aloud, as Hanlon heard through his roch's ears, as he had been watching through its eyes. \"But how in the name of Zappa did whoever it was train this roch to bring me the note like this?\"  This latter problem seemed to have greater interest for him than the warning. For his eyes were still watching the roch with puzzled inquiry ... but he did nothing about acting upon Hanlon's suggestion.  As the S S man watched the roch leave the peace keeper's headquarters, he fumed because it was apparent that the official was going to take no action on his warning. Were they in on this criminal activity, he wondered? Was it that wide-spread, that even the supposed law-keepers were party to it?  No, he finally decided, probably this fellow was just a dumb, unimaginative sort of dope.  He watched miserably as the fires were set and the business buildings wrecked. There was nothing else he could do to stop it, for he knew it would only put himself in useless danger to try--would jeopardize what he and the other secret servicemen were trying to accomplish here. But as soon as the damage had been done he found another roch, and sent it back to headquarters with another scathing note.  \"You paid no attention to my previous warning, and as a result two of the buildings I told you about have been set on fire, the windows smashed on another, and two others have been wrecked by explosions. Why don't you use what small brains you possess, and stop this wave of crime? Or are you being paid to ignore it?\"  Through the eyes of the roch Hanlon watched the official read the note, and saw him fly into a rage and pace the floor ... but what the man was thinking Hanlon was too far away to read.  \"One thing sure, I'll have to get busy and make contact with these gangsters,\" Hanlon thought bitterly as he went back to his room and to bed. \"Guess I'm near enough ready to tackle Yandor now. Let's see, shall I do it directly, or...?\"  He undressed and climbed into the low, foot-high, five-sided bed these Estrellans used. There was no mattress or springs, but fortunately his rooms had several extra blankets, and these he had folded beneath him to make his sleeping more comfortable.  He was still wrestling with his problem when he finally dropped off to sleep.  But the next day he figured it out to his satisfaction. He worked with his roches until evening, then went out and got himself a meal. Later he went, purposefully late, into the drinking place. Seeing Auldin and his men already at their table, he went directly up to them.  \"Greetings, Ran Auldin,\" he said boldly. \"I've been looking for you, for I want to join your group. I'm fast and clever with knife or flamegun, and I've got plenty of ideas. I can do us both a lot of good.\"  The other three half-rose, staring at him with hostile eyes. But their chief made a gesture that said \"Wait\", and himself looked Hanlon up and down coolly. \"You are mistaken, my friend,\" he said at last. \"We are not engaged in such activities as might require the use of ... of knife or gun. We are lawful businessmen.\"  Hanlon fitted his face to a crooked smile and his voice was almost sarcastic as he replied, \"Sure, sure, I know. But listen, friend. A fellow out to make a big pile of pentas doesn't do it by being asleep. I've done a lot of scouting 'round and asking questions in a discreet way. I know who I'm talking to.\"  His mind, always in touch with that of the others, read in their surface thoughts the surprised, \"Oh, so that's why we've had the feeling the past few days we were being watched.\" He could tell that this conclusion made them jittery, and more cautious and ready for instant action.  But Hanlon had to keep on the path he had taken.  Aloud, Auldin merely said again, in a voice he kept mild and low, \"I'm sorry, my friend, but you are still mistaken. We work for another man, helping him hunt out talented people and make entertainers out of them.\"  \"During the day, yes,\" Hanlon gave him a wise smile, \"and I can help him a lot in that, too.\"  He knew the three other men had been growing more and more angry at his interruption. He could interpret their thoughts well enough so he was tensed for quick-action, determined not to be caught off guard.  \"But what I'm really interested in,\" Hanlon continued, \"is your evening activities. By the way, I hope none of you got hurt or burned last....\" He wheeled swiftly, for one of the natives had suddenly leaped up and toward him, a dagger in his hand, slashing at him.  Hanlon met him with a light, contemptuous laugh. He ducked beneath the other's knife-slash, then stepped in close. His left fist traveled only a few inches, but all the strength of his powerful shoulder and arm muscles was in the blow. His fist sank to the wrist in the man's solar plexus.  Wind _whooshing_ out, the gangster doubled up in pain. Hanlon chopped down with the edge of his hand on the other's wrist, and the knife clattered to the floor. The Corpsman swung viciously with a right uppercut that lifted his attacker and drove him backward. He crashed into a chair with such force that as man and stool fell to the floor, the wooden seat was splintered.  The other two leaped to their feet and started forward. As though he had eyes in the back of his head and had seen them coming, Hanlon swivelled toward them, his lips thinned in a fighting grin, while several of the cafe attendants were running up.  \"Leave him alone,\" Ran Auldin commanded sharply, and his men looked back at him in astonishment. \"The stranger was only defending himself against an unprovoked attack by Ugen,\" Auldin explained to the cafe's men. He turned to his fellows. \"You two take Ugen home and put him to bed. I want to talk to this stranger.\"  As the surly guards picked up the limp body of their fallen companion and bore him out, the drink-servers returned to their posts. Evidently Ran Auldin was known and respected here. He now faced Hanlon and motioned toward one of the stools.  \"Sit down, my friend,\" he said courteously. \"Perhaps we can do a bit of talking.\"  \"No use for knives, eh?\" Hanlon grinned as he sat down. But immediately he sobered. \"I figured maybe"]]]
