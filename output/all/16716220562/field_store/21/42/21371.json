The air was musty and cool and their footfalls echoed, making scarey hollow noises.  \"Stop!\" Johnny said. He held his fingers to his lips. His words echoed and re-echoed in front of them. Then there was almost silence. A soft padding and clicking sound came from far in the distance. It was the same kind of noise Baba's feet and claws made on stone.  The two started out again at a half run. The slope was almost too steep, and Johnny had to slide to a halt to keep from falling. Baba went bouncing along ahead and out of sight. As the slope became steeper yet, Johnny had to slide forward carefully. He stumbled and went down on his back. His flashlight slipped from his hand and went rolling on down the passage and out of sight.  In a second it was pitch black.  \"Baba,\" Johnny yelled at the top of his lungs. His only answer was his own voice echoing down the long corridor. He pushed himself up into a sitting position and slid on forward on the seat of his pants, his heart beating rapidly.  A few very long minutes later, he saw a light shining in the distance. It was Baba, the flashlight in his paw.  \"Hurry, Johnny!\" he clicked. \"Hurry.\"  With the way lighted for him, Johnny got to his feet and could move faster. As he reached Baba, the passage began to widen and the slope became less steep.  \"I saw him,\" Baba clicked excitedly. \"He was big. I'm sure if we could catch him he'd be a friend! I tried to talk to him but he went on ahead just when you called. Oh, Johnny, I do want to find him.\"  Johnny had never seen Baba so excited.  Suddenly, the passageway ended and they were in a great underground room. Johnny flashed his light around the walls. They, too, were carved with scenes of life on Venus. Beneath each carving was a small doorway leading into a side room. There was one large doorway opposite the one through which they had entered.  \"It looks like a meeting house,\" Johnny said. \"With seats and everything.\" He flashed the light on one of the carvings. He had heard of carvings like these and had seen one once. His father said that they must have been made by an intelligent life form that had visited Venus from the stars. This cave must have been where they had hidden from the animals, just as men now hid from them behind the settlement's great walls. Johnny was awed.  \"Johnny, don't just stand here,\" Baba clicked. \"We've got to find him!\"  Johnny looked from opening to opening.  \"Which way, Baba?\"  The little bear sniffed the air. \"I can't tell,\" he said. \"I can't tell.\" Hurriedly they made a circle about the great room. When they came to the large opening, Baba sniffed carefully.  \"Maybe here,\" he clicked, and plunged through.  Down they went as before. This time Johnny grabbed Baba's harness and they were able to move faster. This corridor was just as steep and curving as the first one.  In a few minutes they emerged into another room. It was smaller than the room above and had three small doorways and one large opening.  \"Let's try them all,\" Baba said. Through each of the three small doorways they entered similar rooms. The fourth opening was another corridor. Again Baba thought he smelled the path of the marva.  Down that corridor they went, down and down. Finally it ended in hundreds of the rooms, large and small, the rock was like a honeycomb. Johnny's flashlight was already growing dim, and they didn't dare try to search much longer.  Trying to follow the scent they took a side corridor that led from one small room to another, and came out into a narrow passageway. A faint light glimmered at the end of it. Baba bounded on ahead, Johnny running to keep up with him.  The light seeped through a pile of rocks. Johnny flashed his light through one of the cracks. Behind the pile of rocks the tunnel continued for several feet. In the light of his flashlight Johnny could see bits of leather on the floor of the outer part of the cave. Just beyond them on the other side of the rocks was the cave Johnny and Baba had rested in while climbing up, the cave in which they had cut the long straps they had used to tie themselves together for the long climb upward. The bits of leather on the floor were scraps that had been left over.  \"Why, we're almost to the bottom,\" Johnny said.  \"Yes,\" Baba clicked. \"I guess we can't find him. I don't smell anything now but arrow-birds,\" he ended sadly.  \"We gotta try,\" Johnny said firmly. He felt hollow inside when he thought Baba might go away for good, but he was convinced now that this was the only way to keep him safe.  \"Let's try farther down.\" Johnny turned around and a few minutes later they were going down one of the curving main corridors again.  This corridor gradually straightened out. Soon it hardly slanted down at all. It finally turned into what seemed to be a long underground tunnel. Johnny had to stoop over to keep from hitting his head on the ceiling.  The passageway was no longer going through solid rock, and its walls and floor were a sticky clay. Johnny's and Baba's feet made squishing noises as they walked. It seemed as if the tunnel would never end. They walked on and on.  \"I think we're going away from New Plymouth Rock,\" Baba clicked.  \"I think so, too,\" Johnny answered. \"We must've already gone 'most a mile.\"  The walls had narrowed until Johnny and Baba had to walk single file. Suddenly the passageway slanted upward and a faint glow of light could be seen far away. As they began to climb toward the light the ceiling became so low Johnny had to crawl on his hands and knees. It was a long, sticky climb.  As they approached within a few yards of the light, Baba stopped, blocking Johnny's way.  \"This cave must end up in the jungle outside the colony wall,\" the little bear clicked. \"Maybe we ought to stop.\" He sounded worried.  But Johnny was not going to let this chance pass.  \"Go on,\" he urged.  \"But the rhinosaurs....\"  \"Who's afraid of an old rhinosaur?\" Johnny demanded.  \"You are,\" Baba clicked. But he scrambled on.  They emerged into the blinding light in the center of a tangle of thick, high brush. They were out in the jungle, far away from the rock!  The boy and his bear were covered with mud from head to foot. They peered carefully around, listening. In the distance they could hear the rumble of moving rhinosaurs.  As they crept away from the cave, their view continued to be blocked by large bushes and trees. They couldn't even see New Plymouth Rock. Stepping quietly and carefully they finally came to an opening in the brush. Far to the right was the Rock--and, farther in the distance, a guard tower.  \"Get back,\" Johnny shouted. \"The guard will see us.\" The two jumped back.  There was a grunt behind them. They turned. Behind a screen of brush, a great blue-scaled rhinosaur was waking up. It was between them and the opening to the cave. It snorted with the sound of a deep bass drum, and heaved up on its feet.  Ahead, at the edge of the clearing, was a tall meat tree. They had two chances. They could turn quietly and creep away into the brush, hoping the big beast would not see or hear them. Or, they could make a run for the meat tree--in full view of the guard tower.     CHAPTER SEVEN  _The Rhinosaur Stampede_   The decision was made for them by the rhinosaur. The great scaled beast began to turn around, crashing down brush as he moved. In a few seconds he would be facing directly toward them.  \"Tree,\" Baba clicked very softly. Johnny nodded. The two slinked like hunting cats toward the tree. They didn't dare look back.  \"I think the guard saw us,\" Baba clicked. \"He was waving his arms.\" The jewel bear had already climbed part way up the trunk. He motioned for Johnny to grab the harness.  Not making a sound Johnny took hold of the harness, and the two of them started up the tree. When they reached the first branch, Johnny let go the harness and clambered up as quickly and quietly as he could. Only when they were screened from view by the fleshy leaves of the meat tree did he dare to look down.  Through little openings between the leaves he could see the rhinosaur. It was shaking its ugly horned head. Its little black-blue eyes peered about under blue scaled eyelids. It trumpeted. The deep blasting sound echoed against the settlement walls. For some minutes it moved around in the brush, snorting. It paused, snuffing in air in great gulps. Then it headed straight for the tree and began to trot back and forth under it.  It had smelled Johnny!  Its hoofbeats on the ground made the limb Johnny sat on tremble. If the rhinosaur sensed that Johnny was in the tree it was the end. The tree was easily four feet thick at the base, but a rhinosaur could knock it down with one rush. Johnny and Baba were on the highest and smallest branch, but they were barely twenty feet above its head.  The rhinosaur's shoulder brushed against the lowest branch and the whole tree swayed back and forth as if hit by a hurricane.  Johnny was struck by an idea. \"Baba,\" he whispered, \"do you think it might obey you--just like the arrow-birds?\"  \"I don't know, Johnny,\" Baba clicked softly. \"I'll try.\"  Baba started to climb down. By the slow careful way Baba moved, Johnny knew the little bear was afraid, too. It was an awful chance to take. Johnny was about to call him back, but as he opened his lips, the little bear looked up and grinned.  Down Baba went. He was now halfway down the tree, thirty feet from the ground and level with the eyes of the rhinosaur. It caught sight of him, snorted, and pawed the ground, digging up shovelfuls of dirt with each movement.  \"Friend-pet! Friend-pet!\" Baba clicked and Johnny suddenly wanted to giggle. Imagine having something that size for a pet!  \"Friend-pet!\" Baba clicked again, \"Go away! Go away! Bother us not!\"  The big creature stopped still. Muscles rolled and bunched under the heavy blue-grey scales. Was he going to charge or leave?  They never"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50702"],["title","Venus Boy (#7)"],["body","out.  There was a roar of motors behind the beast, the clank of metal, the deafening blast of an ato-tube gun. The ground shook; leaves showered down on Johnny.  The guards had sent a tank to rescue them!  Things began to happen too fast for Johnny to keep track. The rhinosaur roared with pain and wheeled. It had been hit! It charged toward the oncoming tank--one of the colony's light duty tanks, built for speed and quick turns. The driver jockied for position. The tank shot down the clearing, turned and stopped. Its guns were too light to kill the huge beast, so the gunner did not bother to fire again. They were trying to draw the rhinosaur away from the tree.  The rhinosaur's hooves thundered, echoing against the walls and the rocks as it gathered speed. It was almost on top of the tank. With a roar of the motors the tank shot forward. The rhinosaur was going too fast to stop or turn. It plunged on past the tank, bellowing its rage.  Almost immediately the tank screeched to a stop beneath the tree. Its manhole swung open. Rick Saunders' red head emerged.  \"Get in here! Quick!\" he shouted over the noise of the motor.  Johnny needed no invitation. He was already halfway down the trunk of the tree. Baba jumped from his perch into the open manhole. As soon as Johnny was low enough, he grasped a branch, swung on to the top of the tank, and started down the steel ladder. The tank jumped forward with a lurch.  The rhinosaur was bearing down on them. Their guns roared, but the rhinosaur did not stop. As a hand grabbed him, pulling him inside, Johnny saw the tree topple over as the rhinosaur crashed into it.  \"Fire the gate rocket!\" someone's shout echoed in the tank. Johnny recognized Captain Thompson's deep voice.  \"Check!\" Johnny heard Rick answer. Rick was up in the gun turret.  After the outside light, it seemed very dark in the tank. It smelled of grease and the burnt air of cannon fire. There was the swish of a rocket. Johnny knew this rocket was a signal for the guard on duty at the steel gateways to be ready to open up.  The motors were roaring with a high whining sound which meant they were going at full speed. The tank bounced and jolted, shaking Johnny from side to side.  \"Get ready for the gate!\" warned Captain Thompson from the driver's seat. The tank seemed to be almost flying now. Johnny set himself for a violent turn. Like the doors of the houses, the wall gates were double. Each was a heavy steel portcullis, a great sliding door that could be raised and lowered. When a tank came in the outer gate its weight tripped a switch. That switched turned on motors that made the first gate fall and the second rise. Otherwise fast moving tanks would have smashed into the second gate.  Johnny slid over to an observation slit. To his left he could see that the heavy steel gate was rising. His heart raced. When being chased by rhinosaurs a driver sped straight along the wall and then turned sharply through the open gate. If he timed it right the rhinosaurs plunged on and the tank was safe. It took split second timing.  They were right by the gate. Johnny grabbed a brace. With a scream of the treads, the tank started into a turn.  \"Rhinos on the side!\" shouted Rick. His guns blasted.  Captain Thompson fought to straighten the tank out of the turn. Baba was sitting with his paws over his ears, his claws glowing.  There was a bone-shattering crash.  Then Johnny felt himself flying through the air. Everything went topsy-turvy. He banged his shoulder against the side of the tank. Then he felt Baba's furry body against his. Rick's feet seemed to come from nowhere and dig into his back. Johnny grabbed on to something solid and wedged himself in tight.  The tank was rolling over and over. Something crashed against it again and again. There was a heavy thud and the sound of breaking metal. Then everything was still. The motors had stopped. From outside came the roar of guns and the bellowing of rhinosaurs.  Johnny found himself sprawled on top of Rick Saunders. He was terribly shaken. Baba was hanging onto one of the rungs of the steel ladder. It was almost pitch dark. Rick struggled to his feet as Johnny scrambled from on top of him.  \"We're upside down,\" Baba clicked softly to Johnny.  \"What happened, Saunders?\" Captain Thompson's heavy voice demanded from the driver's compartment. \"Didn't Harkness teach you to shoot?\"  \"Four of them rushed us right at the gate,\" Rick answered. \"Did we make it inside?\"  \"Think so. Anybody hurt?\" Thompson asked.  \"Just scratched a little,\" Johnny answered.  \"Good,\" Captain Thompson grunted. \"Is the righting jack O.K.?\"  Rick tested a lever.  \"O.K.\"  \"Let her rip!\"  \"Hang on, Johnny,\" Rick said. \"We're going to right her.\"  Johnny knew just what was going to happen. A tank turned turtle had meant a dead crew until the righting jack had been attached to each of the tanks. Compressed air pushed out two rods fore and aft and flipped the tank right side up.  Johnny braced himself. There was a rush of air. Johnny felt the tank tip slowly under him. Then it went over with a crash. The tank was right side up.  \"The gate!\" Rick exclaimed.  Just above his head Johnny saw light from the observation slit. He looked out. Then he knew what Rick meant. They and the four rhinosaurs had reached the gate at the same time. The rhinosaurs were inside. They had knocked the tank through the outer gateway and had smashed into the steel door before it was halfway down.  The inner door must have met the same fate for Johnny could see that the sliding steel plates were bent and jammed open. The rhinosaurs had kept after the tank until now it lay fifty yards inside the settlement. Even as Johnny watched, another rhinosaur charged through the opening and headed into the settlement.  Captain Thompson was grinding on the starter and Rick was working up in the gun turret.  \"The rhinosaurs got through,\" Johnny clicked to Baba.  \"And the tank is broken?\" Baba clicked back.  \"Yes.\"  \"I have to get out,\" Baba said. \"Maybe I can get the rhinosaurs to....\"  \"No, Baba,\" Johnny said. \"They're just plain crazy now.\"  Captain Thompson climbed down out of the driver's compartment.  \"The motor's gone. How are the guns?\"  \"Out of action,\" Rick answered. \"Must be filled with dirt. We can't do any good here.\"  \"O.K.,\" Captain Thompson said. \"Let's get moving. I'm needed out there!\"  Rick undid the wing nuts on the manhole and pushed. Metal squeaked, but the door stayed in place.  \"Jammed!\" Rick said. \"Get me a crow bar out of the box.\"  Johnny dived for the tool box and came up with a pry bar. He handed it to Rick.  \"Hurry, man,\" Captain Thompson said as Rick went to work. His black angry eyes fixed themselves on Johnny.  \"We should have left you out there.\"  \"I'm sorry,\" Johnny said.  In answer the man cuffed Johnny with the back of his hand. Johnny couldn't be angry. He knew what a rhinosaur raid was like, and this one was his fault.  \"Oh, leave the kid alone,\" Rick said from above.  \"Leave him alone!\" Thompson snorted, and glared first at Johnny and then at Baba. \"The kid and that bear have caused more trouble....\"  Captain Thompson stopped talking and stared at Baba. He reached out suddenly and grabbed the little bear by the paw.  \"Well, look at this!\" he said in a hushed tone.  In the steamy darkness of the tank Baba's nails shone clear and blue. The climbing and running had worn off all the paint.  Thompson held up Baba's paws into the light of an observation slit. He scraped with one of his finger nails.  \"Nail polish!\" he exclaimed.  The manhole came open with a clang.  \"She's open!\" Rick called.  Captain Thompson paused only a fraction of a second over Baba and climbed the ladder.  \"Lock the kid and bear in the tank,\" Thompson ordered. \"There's less danger here for the boy than there would be in the trip to the wall. You, Rick, go back to the gate. I'll run for headquarters. Make it fast!\" Without another word he was up the ladder and gone.  Rick Saunders reached down and patted Johnny on the shoulder.  \"Tough luck about your bear, son,\" he said, and then he, too, was gone. The manhole door clanged and Johnny heard a lock click into place. He hugged Baba to him.  \"Gosh, Baba,\" Johnny said, \"what are we going to do now?\"  Baba, for once, had nothing to say. Johnny hugged the warm, furry creature closer to him. Tears began to streak down his cheeks. Baba didn't like this. He cocked a blue eye at the boy.  \"Don't cry, Johnny!\" he clicked. \"Come on, stop it!\" he pleaded. \"Why don't we go up in the turret and see what's happening.\"  Johnny wiped his tears away and the two climbed into the gun turret. His stomach tightened. Through the four-inch thick bubble of marvite plastic he could see the destruction he and Baba had let loose. The whole settlement lay within view. A half dozen of the giant lizard beasts had turned, the colony into a dusty hell. Even within the tank the bellows of the beasts and the roar of guns was almost deafening. Most of the marshberry fields had already been trampled in the mud. One of the concrete houses lay crushed into rubble. Johnny was grateful that almost everyone was at the rocket field.  He gave thanks, too, for Captain Thompson. He could see the big man marshaling tanks into an organized row. They were going to try to herd the great beasts out the open gates.  Johnny turned his eyes toward the gates. Someone had manhandled one of the big ato-tube cannons into the opening, pointing it into the jungle. His friend, Rick Saunders, ran up to help. A dying rhinosaur lay not far from the muzzle of the gun. Evidently the other rhinosaurs were too sensible or too frightened to try the power of that cannon.  Baba was pulling at Johnny's sleeve.  \"Look, Johnny, look!\" Baba clicked.  Johnny turned and looked toward the settlement again. A heavy duty hunting tank stood before the settlement stockade and store house. Its heavy cannon spoke once and the door dissolved. Four men leaped from the tank and"]]]
