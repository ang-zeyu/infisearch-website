My  disappointment was so deep and far-reaching it made me ill then they scolded me, and said I had half killed myself carrying that heavy jar in the hot sunshine, although the pain from which I suffered was neither in my arms nor sunburned face.  So I lost my first Cecropia, and from that day until a woman grown and much of this material secured, in all my field work among the birds, flowers, and animals, I never had seen another. They had taunted me in museums, and been my envy in private collections, but find one, I could not.  When in my field work among the birds, so many moths of other families almost had thrust themselves upon me that I began a collection of reproductions of them, I found little difficulty in securing almost anything else. I could picture Sphinx Moths in any position I chose, and Lunas seemed eager to pose for me.  A friend carried to me a beautiful tan-coloured Polyphemus with transparent moons like isinglass set in its wings of softest velvet down, and as for butterflies, it was not necessary  to go afield for them; they came to me. I could pick a Papilio Ajax, that some of my friends were years in securing, from the pinks in my  garden.  A pair of Antiopas spent a night, and waited to be pictured in the morning, among the leaves of my passion vine.  Painted Beauties swayed along my flowered walks, and in September a Viceroy reigned in state on every chrysanthemum, and a Monarch was enthroned on every sunbeam.  No luck was too good for me, no butterfly or moth too rare, except forever and always the coveted Cecropia, and by this time I had learned to my disgust that it was one of the commonest of all.  Then one summer, late in June, a small boy, having an earnest, eager little face, came to me tugging a large box.  He said he had something for me.  He said \"they  called it a butterfly, but he was sure it never was.\"  He was eminently correct.  He had a splendid big Cecropia.  I was delighted.  Of course to have found one myself would have filled my cup to overflowing, but to secure a perfect, living specimen was good enough.  For the first time my childish loss seemed in a measure compensated.  Then, I only could study a moth to my  satisfaction and set it free; now, I could make reproductions so perfect that every antler of its antennae could be counted with the naked eye, and copy its colours accurately, before giving back its liberty.  I asked him whether he wanted money or a picture of it, and as I expected, he said 'money,' so he was paid.  An hour later he came back and said he wanted the picture.  On being questioned as to his change of heart, he said \"mamma told him to say he wanted the picture, and she would give him the money.\"  My sympathy was with her.  I wanted the studies I intended to make of that Cecropia myself, and I wanted them very badly.  I opened the box to examine the moth, and found it so numb with the cold over night, and so worn and helpless, that it could not cling to a leaf or twig.  I tried repeatedly, and fearing that it had been subjected to rough treatment, and soon would be lifeless, for these moths live only a short time, I hastily set up a camera focusing on a branch.  Then I tried posing my  specimen.  Until the third time it fell, but the fourth it clung, and crept down a twig, settling at last in a position that far, surpassed any posing that I could do.  I was very  pleased, and yet it made a complication.  It had gone so far that it might be off the plate and from focus.  It seemed so stupid and helpless that I decided to risk a peep at the glass, and hastily  removing the plate and changing the shutter, a slight but most essential alteration was made, everything replaced, and the bulb caught up. There was only a breath of sound as I turned, and then I stood horrified, for my Cecropia was sailing over a large elm tree in a corner of the orchard, and for a block my gaze followed it skyward, flying like a bird before it vanished in the distance, so quickly had it recovered in fresh air and sunshine.  I have undertaken to describe some very difficult things, but I would not attempt to portray my feelings, and three days later there was no change.  It was in the height of my season of field work, and I had several extremely interesting series of bird studies on hand, and many  miscellaneous subjects.  In those days some pictures were secured that I then thought, and yet feel, will live, but nothing mattered to me.  There was a standing joke among my  friends that I never would be satisfied with my field work until I had made a study  of a 'Ha-ha bird,'  but I doubt if even that specimen would have lifted the gloom of those days.  Everything was a drag, and frequently I would think over it all in detail, and roundly bless myself for taking a prize so rare, to me at least, into the open.  The third day stands lurid in my memory.  It was the hottest, most difficult day of all my years of experience afield.  The temperature ranged from 104  to 108 in the village, and in quarries open to the east, flat fields, and steaming swamps it certainly could have been no cooler.  With set cameras I was working for a shot at a hawk that was feeding on all the young birds and rabbits in the vicinity of its nest.  I also wanted a number of studies to fill a commission that was pressing me. Subjects for several pictures had been found, and exposures made on them when the weather was so hot that the rubber slide of a plate holder would curl like a horseshoe if not laid on a case, and held flat by a camera while I worked.  Perspiration dried, and the landscape took on a sombre black velvet hue, with a liberal sprinkling of gold stars.  I sank into a stupor going home, and an old farmer aroused me, and disentangled my horse from a thicket of wild briers into which it had strayed.  He said most emphatically that if I did not know enough to remain indoors weather like that, my friends should appoint me a 'guardeen.'  I reached the village more worn in body and spirit than I ever had been.  I felt that I could not endure another degree of heat on the back of my head, and I was much discouraged concerning my work. Why not drop it all, and go where there were cool forests and breezes sighing?  Perhaps my studies were not half so good as I thought!  Perhaps people would not care for them!  For that matter, perhaps the editors and publishers never would give the public an opportunity to see my  work at all!  I dragged a heavy load up the steps and swung it to the veranda, and there stood almost paralysed.  On the top step, where I could not reach the Cabin door without seeing it, newly emerged, and slowly exercising a pair of big wings, with every gaudy marking fresh with new life, was the finest Cecropia I ever had seen anywhere.  Recovering myself with a start, I had it under my net that had waited twenty years to cover it!  Inside the door I dropped the net, and the moth crept on my fingers.  What luck!  What extra golden luck!  I almost felt that God had been sorry for me, and sent it there to encourage me to keep on picturing the beauties and wonders of His creations for people who could not go afield to see for themselves, and to teach those who could to protect helpless, harmless things for their use and beauty.  I walked down the hall, and vaguely scanned the solid rows of books and specimens lining the library walls.  I scarcely realized the thought that was in my mind, but what I was looking for was not there.  The dining-room then, with panelled walls and curtains of tapestry?  It was not there!  Straight to the white and gold music room I went.  Then a realizing sense came to me. It was BRUSSELS LACE for which I was searching!  On the most delicate, snowiest place possible, on the finest curtain there, I placed my Cecropia, and then stepped back and gazed at it with a sort of \"Touch it over my dead body\" sentiment in my heart. An effort was required to arouse myself, to realize that I was not dreaming.  To search the fields and woods for twenty  years, and then find the specimen I had sought awaiting me at my own door! Well might it have been a dream, but that the Cecropia, clinging to the meshes of the lace, slowly opening and closing its wings to strengthen them for flight, could be nothing but a delightful reality.  A few days later, in the valley of the Wood Robin, while searching for its nest I found a large cocoon.  It was above my head, but afterward I secured it by means of a ladder, and carried it home. Shortly there emerged a yet larger Cecropia, and luck seemed with me.  I could find them everywhere through June, the time of their emergence, later their eggs, and the tiny caterpillars that hatched from them.  During the summer I found these caterpillars, in different stages of growth, until fall, when after their last moult and casting of skin, they reached the final period of feeding; some were over four inches in length, a beautiful shade of greenish blue, with red and yellow warty projections--tubercles, according to scientific works.  It is easy to find the cocoons these caterpillars spin, because they are the largest woven by any moth, and placed in such a variety of accessible spots.  They can be found in orchards, high on branches, and on water sprouts at the base of trees.  Frequently they are spun on swamp willows, box-elder, maple, or wild cherry.  Mr. Black once found for me the largest cocoon I ever have seen; a pale tan colour with silvery lights, woven against the inside of a hollow log. Perhaps the most beautiful of all, a dull red, was found under the flooring of an old bridge crossing a stream in the heart of the swamp, by a girl not unknown to fiction, who brought it to me.  In a deserted orchard close the Wabash, Raymond once found a pair of empty cocoons at the foot of a big apple tree, fastened to the same twigs, and within two inches of each other.

The contents are:     Foramen Centrale    Theory of Compound Colours    Poinsot's Theory    Address to the Mathematical    Introductory Lecture     On the Unequal Sensibility of the Foramen Centrale to Light of different Colours.  James Clerk Maxwell   [From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]   When observing the spectrum formed by looking at a long ve rtical slit through a simple prism, I noticed an elongated dark spot running up and down in the blue, and following the motion of the eye as it moved _up and down_ the spectrum, but refusing to pass out of the blue into the other colours.  It was plain that the spot belonged both to the eye and to the blue part of the spectrum.  The result to which I have come is, that the appearance is due to the yellow spot on the retina, commonly called the _Foramen Centrale_ of Soemmering.  The most convenient method of observing the spot is by presenting to the eye in not too rapid succession, blue and yellow glasses, or, still better, allowing blue and yellow papers to revolve slowly before the eye.  In this way the spot is seen in the blue.  It fades rapidly, but is renewed every time the yellow comes in to relieve the effect of the blue.  By using a Nicol's prism along with this apparatus, the brushes of Haidinger are well seen in connexion with the spot, and the fact of the brushes being the spot analysed by polarized light becomes evident.  If we look steadily at an object behind a series of bright bars which move in front of it, we shall see a curious bending of the bars as they come up to the place of the yellow spot.  The part which comes over the spot seems to start in advance of the rest of the bar, and this would seem to indicate a greater rapidity of sensation at the yellow spot than in the surrounding retina.  But I find the experiment difficult, and I hope for better results from more accurate observers.     On the Theory of Compound Colours with reference to Mixtures of Blue and Yellow Light.  James Clerk Maxwell   [From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]   When we mix together blue and yellow paint, we obtain green paint. This fact is well known to all who have handled colours; and it is universally admitted that blue and yellow make green.  Red, yellow, and blue, being the primary colours among painters, green is regarded as a secondary colour, arising from the mixture of blue and yellow. Newton, however, found that the green of the spectrum was not the same thing as the mixture of two colours of the spectrum, for such a mixture could be separated by the prism, while the green of the spectrum resisted further decomposition.  But still it was believed that yellow and blue would make a green, though not that of the spectrum.  As far as I am aware, the first experiment on the subject is that of M. Plateau, who, before 1819, made a disc with alternate sectors of prussian blue and gamboge, and observed that, when spinning, the resultant tint was not green, but a neutral gray, inclining sometimes to yellow or blue, but never to green. Prof. J. D. Forbes of Edinburgh made similar experiments in 1849, with the same result.  Prof. Helmholtz of Konigsberg, to whom we owe the most complete investigation on visible colour, has given the true explanation of this phenomenon.  The result of mixing two coloured powders is not by any means the same as mixing the beams of light which flow from each separately.  In the latter case we receive all the light which comes either from the one powder or the other.  In the former, much of the light coming from one powder falls on particles of the other, and we receive only that portion which has escaped absorption by one or other.  Thus the light coming from a mixture of blue and yellow powder, consists partly of light coming directly from blue particles or yellow particles, and partly of light acted on by both blue and yellow particles.  This latter light is green, since the blue stops the red, yellow, and orange, and the yellow stops the blue and violet.  I have made experiments on the mixture of blue and yellow light--by rapid rotation, by combined reflexion and transmission, by viewing them out of focus, in stripes, at a great distance, by throwing the colours of the spectrum on a screen, and by receiving them into the eye directly; and I have arranged a portable apparatus by which any one may see the result of this or any other mixture of the colours of the spectrum.  In all these cases blue and yellow do not make green.  I have also made experiments on the mixture of coloured powders.  Those which I used principally were \"mineral blue\" (from copper) and \"chrome-yellow.\"  Other blue and yellow pigments gave curious results, but it was more difficult to make the mixtures, and the greens were less uniform in tint.  The mixtures of these colours were made by weight, and were painted on discs of paper, which were afterwards treated in the manner described in my paper \"On Colour as perceived by the Eye,\" in the _Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh_, Vol. XXI. Part 2.  The visible effect of the colour is estimated in terms of the standard-coloured papers:--vermilion (V), ultramarine (U), and emerald-green (E).  The accuracy of the results, and their significance, can be best understood by referring to the paper before mentioned.  I shall denote mineral blue by B, and chrome-yellow by Y; and B3 Y5 means a mixture of three parts blue and five parts yellow.         Given Colour.     Standard Colours.

It will be seen that the first admixture of yellow _diminishes_ the brightness of the blue.  The negative values of U indicate that a mixture of V, U, and E cannot be made equivalent to the given colour. The experiments from which these results were taken had the negative values transferred to the other side of the equation.  They were all made by means of the colour-top, and were verified by repetition at different times.  It may be necessary to remark, in conclusion, with reference to the mode of registering visible colours in terms of three arbitrary standard colours, that it proceeds upon that theory of three primary elements in the sensation of colour, which treats the investigation of the laws of visible colour as a branch of human physiology, incapable of being deduced from the laws of light itself, as set forth in physical optics.  It takes advantage of the methods of optics to study vision itself; and its appeal is not to physical principles, but to our consciousness of our own sensations.     On an Instrument to illustrate Poinsot's Theory of Rotation.  James Clerk Maxwell   [From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]   In studying the rotation of a solid body according to Poinsot's method, we have to consider the successive positions of the instantaneous axis of rotation with reference both to directions fixed in space and axes assumed in the moving body.  The paths traced out by the pole of this axis on the _invariable plane_ and on the _central ellipsoid_ form interesting subjects of mathematical investigation. But when we attempt to follow with our eye the motion of a rotating body, we find it difficult to determine through what point of the _body_ the instantaneous axis passes at any time,--and to determine its path must be still more difficult.  I have endeavoured to render visible the path of the instantaneous axis, and to vary the circumstances of motion, by means of a top of the same kind as that used by Mr Elliot, to illustrate precession*.  The body of the instrument is a hollow cone of wood, rising from a ring, 7 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.  An iron axis, 8 inches long, screws into the vertex of the cone.  The lower extremity has a point of hard steel, which rests in an agate cup, and forms the support of the instrument.  An iron nut, three ounces in weight, is made to screw on the axis, and to be fixed at any point; and in the wooden ring are screwed four bolts, of three ounces, working horizontally, and four bolts, of one ounce, working vertically.  On the upper part of the axis is placed a disc of card, on which are drawn four concentric rings.  Each ring is divided into four quadrants, which are coloured red, yellow, green, and blue.  The spaces between the rings are white. When the top is in motion, it is easy to see in which quadrant the instantaneous axis is at any moment and the distance between it and the axis of the instrument; and we observe,--1st. That the instantaneous axis travels in a closed curve, and returns to its original position in the body.  2ndly. That by working the vertical bolts, we can make the axis of the instrument the centre of this closed curve.  It will then be one of the principal axes of inertia. 3rdly. That, by working the nut on the axis, we can make the order of colours either red, yellow, green, blue, or the reverse.  When the order of colours is in the same direction as the rotation, it indicates that the axis of the instrument is that of greatest moment of inertia.  4thly. That if we screw the two pairs of"]]]
