My brother could give us no facts, as he apparently was not in possession of any facts, himself. High up as he was in Nazi inner circles, the Nazis' secret of how they would hold onto occupied countries and still wage war on two other fronts was still a mystery to him. However, it was clear that he hoped to learn that secret soon. In the meantime he was warning us against any hasty action.\"  The Intelligence officer paused to gesture with a hand.  \"High Command followed his warning for the plain reason we are not _yet_ prepared to launch any kind of an invasion of the Continent,\" he said bluntly. \"Not by sea or land, at any rate. And then, a week ago we received a third communication from him. He spoke of a new secret weapon of _defense_ developed by the Nazis. He did not give details, or any kind of a description. He stated only that it was a weapon that guarded the entire coast of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. He said that one General Paul von Peiplow had been placed in complete charge of this secret defense of the occupied countries. He also stated that in his next message he would supply us with complete details of this weapon, and complete information on how to combat and overcome it.\"  Colonel Trevor stopped short and both Dave and Freddy saw the bitterness and sorrow that flooded his face.  \"No other communication was received!\" he said in a heavy voice. \"And ... and you two know what happened today.\"  A sense of eager expectation fizzled out in Dave. He felt cheated and disappointed. He looked at Colonel Trevor and waited for the man to continue talking. However, the Intelligence officer was evidently finished. He slowly drew a cigarette from his pocket case and touched a match to it.  \"Then you have no idea, sir?\" Dave finally ventured the question. \"No idea at all what this new secret weapon might be?\"  \"None,\" Colonel Trevor replied without looking at him. \"We have no idea at all.\"  Dave bit his lips in thoughtful silence, then started to speak but changed his mind and remained silent. Group Captain Ball, watching him, leaned forward.  \"What were you going to say, Dawson?\" he asked. \"Don't be shy, my lad. Anything may be a help, now.\"  Dave hesitated and then shrugged.  \"I was thinking of this von Peiplow, sir,\" he said.  \"Well, what about him?\" the Group Captain pressed.  \"Well, I assume he's still connected with the Luftwaffe, isn't he?\" Dave inquired.  \"Most certainly, and definitely!\" the Air Ministry official replied. \"Von Peiplow is as close to Goering's job as any Nazi will ever get. So, what about it?\"  \"Nothing, sir,\" Dave said slowly, \"except that it gives me the hunch that the secret weapon must have something to do with aircraft, being as how von Peiplow is in full charge.\"  A second of silence hit the group and then Ball broke it by slapping a hand down on his knee.  \"By the gods, yes!\" he cried. \"Yes, I believe you're right, Dawson. It's quite logical, of course, Colonel! What do you think?\"  The Intelligence officer had straightened up a bit in his chair and was staring at Dave with an entirely new light in his eyes. There was a gleam of admiration where there had originally been a sort of bored patience. He smiled slightly and gave a little side twist of his head.  \"I think Dawson has done more correct figuring in the last seven seconds,\" he said, \"then we of Intelligence have done in the last seven days. But that's the way it is at times in this game. A bloke is so busy digging up the mysterious that the obvious passes him right by. Yes, I believe Dawson has got hold of something. And that brings us up to the work you've been doing, Group Captain. Does Dawson's remark change anything?\"  The Air Ministry official scratched the side of his jaw and squinted off into space for a moment or so before giving voice to his thoughts.  \"I don't know,\" he said, \"but I doubt if it does. I've studied those photos until I know every dot and shadow on them by heart. True, we weren't looking for any signs of aeronautical activity, and for that reason perhaps something slipped past us. I doubt it, though. However, the point is, Colonel, as we both agreed, that as of the Twenty-Fifth all photos of Zone K Dash Twenty-Four are obsolete. So I think we can just plain forget them.\"  Colonel Trevor nodded, and said nothing. Dave waited for perhaps three seconds, and then he couldn't stand being in the dark any longer.  \"What photos, Group Captain Ball?\" he blurted out. \"And where is Zone K Dash Twenty-Four located? I don't believe I've ever heard of that zone, sir?\"  The Air Ministry official grunted and settled himself more comfortably in his chair.  \"Well, you're going to hear about it now,\" he said with a quick side glance at Squadron Leader Markham. \"Through a slight mistake a certain order of mine was sent to this Squadron instead of the Squadron for which it was originally intended. However, I regard that as a bit of good fortune, rather than bad, because when Squadron Leader Markham told me of the mistake over the phone I suddenly realized that I would much rather have this Squadron tackle the job. Just a minute, now, while I light my pipe.\"  As the Air Ministry official produced pipe, tobacco, and matches, Dave noticed that Squadron Leader Markham looked far from happy. As a matter of fact, the O.C. of Eighty-Four looked downright annoyed at Group Captain Ball. However, he said nothing and watched in silence while the senior officer lighted up his hand carved \"stove.\"     CHAPTER SIX  _Pilots' Plans_   \"There we are!\" Group Captain Ball said and tossed the fourth or fifth burnt match into the ash tray on Markham's desk. \"Now, about those photo patrols. Well, when we learned that Jerry had developed some new secret weapon that could guard Europe's coastline from the tip of the Netherlands to the south of France, we got to work to find out what it could be. Naturally, the first step was to take pictures from the air. Pictures, and more pictures, until we had found some kind of a clue. Then we would concentrate upon that particular area, and try to learn more.  \"Well, under my direction, at least thirty picture patrols a day were made to various points along the entire coastline. Light bombers and reconnaisance planes took the pictures. And a fighter unit or two went along as escort and protection. There were air scrambles, of course, on every patrol. We suffered a slight loss in pilots and planes, but we did get our pictures. Well, for the first few days those pictures told us absolutely nothing that we didn't already know. Then it suddenly became very apparent that there was something going on in Zone K Dash Twenty-Four. That Zone, for your information, extends from Dunkirk to Ostende, to Calais, to Boulogne, to Dieppe. In other words, the strip of Occupied France shoreline closest to the British Isles. There the photos told us that changes were being made every day. Pictures taken on two successive days simply didn't match up with each other at all. Gun implacements were different, ammo depots and the like were all changed around, anti-aircraft battery posts, and signs of troops and motorized unit movements were different. In other words, the whole blasted length of shoreline, and inland for fifteen miles or more, was a different kind of a jumble from day to day.\"  The Air Ministry official paused, frowned at his dead pipe, and pulled out some more matches. Dave started to ask a question, hesitated a second, and Freddy Farmer beat him to it.  \"That sounds like the Jerries were on to you, sir,\" he said quietly. \"I mean, that they mussed up things on purpose so that you couldn't make out head nor tail of what was going on in that Zone.\"  Group Captain Ball blew a cloud of thick smoke toward the ceiling, smiled at Freddy, and nodded.  \"Good lad, Farmer,\" he said. \"That's exactly the way we figured it. We decided definitely that they were playing a bit of a game with us. Pulling our leg, you know. And then we got pictures on the Twenty-Fifth. That was three days ago. They were the most mystifying of the lot. Every blessed one of them showed definite signs that the Zone had been completely evacuated. Yes, sir! Completely evacuated. Even the pilots taking part in the picture patrol reported they saw no signs of occupancy. True, they were at altitude, and the Jerry planes, of course, were there to give them trouble. But what little opportunity they did have to observe the terrain below resulted in nothing of value. Eye witnesses and photographs assured us that the German forces had just up and cleared out.\"  The Air Ministry office made a faint motion with his hand, and snorted softly.  \"Naturally we suspected some kind of a trick at once,\" he continued in a moment. \"We knew, perfectly well that Hitler wasn't going to up and walk away from ground that had cost him so much in men and guns. No, not that greedy one! No, it was obvious that they had simply dug places where they could hide during the day, and did their work, whatever it was, during the night. And so we made arrangements to top them on that little game.\"  Group Captain Ball cut off the last short and stared fixedly at his pipe. It had gone out again, but it was plain that he was not even conscious of the fact. His thoughts were on something completely removed from his hand carved stove. To Dave and Freddy the senior officer's face seemed to suddenly age a dozen years or more. His shoulders sagged slightly, and his lips were pressed tightly together in a grimace of bitter self-reproach. Then presently he lifted his head and got his shoulders back.  \"I'd give my life if I could recall that order,\" he said in a husky voice. \"The order was for the light bomber-photo planes to go over at night, as though on a bombing mission. When they were over their objective they were to release"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50400"],["title","Dave Dawson, Flight Lieutenant (#7)"],["body"," new powerful magnesium flares used nowadays for night photography. They were to dive, catch those on the ground by surprise, and take their pictures.\"  \"The pictures still showed evidence of complete evacuation, sir?\" Freddy Farmer put the question when the Air Ministry official stopped and didn't go on.  \"There were no pictures,\" the man said harshly.  \"No pictures, sir?\" Dave echoed. Then as a wild guess, \"Oh, you mean the patrol was washed-out?\"  Group Captain Ball turned his head and stared at him out of eyes filled with sorrow.  \"I mean that the patrol was _wiped out_!\" he said in a heavy voice. \"Not a single plane or pilot returned to base. Ten Lockheed Hudsons and not a one of them has been heard from since. They all just completely disappeared!\"  The senior officer stopped abruptly and a tingling silence settled over the interior of the Squadron Office. Dave wanted to say something, but he could not think of the right words. A lump of lead was rolling around inside his stomach, and the palms of his hands had suddenly become strangely hot and clammy. Ten Lockheed Hudsons roaring out over the Channel, and on into complete and utter oblivion? It wasn't a pleasant thought. It was the sort of thing that seemed to drain the blood from a fellow's body, and dumped ice cubes on his brain, no matter how many times he had personally battled with death. The known you could always take. It was the unknown, the eerie, and the mysterious that cut your heart up into small pieces, and clawed your nerves to shreds.  \"No report at all on what happened, sir?\" Dave presently asked, though he knew full well what the answer would be.  \"No, none at all,\" Group Captain Ball replied without looking at him. \"The patrol took off, and never came back.\"  \"I might add,\" Colonel Trevor spoke up quietly, \"that Intelligence H.Q. contacted every one of its agents in the Occupied Zones. That is, all whom it was possible to contact. Not one of them could give us a satisfactory explanation.\"  \"I say!\" Freddy Farmer suddenly gasped, and then instantly subsided into silence.  Group Captain Ball swiveled around in his chair and shot the English youth a keen look.  \"You say, what?\" he demanded. \"You've just thought of something?\"  Freddy started to shake his head, and then to Dave's surprise he shot a guilty look at Squadron Leader Markham. Eighty-Four's O.C. took the look with a puzzled frown.  \"What now, Farmer?\" he asked. \"Your face has a bit of a telltale expression, you know. Spoke out of turn, eh?\"  \"In a way, sir, I guess,\" Freddy said with an apologetic smile. \"Never thought I'd mention it, but.... Well, after all that's been said, perhaps I'd better mention it.\"  \"If it has a bearing on our present problem,\" Group Captain Ball said sharply, \"I'm giving you an order to mention it! And jolly well right now!\"  The English youth stared at him and nodded meekly.  \"Of course, sir,\" he said. Then, \"It was two nights ago ... Tuesday night ... the photo patrol took off and never returned?\"  \"That's correct,\" the Air Ministry official said with a curt nod. \"Tuesday night.\"  \"That Zone covers quite a bit of ground, sir,\" Freddy said next. \"Naturally, the patrol didn't expect to photo the entire area. Do you happen to know what their main objective was? I mean, the exact location?\"  \"Certainly I do!\" the Group Captain snapped in an annoyed tone. \"The area between Boulogne and Lille. Day to day changes there had attracted our interest the most. We.... Now what? What the devil, Farmer? You're turning pale as a blasted ghost. For Heaven's sake, what's on your mind, lad?\"  Freddy gulped, swallowed hard, and shot another guilty look at Squadron Leader Markham.  \"You won't like this, sir,\" he said, \"but I'd better tell it now. Last Tuesday night I took up one of the night flying planes for a little test hop about the field. You remember, sir?\"  \"I do,\" the Squadron Leader said, and fixed him with a hard stare. \"You were up almost three hours. Matter of fact, I've been meaning to tell you to make your night test hops shorter in future. I know that was a special plane with extra tanks to permit lengthy practice. But three hours is too long. Yes, I remember. So what about it?\"  \"I did not make my test hop within sight of the field, sir,\" Freddy said as his face turned a bit red. \"Fact is.... Well, I sort of went hunting for trouble. I mean.... Well, I came across a flight from our Bomber Command on its way over to Naziland. I tagged along hoping that a Jerry night fighter or two would come up once they reached the other side of the Channel.\"  \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" Squadron Leader Markham breathed as Freddy faltered. \"Remind me to make an example of you to the rest of the Squadron, my lad. Lots of pilots have been jolly well broken out of Service for less.\"  \"Yes, I know, sir,\" Freddy said in a crestfallen tone. \"I was a perfect idiot.\"  \"You were completely balmy!\" the Squadron Leader growled. \"But never mind that for the present. Did night fighters come up after the bombers?\"  \"No, sir!\" Freddy said, brightening a little. \"There wasn't a single bit of action. Not even anti-aircraft guns or searchlights. I tagged the patrol a bit farther inland, and then turned back and headed for home. I had almost reached the Jerry side of the Channel when there was what seemed to be a terrific explosion to my southeast. The whole earth seemed to explode fire and smoke. It was miles from my position yet the glare actually blinded me for an instant. Then the light died down to a reddish glow in the distance. But, I didn't go and investigate, sir.\"  \"Blessed wonder you didn't!\" Squadron Leader Markham said, and hid a faint smile by wiping his mouth with his hand. \"You figured the spot where the explosion occurred, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Freddy replied instantly. \"From my own position I judged it to be about half way between Boulogne and Lille. I didn't go and investigate because I assumed that it was the bombers I had tagged blasting some Jerry ammo dump, or something. So I just came on back home, and landed. Sorry, sir, but.... Well, I thought it best I tell you, considering.\"  \"Well, fessing up may help you a little,\" Markham grunted. \"Doesn't excuse your being a crazy idiot, though.\"  Freddy started to apologize again, but checked it as Colonel Trevor leaned toward him.  \"The location of that explosion, Farmer!\" he said sharply. \"You are sure of it? Positive?\"  \"Oh quite, sir,\" the English youth assured him. \"Fact is, the blinking glare lighted up some landmarks that I recognized easily. But, as I say, it was probably those bombers of ours giving a Jerry ammo dump, or rail-head, a good drubbing.\"  \"It wasn't!\" Group Captain Ball cut in with a violent shake of his head. \"The Bomber Command received very definite orders not to send a single unit over that area Tuesday night. It was to be left strictly alone so that the photo patrol planes would be able to work unhindered. No, none of our bombers were over that point Tuesday night.\"  \"By the way, Farmer,\" Colonel Trevor got in quickly. \"Did you happen to note the time of the explosion, by any chance?\"  The English youth pursued his lips and squinted his eyes at the office wall in a mannerism of deep and concentrated thought. After a moment he sat up a bit straighter and nodded.  \"Yes, of course, I did, sir!\" he replied. \"I distinctly remember glancing at the instrument board watch. I remember because I was flying with all dash lights out, and the glare of the explosion was bright enough for me to see the time. It was exactly twenty-seven minutes before midnight, sir!\"  Colonel Trevor slowly let clamped air from his lungs, leaned back in his chair and looked at Group Captain Ball. The Air Ministry official returned the look and slowly nodded his head up and down as though it were hinged in the middle.  \"Yes,\" he said as though talking to himself, \"that time would just about put the photo patrol over their first objective. Yes, that explosion, or whatever it was ... must have been the end of those brave chaps. Blast this war! Blast me for issuing that order!\"  No one said anything for a moment or two after the senior officer stopped speaking. Then Colonel Trevor spoke to Freddy again.  \"You'd better go into detail on that little off the record night flight you made, Farmer,\" he said. \"Did anything else happen? See anything else that didn't seem quite right to you?\"  The English youth went into his thinking act again, and came out of it shrugging his shoulders.  \"No, sir,\" he said. \"Can't say, that there was anything else. It did seem a bit strange, though, that Jerry ground gunners and searchlight lads didn't do anything about that bomber flight passing over. And, of course, there wasn't a thing done about me when I returned back over the Channel. Quiet as could be, and twice as dark below. Fact is, I don't recall spotting a single light on the ground. But, of course, that's not unusual. Jerry knows quite a bit about black-out technique, too.\"  Colonel Trevor nodded, said nothing, and fell to studying his fingernails some more. Dave waited for somebody to say something, and when the silence continued he offered his suggestion to Group Captain Ball.  \"If it hasn't already been made, sir,\" he said, \"why not have a daylight photo patrol made over that area?\"  \"I thought of that,\" the Air Ministry official replied with a nod. \"In fact I had arranged for a patrol to be made. Only....\"  The senior officer paused and smiled at Squadron Leader Markham.  \"Only the arrangements went haywire,\" he said. \"My orders came here instead of going to another Squadron. However, as I've already said, I consider that fortunate rather than unfortunate. Frankly, I'd rather have Eighty-Four tackle the job.\"  \"There's nothing particularly hard about escort work, sir,\" Markham spoke up quietly. \"In my opinion any squadron in the Fighter Command is just as good as the next.\"  \"Don't be modest, Markham!\" Group Captain Ball said with a chuckle. \"I"]]]
