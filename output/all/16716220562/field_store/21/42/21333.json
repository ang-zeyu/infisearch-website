They probably ran into a big bunch of seaweed.\"  He bit into a sandwich. The two engineers, with complete democracy, were already eating. The man at the controls suddenly uttered an exclamation.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Davis quickly.  \"Look out the window,\" said the pilot in a tone indicating that he could not believe his eyes.  Davis looked, and his month dropped partly open. Before them the white patch of light had turned golden and then yellow. A bank of clouds lay before them, behind which the sun was evidently hidden.  That had not caused Davis' exclamation, however. He was not amazed at anything he saw, but at the lack of something he did not see--the ocean. The cloud bank was illuminated by the sun. It covered half of the sky before them, _and below them_!  There was no ocean below them. There was no land below them. Above, the rapidly graying sky could be seen. Below them was rapidly graving sky! There was no horizon, there was no land, there was no sea.  There was only sky. They seemed to be alone in an illimitable firmament, a derelict in open space, adrift in some unthinkable ether in which there was no landing space or any solid thing except themselves.  Above them and below them, before them and behind them, on their right side and their left side was sky, and nothing but sky. There was not one bit of solid matter visible on either side, ahead or behind, up or down.  It was as if they had gone aloft, and while they flew the earth had been destroyed. Only the incredibility of such a catastrophe kept them from believing it instantly.  \"Teddy,\" said Davis in a moment or two, trying to jest, though his voice was shaking, \"you're our tame scientist. What's happened to our well-beloved earth? Has it gone off and left us in the lurch? Have we flown off into space?\"  Gerrod was looking with all his eyes. He looked down into a blue bowl that was the exact counterpart of the dome above.  \"Which way is down?\" he asked quietly. \"Is it that way, or that way?\" He pointed over his head and at his feet. \"Are we flying right side up, or upside down, or what?\"  The plane banked sharply and side-slipped for a moment before it recovered.  \"Steady!\" said Davis to the man at the controls. \"Steady----\"  The machine banked again, then shot upward, stalled, and slipped on again.  \"Straighten out!\" said Davis sharply. \"Up with the joy stick!\"  \"I don't know what's what,\" said the white-faced pilot desperately, obeying as he spoke. \"Great God! What's happening now?\"  The plane seemed to be standing on its tail, and the three men standing in the car slid toward the rear. Davis seized a seat and clambered toward the controls. As he made his way toward the instruments the plane seemed to go mad.  It twisted, turned, stood upon its head and darted forward, and then seemed to be wallowing in the air. Davis seized the controls, and with his eye solely on the inclinometer worked madly for a moment. The plane stopped its antics and drove on steadily.  \"It's like driving in a fog,\" he said over his shoulder. \"All right back there now?\"  \"Yes.\" Gerrod was answering. \"What happened?\"  \"With nothing to tell which was up and which down, we lost our level and couldn't find it again. I've flown upside down for five minutes, going through a cloud, and didn't know it until my barometer dropped upward. We're all right, but what's happened to the earth?\"  Gerrod cautiously made his way to a point beside Davis, who was driving with his eyes glued to the instruments. That incredible vastness into which the machine seemed to be boring was appalling. They seemed to be speeding madly from nothingness into nothingness, with nothing below them and nothing above.  They were alone in a universe of air. Gerrod stared ahead at the cloud bank behind which the sun seemed to be hiding.  \"There's the sun, all right. What's our barometer reading?\"  \"Eight thousand feet.\"  \"Try dipping, by the inclinometer.\"  Davis did so. Though there was not the slightest change in the appearance of the sky that compassed them all about, the barometer quivered from eight thousand feet to seven, and then to six. Gerrod suddenly uttered an exclamation:  \"The sun's coming out!\"  The fiery disk of the sun peered slowly from behind the edge of the cloud bank.  \"There's _another_!\"  From the opposite side of the cloud bank a second sun could be seen, slowly appearing as had the first. The two suns swam away from the fringe of the cloud and glared at each other.  \"I've got it!\" Gerrod struck his knee with his hand. \"What fools we are!\"  \"I'm glad we're only fools,\" said Davis mildly. \"I've been afraid we had gone mad. What's happened?\"  \"Why, the water,\" Gerrod said excitedly, \"the water is perfectly calm and reflects like a mirror. We don't see the sky below us. We see the reflection of the sky. And that isn't a second sun,\" he pointed; \"that's the reflection of the sun.\"  \"Only, the water doesn't reflect like that,\" said Davis. \"At least, not from straight overhead. Open a side window and look directly downward.\"  Gerrod did so, and exclaimed again:  \"I'm right, I tell you! Directly under us I can see the reflection of our plane, flying upside down.\"  Davis took a quick glance.  \"I guess you are right, after all,\" he admitted, \"but the water doesn't reflect like that normally. Something queer must have happened.\" He was silent a moment, while his eyes swept the distance before them keenly. \"Here's another proof you're right. There's the yacht we're looking for.\"  Far away, its white hull turned to red gold by the first rays of the sun, they saw the yacht, motionless on the water. And in striking corroboration of Gerrod's hypothesis, they saw every line and every spar reflected in the water below.  Davis shifted his course to bear for the yacht and dipped down until he was only five hundred feet above the strange, mirrorlike surface of the sea. Below them they could see the spreading wings of their seaplane reflected from the still water.  They swept up to the yacht and circled above it. The junior pilot unshipped the tiny wireless set of the aëroplane, and it crackled busily for a few moments.  \"All right to alight,\" he reported. \"They say nothing has happened all night, but they're still unable to move.\"  The plane swept around the yacht in a wide circle, coming lower and lower. It was quite impossible to judge where the surface of the water might be, but Davis kept his eye on the deck of the yacht, to get the level from that.  At last he made his decision. Being quite unable to tell exactly where the surface was, he could not land in the usual fashion. He slowed in mid-air until the machine was moving at the lowest speed at which it would keep aloft.  Then, by a jerk of the joy stick, he headed it upward at an angle it was unable to make at that speed. The result was that the machine stalled precisely like a motor car on an upgrade and, with next to no headway, \"pancaked,\" sank vertically--downward.  \"Sit tight!\" he ordered as the plane sank.  Next moment every one of them clutched wildly at the nearest object to keep himself from falling. The plane had struck the surface, but instead of skimming forward, as its slight remaining headway made it try to do, it was brought to a sudden standstill as if by a mighty brake.  Only a miracle kept it from overturning. Davis opened a window of the cabin and shouted:  \"Throw us a rope and haul us alongside!\"  The men on the deck of the yacht heard him, and a rope came hurtling through the air, to fall across one of the wings. Davis scrambled out and made it fast. Those on the yacht hauled, but the plane did not move. Half a dozen men grasped the slender line and threw their united weight upon it. The rope broke with a snap.  \"What the----\" exclaimed Davis in astonishment.  A second rope was thrown. The captain of the yacht called from the bridge:  \"Haul a heavy line to you and make that fast!\"  Wondering, those on the seaplane obeyed. The sailors on the yacht made the other end of the stouter line fast to a capstan and manned it. Slowly and reluctantly the seaplane was drawn toward the white vessel.  It was Gerrod who looked behind them. Where the float of the seaplane had been he saw a deep depression in the surface of the water, which, as he watched, slowly filled.  \"The sea is turned to jelly!\" he exclaimed, and he was right.  They found the truth of the matter when they clambered on board the yacht. With the morning, the members of the crew were able to make a more thorough investigation of what had happened.  They lowered boats, and the boats stuck fast. When oars were dipped into the strangely whitened or silvered water the oars were drawn out coated with a sticky, silvery mass of a jellylike substance.  From the deck of the yacht the altered appearance of the sea was as remarkable as from the air. All of the ocean seemed to have been changed to a semisolid mass of silver.  The horizon had vanished or ended into the sky imperceptibly so it could not be distinguished. The captain discussed the matter with them.  \"I've never seen anything like this before,\" he said perplexedly. \"I've been on a ship that traveled two hundred miles on a milk sea, but never anything like this.\"  \"What do you think it is?\" asked Davis. \"Something on the order of a milk sea?\"  The captain nodded.  \"You know a milk sea is caused by a multitude of little animals that color the water milky white. They're phosphorescent at night. This must be something on that order, only these cluster together until the water is made into a jelly. And they have a queer, slimy smell.\"  \"They aren't phosphorescent,\" said Davis.  \"No, of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50622"],["title","The Silver Menace (#3)"],["body"," not.\"  Nita Morrison had joined the little group. Her father was beside her, looking rather worried.  \"Well,\" said Nita anxiously, \"what's to be done? How are we going to get the yacht free?\"  \"I'm afraid we aren't,\" said Davis, smiling. \"The telegraphed orders that brought me here told me simply to make an examination and make a report. My plane can't do anything for the yacht, of course.\"  \"Then what----\"  \"I'll go back and report,\" Davis explained, \"and they'll send boats to try to get in to you people. There doesn't seem to be any immediate danger, and at worst you can all be taken off by aëroplane, if we can rise again from that jelly mess.\"  Nita wrinkled her small nose.  \"I know we aren't in danger,\" she said, \"or at least I know it now, but are we going to have to stay here and smell that horrid smell until the government gets ready to rescue us?\"  The odor of the jellylike animalcules was far from pleasant. It was an unclean scent, as of slime dredged from the bottom of the sea.  \"Well-l,\" said Davis thoughtfully, \"I dare say we can accommodate two more people. It isn't quite regular, but that's a detail.\"  \"But the crew?\" Morrison looked inquiringly at the captain of the yacht.  \"Milk seas always break up, sir,\" said the captain. \"I have no doubt this silver sea will break up as well. We can wait and see, and at worst we have our wireless.\"  \"Then it's settled,\" said Nita joyfully. From sheer gratitude she smiled at Davis.  \"Always providing we can get aloft again,\" said Davis.  \"The propellers of the ship, sir,\" suggested the captain, \"though they can't move the yacht, yet manage to thrash a fair-sized patch of this jelly into liquid.\"  \"A good idea,\" said Davis heartily. \"We'll haul the plane around to the stern, and you'll set your engines running.\"  In a very little time this was done. The great propellers of the yacht thrashed mightily, and a narrow patch of open water opened in the silver sea. The seaplane was laboriously hauled around to the stern of the yacht, and the party was lowered on board.  With some difficulty the motors were cranked again and the plane scuttled madly down the lane of water. With a quick jerk of the joy stick Davis lifted the plane from the water just as the open water ended and the silver sea began.  The big plane circled in the air, rising steadily as it circled, and at last headed for the west again, still flying in that incredible appearance of sky above and sky below, with the reflected sun glaring upward just as fiercely as the real sun beat down.     III.   Nita sat in the seat beside Davis' control chair, pointing to the instruments one by one.  \"And that's the inclinometer,\" she repeated, \"to tell you the angle at which the plane is climbing or descending. That's the barometer, which reads--let me see--seventy-four hundred feet. We're over a mile high, aren't we?\"  \"We are,\" said Davis, \"though by the looks of things we are ten thousand miles from anywhere.\"  The silver sea was still beneath them, and they still seemed to be floating in a universe of air. Nita paid no attention.  \"And that's the compass dial, and that----What did you call it?\"  \"An anenometer,\" said Davis again, smiling. \"It's the speedometer of the air--or the patent log, whichever you like to call it.\"  \"You only have to learn one syllable,\" said Nita. \"They all end in ometer. It's convenient that they're named like that.\"  Davis smiled.  \"I never thought of that before, but it is convenient.\"  \"But how do you balance the plane?\" Nita demanded.  \"In straightaway flight it balances itself,\" Davis explained. \"It's one of the new inherently stable designs. For turning, the wing tips work automatically. We've a gyroscopic affair that attends to them.\"  Nita subsided for a moment, then demanded further information.  \"What's that lever for? To change speeds?\"  Davis laughed.  \"Well, no. We haven't but one speed forward and no reverse----\"  \"You're making fun of me!\"  \"That's the joy stick,\" said Davis, chuckling. \"We dive and climb with it. Pull it back and we go up. Push it forward and we dive.\"  \"Mmmmm,\" said Nita interestedly.  Her father took his cigar out of his mouth long enough to join in Davis' chuckle at Nita's absorbed air.  \"Don't talk to the motorman, Nita,\" he said. \"He may run past a switch.\"  Nita turned around and smiled at him. The car was rather crowded with seven people in it. Gerrod was looking curiously at a bit of the silvery jelly, with which he had filled several pails before leaving the yacht. He took a bit of it between his thumb and forefinger and rolled it back and forth speculatively.  It seemed faintly granular to the touch, but at the slightest pressure underwent a change that felt like crumbling, and was nothing but watery liquid.  \"I'll bet anything you care to name,\" he said thoughtfully, \"that this is just a mass of little animalcules with little silvery shells. The silvery shells would account for the reflection we see.\"  \"The captain of my yacht,\" observed Morrison, \"said that he thought it was like a milk sea. That's a mass of little animals that glow like phosphorus in the dark.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Gerrod meditatively. \"I'd like to look at this stuff under a microscope.\"  \"Oh some of it will go to the government chemists,\" said Morrison with a large air, \"and they'll figure out a way to kill the little beasts. There's a cure for everything.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Gerrod.  The plane flew on steadily, Davis finding some amusement in gratifying Nita's suddenly aroused curiosity about every part of the seaplane. When her curiosity about the plane was satisfied, however, and she began to make inquiries about himself, Davis was much less comfortable.  He tried to be evasive, but she pinned him down, and was filled with excitement when she found that he was the same man who, as Lieutenant Davis, had flown the two-seated flying machine that had destroyed the Black Flyer and with it Varrhus' menace to the liberty of the world.  She tried very hard indeed to get him to tell her the story of that fight, but he blushed and said there was nothing to tell. It would be hard to say to what lengths she would have gone had not something outside the plane caught her attention.  \"There's the horizon!\" she exclaimed. \"We've come to the edge of the silver sea, and from here on it's just the plain, good, old-fashioned ocean.\"  The line that marked the point where sea and sky joined was indeed visible, and a gradually widening bank of darker blue showed that the silver sea had indeed come to an end.  As the seaplane flew onward the darker, wave-tossed ocean came toward them and passed below, but blended so gradually with the jellied ocean that it was impossible to tell where the silver sea ended and blue water began. It was evident that the silver sea was still growing.  Then, for a long time, the seaplane sped onward over the blue waters, while Nita tried ingeniously to extract from Davis the details of the fight with the Black Flyer.  Davis was acutely uncomfortable, but nevertheless he felt strangely disappointed when the dim line of the coast appeared ahead. He hovered a moment to get his bearings, and then sped northward toward the aviation station to which he was attached.  Nita, too, seemed disappointed. She had enjoyed tormenting Davis, and he impressed her very favorably. After the plane had swooped downward and come to rest on the water a scant two hundred yards from the hangar in which it was kept, she turned to Davis.  \"Well,\" she announced, \"since I haven't been able to make you tell me what I want to know this time I warn you I shall make you tell me next time.\"  Davis smiled.  \"May I hope there will be a next time?\"  Nita smiled at him.  \"I shall be angry if there isn't,\" she said demurely.  The launch came up to tow them ashore, and Davis was busy for a few moments, but before Nita and her father climbed into the motor car they had commandeered to take them to the city he found time to make a more definite arrangement and learned he was expected to call at the Morrison mansion \"very, very soon.\"  The description of the silver sea aroused but little attention in the newspapers. A particularly pathetic murder trial was filling the public mind, and small paragraphs in obscure corners, describing the plight of the yacht, contained all that the public learned.  Every one seemed to dismiss the matter as a natural curiosity which would probably disappear in a little while. An aggregation of tiny animalcules which had clustered together until they formed a jellylike mass did not promise much in the way of drama, and our newspapers are essentially purveyors of drama.  Obscure notices in the shipping news, however, told of the growth of the silvery patch, and at last there was a ripple of interest caused by the news that the crew of the yacht claimed that the jellylike creatures were clambering up the sides of the ship and threatening to overwhelm the vessel.  Seaplanes put out from shore and took the crew off, and then public interest lapsed again. An almost uneventful accident to the yacht of a steamship magnate was good material for society news, but not for the pages devoted to items of general interest.  To Davis, however, anything pertaining to Nita had become of surpassing interest. He practically haunted her house, and Nita seemed not at all unwilling to have him there. Her father was as cordial as Nita at first, but later began to watch Davis' frequent appearances with something of disquiet.  Davis was sufficiently well known from his Black Flyer episode to be considered socially eligible anywhere, but he was far from rich. He had consistently refused the numerous offers from motion-picture companies and book publishers to enact or relate his exploits, though the acceptance of any of those offers would have meant a small fortune.  Davis was instinctively unwilling to commercialize his reputation. Morrison could find no fault with him personally, but he could not quite"]]]
