Don't worry, I won't bite you.\"  Dave flushed to the roots of his hair and heartily wished there were a hole in the floor into which he could jump.  \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he managed to stammer. \"You see--well, Farmer and I have been going around in circles ever since we left England. And--well, it's sort of caught us off balance, if you know what I mean.\"  \"I understand perfectly,\" the U. S. Intelligence chief said kindly. \"Coming here must make a fellow feel he is acting out one of those crazy pulp paper thrillers. You know: secret doors, and special code-words. Well, we're not as bad as that. However, we find it does help to play just a little on the mysterious side. These are the offices we use when we have work to do. Those over in the War Department Building are just for show. Fact is, I personally would go crazy with all the silly trimmings they have over there. But pardon me. I want you to meet my comrades in this daffy business.\"  Colonel Welsh turned and led them over to a desk so big that it could have easily been cut up into five desks of the usual size. Three men were seated at the desk, and they pushed up from their chairs as the Colonel and the two youths approached.  \"Captain Lamb,\" the Colonel said, pointing to a chunky redhead. \"Next to him, Captain Stacey. And that chap who's as thin as I am is Lieutenant Caldwell, our coding expert. Gentlemen, Flight Lieutenants Dawson and Farmer.\"  Dave and Freddy shook hands with the other officers, and then dropped into chairs the Colonel pulled up. It was not until then that Dave had an opportunity to take a good look about him, and what he saw set his blood to tingling through his veins, and his heart to pounding against his ribs. He had often been inside the inner offices of British Intelligence, and on each occasion he had been stunned by the number of gadgets of all sorts, and the vast array of equipment they were used to operate. But the stuff he stared at now put the British equipment in the shade. There was every conceivable piece of equipment from ultra-ray flashlights to giant X-ray machines. One whole wall was lined with telephones and short wave radios for both sending and receiving. And along another wall was a row of file cabinets that operated electrically. One had only to push a file button, and the correct drawer slid open and the exact file folder shot up out of its clamps. In truth, Dave believed that Colonel Welsh had at his fingertips complete information of everyone of importance in the war, and that within a matter of seconds he could establish contact with any one of his agents, no matter in what part of the globe he might be. And those two items were but two of the many, many things that could be made possible with the equipment in that huge room. It was like the mechanical wizardry of Scotland Yard and the F.B.I. all set up in the same room.  \"Interesting stuff, isn't it, Dawson?\"  Dave turned his head to see Colonel Welsh grinning at him. He blushed slightly, and nodded.  \"It certainly is, sir,\" he said politely. \"A fellow could have some fun in this place.\"  \"Depends on what you call fun,\" the Intelligence officer said with a grimace. \"There's been more than one death warrant issued from this place. However, you're not here to be taught how to handle this stuff. Matter of fact, though, I suppose you're wondering just why you are here, eh?\"  \"Decidedly, sir!\" Freddy Farmer fairly exploded the words.  \"And how!\" Dave echoed. \"If I don't find out something, and soon, I'm going to dive right out a window, and end it all. For three days, sir, Farmer and I have been living a crazy, cockeyed dream. Maybe it's a nightmare, I don't know. But if you can possibly give us an inkling what it's all about, then consider me down on my knees and begging you to do just that! Honest! I don't know whether I'm coming or going.\"  The Colonel and the others joined in a loud laugh, and then presently the senior officer's face grew serious.  \"You're here at my request, frankly,\" he said. \"Here because I feel that you're just the men we need to help us crack a few tough nuts. Among those who came over with Prime Minister Churchill last December was General Sir John Gately, chief of all British Intelligence. Perhaps you know him?\"  \"Only of him, sir,\" Dave replied. \"I never had the pleasure of meeting him. A wonderful man, though.\"  \"The very best England has,\" Freddy Farmer added. \"I've never had the chance to meet him, either.\"  \"Yes, Sir John is just about the best in England,\" Colonel Welsh said with a firm nod. \"We had several talks together, and he struck me as being just about the most brilliant man I ever met. He has certainly made it hot more than once for Herr Himmler's Gestapo boys. Well, to get to the point, I talked over with him a plan I had in mind. After a moment's thought he stated that you two were the type of men that I need. Fact is, he said you were _the_ two I needed. So there's a mighty fine compliment for you. And let me hasten to add that it's a compliment well deserved, in my opinion. This is the first time I've met you, but your accomplishments in England and Libya and in the Far East are no secrets to this office.\"  Dave laughed embarrassedly and glanced at Freddy Farmer.  \"It was mostly Farmer, sir!\" he said. \"I usually went along just for the ride.\"  \"Rot!\" Freddy snorted, red-faced. \"More often than not it was I who blundered us right up a tree, and you got us out of the mess. Stop being modest, my lad. You're in your own country, you know.\"  \"I'm pretty sure it was fifty-fifty,\" Colonel Welsh settled the argument with a chuckle. \"Anyway, you're the two lads I need, and here you are. When Sir John and I reached an agreement about you, he simply started the ball rolling, and without your knowing it you were released from the R.A.F., and sent over to me. Right now you haven't any rank, and you don't belong to any branch of service of any country. What do you think of that?\"  Dave gulped and gave a little confused shake of his head.  \"What do I think of it?\" he echoed. \"I--well--well, it sounds as if we were headed for a firing squad, or something.\"  \"Good grief, yes!\" Freddy Farmer said in a hushed tone. \"At least that!\"  \"Well, you can relax; there's no firing squad,\" Colonel Welsh chuckled. Then as his chuckle died, and his face became grim: \"At least not a United Nations firing squad. But let's not think of it as even a remote possibility. I mean, some Axis crowd putting you against a wall. Now, here's the reason I had you sent over to me, and the plan I have in mind.\"  The chief of all U. S. Intelligence paused, and frowned off into space for a moment as though deliberately choosing the words he would speak next. Finally he brought his gaze back to Dave's and Freddy's faces.  \"There are over one hundred and thirty million people in this country,\" he began slowly. \"Over one hundred and thirty million men, women, and children, who have the Constitutional right to be regarded as loyal Americans--until proved otherwise. That for the moment is my biggest, and toughest task: to find out who in our Army and Navy _isn't_ a loyal American. In short, to find out who is working for Berlin, and Rome, and Tokio, instead of for Washington and Uncle Sam.\"  The Colonel paused, clenched one fist, and a hard agate look came into his dreamy eyes.  \"And we're starting off by not kidding ourselves about a single thing,\" he said. \"We know perfectly well that Hitler has some of his spies planted right in our armed forces. Some are buck privates; some are seamen, third class; and others hold commissions. It's not been made known, and I hope it never will be, but only the other day we nailed a Nazi spy who had actually graduated from West Point. So we're not starting off on this gigantic spy hunt by kidding ourselves that the Axis rats are all civilians living near munitions factories, or camps, and that they only go slinking around corners, and down dark alleys. No, none of that! We're going after this job just as though some of them were in the White House, and in the Army and Navy Departments!\"  The Colonel paused again for breath and to make a little explanatory gesture with his hands.  \"Don't misunderstand me,\" he continued presently. \"Our idea isn't to pull any of this Himmler stuff. I mean, fill the service branches with Gestapo spies ready to cut some poor devil's throat because he gripes at the way Hitler runs things. That isn't our idea at all. We're simply going to try and ferret out the rats Hitler put in our Army and our Navy. Now before you throw a fit wondering how just the two of you could possibly handle a job that size, let me say that you're only going to be given part of the job to do, a little at a time. And your first assignment will be with the Pacific Fleet.\"  The chief of U. S. Intelligence emphasized the last with a nod, and then fell silent. Dave looked at the man, chewed his lower lip for a moment, then started to speak, but thought better of it and closed his mouth.  \"Go ahead, say it, Dawson,\" the Colonel encouraged. \"I'm not through yet, just pausing for breath. Go ahead. What's on your mind?\"  \"I guess my mind's sort of spinning, but hard, if you want the truth,\" Dave said. \"Things are coming at me sort of in bunches. Naturally, Farmer and I are eager and willing to take a good crack at any job handed out to us. But--well, maybe Sir John blew us up to you too much. I mean, we've done some Intelligence work on the other side, sure. And we were lucky. But I don't rate us as experts. At least, I certainly don't rate myself as an expert. I should think you'd have dozens of men right in your own command who could do that sort of a job a darn sight better than we could.\"  \"Quite! And definitely so!\" Freddy Farmer echoed, and shifted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50217"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Pacific Fleet (#4)"],["body","in his chair.  \"Maybe,\" Colonel Welsh grunted. \"Maybe not. The point is, I think not. Certainly I've got some good men under my command. Mighty fine agents, as far as that goes. But you two have something that unfortunately they all lack. That's youth. Then there is another item, and it's probably the most important item of all: the matter of whether or not Axis agents _know who they are_. One of the inside stories of Pearl Harbor, that may come out some day, is that Jap agents and Fifth Columnists knew several of our Intelligence agents stationed in the Islands. That's no reflection on our agents. The Japs just knew who they were, that's all--and walked easy.  \"But your youth is important, too. Don't get sore, but looking at you two, no one would suspect you were connected with Intelligence. Frankly, you look like a couple of red-blooded kids who skipped away and joined up before your parents could stop you. Holy smoke! Just sitting here looking at you for the first time, it's mighty hard to realize that you two youngsters pulled off all those wonderful stunts on the other side. No, you can stop right there with that kind of an argument. You're _just_ the two I need for a job with the Pacific Fleet. I'm completely convinced, and satisfied.\"  Dave gave a little laugh and shrug.  \"Then I guess that's that,\" he said. \"We're all for it, if you really want us. What next? What exactly do you want us to do?\"  \"I could say, the impossible, and I don't think I'd be very far wrong,\" Colonel Welsh said gravely. \"However, I'm going to hope for the best--even believe in miracles, if I have to. And if there ever was a miracle pulled off, it was that little stunt of yours in Belgium just after the Dunkirk business.\"[2]  [Footnote 2: _Dave Dawson With the R.A.F._]  The Intelligence chief paused to nod for emphasis. Then he looked across the huge desk at Captain Lamb.  \"Fish out that X-Four-Six-B case photo, will you?\" he said. \"I think as a starter it would be good for Dawson and Farmer to have a good look at it.\"     CHAPTER FOUR  _Death In The Pacific_   The redheaded Captain nodded, and got up and walked over to the row of files. Dave watched him and got a big kick as the officer jabbed one of a row of buttons and then went back a step. There was a series of clicks, then the file drawer slid noiselessly open, and a folder inside popped up to Captain Lamb's outstretched hand. The instant he pulled it out there were more clicks and the door slid silently shut again.  \"Good grief, magic!\" Freddy Farmer gasped. \"Just as though there were a bloke inside waiting to hand it to him.\"  \"Just about that, yes,\" Colonel Welsh chuckled. \"Now if we can only work out some way for the file folders simply to _tell_ us what they contain, then we'll have something. That would save a lot of time.\"  \"But what would you do with all the time you saved?\" Freddy asked innocently.  Colonel Welsh looked at Dave and winked.  \"Figure up something that would save us more time, I guess,\" he said. \"We Americans are all crazy, you know. Ah, thanks, Lamb.\"  The Intelligence chief took the folder the redheaded captain handed him, and thumbed through it for a moment. Then he pulled out a photograph and placed it face up on the desk between Dave and Freddy.  \"Take a good look at it,\" he said in a grim voice. \"That picture was taken ten days ago.\"  Dave and Freddy bent forward eagerly, but what they saw sobered them instantly. It was a picture of the flight hangar aboard an aircraft carrier. It showed several folded-wing Vought-Sikorsky \"Corsair\" fighter planes parked so that they could be trundled onto the elevator and raised to the flight deck in fast time. Right in front, though, was a Corsair that was blackened and charred by fire. And on the floor were the figures of two men in flying gear. They, too, were blackened by flames, and it didn't take a second look to see that they were dead. To the left and right was portable fire equipment that had been used to put out the fire.  \"Poor devils,\" Dave murmured, and looked up at Colonel Welsh.  \"How in the world did they get so close to the flames?\" Freddy Farmer murmured as though talking to himself.  \"They were murdered!\" Colonel Welsh said bluntly. \"We didn't know it when this picture was taken. We found that out later. They had both been shot through the head. And it's quite definite that the murderer tried to burn up the plane so that it would look like an accident. Fortunately the fire squad got to it and put the flames out before everything was destroyed. Thank God, everything wasn't destroyed. If it had been, we should never have learned the real truth.\"  \"You mean that the two pilots had been murdered, sir?\" Dave asked as the senior paused.  Colonel Welsh shook his head.  \"No,\" he said. Then, reaching out, he almost reverently touched the picture of the two dead men with a fingertip. \"One of those officers was Commander Jackson, executive Flight Officer of the Aircraft Carrier Indian. The other was Lieutenant Commander Pollard, senior Section Leader, and one of the best air tactical men in Naval Aviation. They were murdered and then robbed. Had they been burned to a crisp we would not know the killer had stolen the operation plans of the part the Carrier Indian is to play in a Navy attack on the Jap-mandated islands of the Marshall group.\"  Dave whistled softly, then stared hard at the Intelligence chief.  \"But is that such a big loss, sir?\" he asked. \"Those plans, I mean. Can't they be changed, so that even if the Japs have them it won't make any difference?\"  Colonel Welsh sighed heavily and shook his head.  \"I certainly wish they could be changed,\" he said presently. \"I wish it were as easy as that. But, unfortunately, it isn't. The Indian's plans are just part of a huge plan to knock a good big hole in the Jap naval and air forces in that part of the Southwest Pacific. And an attack on that scale can't be thought up overnight, and put into execution the next morning. It's not simply a question of rushing ships and planes to a certain spot and banging away until you're out of shells and bombs. There's much, much more than that. Your forces must be split up. Your operation timetable must be worked out so that the slower ships will arrive at the same time as the fast ones. Worked out so that certain groups will have mine sweeping and destroyer protection. Worked out so that there will be a covering force in case parts of any unit are forced out of action and must retire. No, Dawson, it's not that simple. There are a hundred and one things to be worked out, so that you stand the maximum chance of the entire operation being carried out like clockwork. So it follows that if one unit is off whack, other units are bound to suffer. The effectiveness of the striking force is reduced. For that matter, effectiveness is reduced all down the line. And at the snap of the fingers you can barge bow-on straight into serious trouble. No, to change the Indian's plans would mean that we'd have to change and alter the entire plan as a whole. And there is the chance that in doing that we would discover that it would be best to give up the whole project.\"  \"Phew, I never dreamed a navy show was that complicated!\" Freddy Farmer breathed. \"But I say, sir! If the blasted Japs know the part the Indian's unit is to play, what can you do about it _but_ change everything, or else give it up entirely.\"  \"I didn't say the Japs had the plans for the Indian's unit,\" the Intelligence chief said. \"Maybe I misled you. I said that the plans are lost. They were stolen from Commander Jackson and Lieutenant Commander Pollard. They had the only copies of the plans, as they were to be in complete charge of the Indian's fighters and bombers in this action. Those plans they carried on their person at all times. And when they were last seen they were on their way below to the hangar deck to check a new gun sight that is to be tried in this coming engagement. They were seen to reach the hangar deck by the Watch Officer. The next time they were seen, they were dead and about to be burned beyond recognition by flaming high test gasoline. But for a machinist's mate who happened to pass that part of the hangar deck, they would have been burned beyond recognition. And we would never have known that their copies of the plans were stolen. True, we would have discovered that they were murdered, shot, just as we did discover. And we might have suspected that the killer had stolen the plans. But now we know that somebody aboard the Indian has those plans.\"  \"Huh?\" Dave gulped. \"Somebody aboard her? You mean, right now?\"  \"I mean right now,\" the chief of U. S. Intelligence said grimly. \"The Indian was at anchor in San Diego Harbor. She's still there. However, the instant it was realized what had happened, the Indian became an isolated ship. Not a man, not even her captain, was allowed to go ashore. I radioed those orders myself. And not a boat of any type was permitted to come so much as within hailing distance. An order was issued to shoot anybody who attempted to leave the Indian, and to shoot anybody who attempted to approach the Indian. That order still stands. Mighty hard on the chaps who were due shore leave--she hadn't been in port more than a day. But we're not taking chances.\"  Colonel Welsh paused for breath, and Dave nodded his head slowly.  \"I get it,\" he said. \"So far no darn Jap has got his hands on those plans. No real Jap, I mean.\"  \"What's that?\" Freddy Farmer spoke up. \"What do you mean, no real Jap?\"  \"A Nazi can pass for an Englishman, or a Yank, or 'most any nationality under the sun,\" Dave said. \"But that's barring the yellow races, of course. And that's just what I mean. A Jap aboard an American ship can't pass for a Yank. He's out and out of the yellow race. And you haven't any Americanized Japs on the Indian, have you, sir?\"  Dave directed the last at Colonel Welsh, who instantly shook his head.  \"None,\" the senior officer"]]]
