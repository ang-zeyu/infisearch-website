He couldn't be sure the light was right, enough so that he'd be noticed, not so much that the details of his appearance would be plain. He wished he could ask Jordan, but Jordan was in no position to tell him.  The footsteps came nearer and so did profanity, rich in volume but rather meager in imaginative symbolism. Docchi flashed his face once, as bright as he could manage, and then lowered the intensity immediately.  The footsteps stopped. \"Docchi?\"  \"No. Just a lonely little light bulb out for an evening stroll.\"  The rocket pilot's laughter wasn't altogether friendly. \"Sure it's you. I'd recognize you at the bottom of the sea. What I mean was what are you doing here?\"  \"I saw the lights go out in the rocket dome. The airlock at the entrance was open so I came. I thought I might be able to help.\"  \"The lights are off all right. Everything. Even the standby system. First time in my life even the hand beams wouldn't go on.\" The pilot moved closer. The deadly little toaster was in his hand. \"Thanks, but you can't help. You'd better get out. It's against regulations for patients to be in here. You might steal a rocket or something.\"  Docchi ignored the weapon. \"What was the cause, a high velocity meteor strike?\"  The pilot grunted. \"I'd have heard if it was.\"  \"And you didn't hear a thing?\"  \"Nothing.\" The pilot peered intently at Docchi, a barely visible silhouette. \"Well, I see you're getting smart these days. You should do it all the time. Wear your arms. You look better that way even if you can't use them. You look hundred per cent better, almost....\" His voice faded.  \"Almost human?\" asked Docchi kindly. \"Nothing like, say a pair of legs and a very good if slightly used spinal column with a lightning bug face stuck on top? You didn't have this in mind?\"  \"I didn't say it. I'm used to you. I can't help it if you're overly sensitive. I don't suppose it's your fault.\" His voice got higher. \"Anyway I told you to get going. You don't belong in here.\"  \"But I don't want to go,\" said Docchi. \"I'm not afraid of the dark. Are you? I'm looking for some corner to brighten. Can I let a little light in your life?\"  \"I'm supposed to report psycho talk, Docchi, and damned if I won't. Personally I always suspected you. Get out of here before I take your fake hand and drag you out.\"  \"Now you've hurt my feelings,\" said Docchi reproachfully, stepping nimbly away.  \"Don't say you didn't try to make me mad,\" growled the pilot, lunging after him. What he took hold of wasn't an imitation hand, delicately molded and colored to duplicate skin. The hand he touched was real and the muscles in it were more than a match for his own. It was surprise, at first, that caused him to scream.  Docchi bent double and the dark figure on his back came over his head like a knife from a sheath. The pilot was lifted off his feet and slammed to the floor.  \"Jordan,\" gurgled the pilot.  \"It's me,\" said Jordan. He wrapped one arm around the pilot's throat and clamped tight. With the other he felt for the toaster the pilot still held but hadn't time to use. Effortlessly he tore it away and hammered the man unconscious with the butt. He stopped just short of smashing the skull. Docchi stood ineffectually by, kicking where he could, but the action was fast and he had no arms.  But Jordan didn't need help. \"Let there be light,\" he said when he was finished, and there was--a feeble flickering illumination from Docchi.  Jordan balanced himself with his hands. He had a strong head and massive powerful arms and shoulders. His body stopped below his chest, there was no more. A round metal capsule contained his digestive organs. Accidentals were indeed the odds and ends of creation, and of Jordan one end was missing. But the part that remained made up for the loss.  \"Dead?\" Docchi glanced down at the pilot.  Jordan rocked forward and listened for the heartbeat. \"Nah,\" he said. \"I was going to clout him again but I remembered we can't afford to kill anybody.\"  \"See that you don't forget,\" said Docchi. He stifled an exclamation as something coiled around his leg. Jumping forward he broke loose from the thing that caught him.  \"Repair robot,\" chuckled Jordan, looking around. \"The place is lousy with them.\"  Docchi blinked on and off in confusion and the robot rolled clumsily toward him.  \"Friendly creature,\" commented Jordan. \"I think it wants to tinker with your lighting system.\"  Docchi shook off the squat contrivance which, after it touched his flesh, whirred puzzledly to itself. The job was beyond its capacity but it didn't leave. \"What'll we do with him?\" asked Docchi, staring at the pilot.  \"He needs attention,\" said Jordan. \"_Not_ the kind I gave him.\" He balanced the toaster in his hand and burned a small hole in the little wheeled monster. Extensibles emerged from the side of the machine and carefully explored the damaged area. The extensibles slid back into the machine and presently came out again with a small torch. It began welding the hole.  Meanwhile Jordan pulled the unconscious man toward him. He leaned against the machine for leverage and raised the inert pilot over his head and laid him gently on the top flat surface. The reaction from the robot was immediate. Another extensible reached out to investigate the body. Jordan welded the joints solid. Three times he repeated the process until the pilot was securely fastened to the robot.  \"It doesn't know when it's licked,\" said Jordan. \"It'll stay there repairing itself until it's completely sound. However I can do something about that.\" He adjusted the toaster beam to an imperceptible thickness and deftly sliced through the control case, removing a circular section. He thrust his hand inside and ripped out circuits. \"No further self-repair,\" he said cheerfully. \"Docchi, I'll need your help. I think it's a good idea to route the robot around the main dome a few times before it delivers the pilot to the hospital. No point giving ourselves away before we're ready.\"  Docchi bent over to help him and with some trouble the proper sequence was implanted. The robot stood motionless as the newest commands shuttled erratically through damaged but not inoperative circuits. Finally it screeched softly and began to roll drunkenly away.  \"Get on my back,\" said Docchi doggedly. \"You know we've got to hurry.\"  \"You're tired,\" said Jordan. \"Half gravity or not, you can't carry me farther.\" He worked swiftly and the harness that had supported him on Docchi's back fell to the floor. \"Stay down and listen,\" growled Jordan as Docchi attempted to get up.  Docchi listened. \"Geepees.\"  \"Yeah,\" said Jordan. \"I wonder who they're after. You'll have to move fast to get to the rocket.\"  \"What can I do when I get there? By myself nothing. You'll have to help me.\"  \"Get on your back and neither of us get there?\" said Jordan. \"You can figure out something later. Start moving.\"  \"I'm not leaving you,\" said Docchi.  A huge paw clamped on the back of his head. \"Now you listen,\" said Jordan fiercely. \"Together we were a better man than the pilot--your legs and my arms. Now we got to separate but we can still prove we're better than Cameron and all his geepees.\"  \"We're not trying to _prove_ anything,\" said Docchi. \"It's a question of urgent principle. Right now there are men who can go to the stars and it's up to us to let the rest of mankind know it.\"  A brilliant light sliced through the darkness and swept around the rocket dome, revealing beams and columns of the structure. \"Maybe you're not trying to prove anything personal,\" said Jordan. \"I am. The rest of us are. Otherwise why shouldn't we let them go on spoon feeding us, rocking us to sleep every night?\" Impatiently he hitched himself along the ground until he came to a column.  \"You can't hide behind that,\" said Docchi.  \"Not behind it. On top I can. With no legs that's where I belong.\" He grasped the steel member in his great hands and in the light gravity ascended rapidly.  \"Careful,\" called Docchi.  \"What have I got to be careful about?\" Jordan's voice floated down from the lacy structure. And it was no longer directly overhead. Jordan was moving away along the beams that stretched from column to column. For those who knew of it there was an unsuspected roadway above. Jordan had it to himself and the geepees would never find him.  It was foolish to become elated over such a trivial thing. Jordan wasn't there yet and what he'd do when he arrived was problematical. But it did prove--yes, there was already proof of some sort for him. Docchi set out, walking faster and faster until he was running. He wouldn't have thought it possible but he was able to increase the distance between himself and the pursuing robots.  Even so he didn't have much time to look around when he reached the rocket. The first glimpse of the ship was disheartening. Passenger and freight locks were still closed. Nona either hadn't understood their instructions completely or she hadn't been able to carry them out. Probably the first. She'd disrupted the circuits, light and scanning, with no tools except her hands. Her skill with machines she couldn't have known about previously was sometimes uncanny. But it was too much to expect that she'd have the rocket ready for them to walk into.  It was up to Docchi to get in by himself. If he was ever going to it would have to be by his own efforts. Momentarily he wished for the toaster they'd taken from the pilot, and then dropped the wish before it was fully formed. With the toaster he might have managed to soften the inside catch at the entrance. And the thought itself was an indication of how his mind rebelled at reality--he had no arms and he couldn't have used the toaster. It was right and proper that Jordan had kept the weapon. It was of value to him.  Docchi searched frantically, trying to comprehend the complex installation around him in a glance. There had to be some provision made for opening the ship when no one was inside, a device"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50736"],["title","Address: Centauri (#5)"],["body","would send an impulse to actuate the catches. He'd be lucky if he could operate it, but luck had been with him so far.  But if there was an external control he failed to find it. And the approaching lights warned that his chances were diminishing. That there was any time left was Cameron's mistake--he'd ordered the geepees to look too thoroughly as they came along. They were capable of faster pursuit. This mistake was on Cameron and he might make more.  From the sounds that drifted to him Docchi surmised that Jordan was still at large, perhaps nearby. Did the doctor know this? Probably not--he'd tend to underestimate the accidentals.  Docchi descended into the shallow landing pit. It was remarkably ill suited for concealment. The walls were smooth, glazed with a faintly green substance, and there were no doors or niches anywhere. Yet he had to be somewhere near the ship and this was as close as he could get. It wouldn't do to wander away--Cameron would post a robot guard around the ship and he wouldn't be able to get back through. He had to hide at once.  He leaned against the stern tube cluster, the metal pressing hard into the thin flesh that covered his back. Seconds passed before he realized that the tubes were the answer. He turned around to look at them. A small boy could climb inside and crawl out of sight. So could a grown man who had no shoulders or arms to get wedged in the narrow cylinder.  It was difficult to get into them. He tried a lower tube, bending down and thrusting his head in. He wriggled and shoved with his feet until he was almost entirely in. His feet were still out and so he bent his knees to get better purchase and forced himself further in. He didn't stop until he was certain he couldn't be seen by anyone who didn't specifically peer into the tube.  He waited there, listening. A geepee came down noisily into the landing pit. The absence of any other sound indicated to Docchi that it probably was radio controlled. The robot clambered around, searching. The noise abated soon but it became apparent that the geepee wasn't going to leave. It had been stationed to watch the pit.  Docchi couldn't get out. He was caught in the pit. He fought back the claustrophobia that swirled through his mind. It was nothing to be afraid of; he could assure his rescue, or capture, by shouting. The robot would drag him out instantly.  But that was not the only way. The tube extended forward as well as back. The inner end of the tube was closed with a combustion chamber which was singed and would swing away. The ship hadn't been used for months and there was a distinct possibility that the tubes _were_ open at the other end. He might get through.  He stopped to catch his breath. The metal conducted sound well, almost magnifying it. In the interval, over his own breathing, he heard the characteristic sputter, like frying, that the toaster beam made when it struck metal. A great clatter followed.  \"Get him,\" shouted Cameron. \"He's up there.\"  Jordan had arrived and succeeded in disabling a geepee. And Cameron would find out that he wasn't easily captured. The diversion came when Docchi needed it.  \"Don't use heat,\" ordered Cameron. \"Get lights on him. Drive him up higher. Corner him and go up and get him.\"  Docchi had been wrong; the geepees were voice controlled, not by radio. It would make it easier once he got inside. If he ever did get in the ship. But he had to hurry. Jordan couldn't elude the robots forever.  Docchi shoved on less cautiously. The robot in the pit had joined the others and he needn't fear detection. It became harder to advance, though. He had expected it but he didn't know it would be this hard to push through the narrowing tube.  His legs slipped and it didn't matter, somehow he inched along. Blood pounded furiously but his head slid out of the end of the tube--and he was looking at the inside of the ship.  He gazed longingly at the combustion cap a few feet away. If he had hands he could grasp it and pull himself out. But if he had, he'd never have gotten this far. He closed his eyes to rest for a moment and then continued wriggling, his back arching with the effort. He was nearly through now, only his legs were in the tube. He kicked once, hard, and fell to the floor.  He lay there until his head cleared and his breath came back. He rolled over, bent his knees, and stood up, staggering forward through the corridor to the control compartment. The rocket was his but he didn't want it for himself, and by himself he couldn't use it.  He studied the instrument panel carefully. It had been a long time since he'd operated a ship. A long time and two arms ago. When he thought he understood he bent down and thrust his chin against a dial. Laboriously he rotated his head, turning the dial to the setting he wanted. Then he sat down and kicked on a switch. The ship rocked--and rose a few inches.  He was betting that Cameron wouldn't notice it. The doctor ought to be too busy trying to capture Jordan. But if Cameron did see what was happening, he had thirty seconds in which to stop Docchi. It wasn't enough. Things looked good for their plan.  \"Rocket landing,\" said Docchi when the allotted thirty seconds had passed. \"Emergency instructions. Repeat, emergency instructions. Stand by.\" Technically the ship was in flight, though by very little, and the frequency he was using was assurance that the message would be heard, and heeded.  \"All energized geepees lend assistance. This order supersedes any previous command. Additional equipment is necessary to prepare for a possible crash landing.\" After listing what equipment was needed Docchi sat down and chuckled.  He waited for another few minutes and then flicked on the external lights with his knee. He got up and went to the passenger entrance, brushing against the switch on the way. The passenger ramp swung down and he stood boldly at the entrance, looking out. The whole rocket dome was floodlighted by the ship, beams and columns standing out in sharp detail. It was an impressive structure now, even beautiful, though he remembered hating it once, coming in.  \"All right, Jordan, it's safe to come down,\" he called.  Jordan dangled overhead. He swung along until he reached a column and slid down. Awkwardly he propelled himself across the floor and up the ramp. Balancing himself with his hands he looked up at Docchi.  \"Well, monster,\" he grinned. \"How did you do it?\"  \"Monster yourself,\" said Docchi. \"I crawled through the rocket tube.\"  \"I saw you start in,\" said Jordan. \"I wasn't sure you'd make it. Even when the ship rose I wasn't certain until you came out.\" Jordan scratched his cheek. \"What I meant was: how did you get rid of Cameron?\"  \"Doctors usually aren't mechanically inclined,\" said Docchi. \"Cameron was no exception. He forgot an emergency rocket landing cancels any verbal orders. So I took the ship up a few inches. Geepees aren't very bright and it wouldn't matter if they were. As long as the ship was in the air and I said I was coming in for a landing they had to obey.\"  Jordan nodded delightedly. \"Poor doc,\" he said. \"It wasn't that he was dumb. There was nothing he could do when you outsmarted him.\"  \"He should have anticipated it,\" said Docchi. \"He could have splashed heat against a gravity generator. This would have created an emergency condition in the main dome, artificial of course, but it would have outweighed the one I set up. He'd have had priority, not me, and he could have directed the robots from gravity center.\"  \"_I_ wouldn't have thought of it,\" said Jordan. \"Anyway, how did you get the robots to rush off, carrying Cameron with them?\"  \"I didn't have to do anything. As long as the pilot of the incoming ship declares he may crash, the geepees must remove all humans from the danger zone, willing or not. They'd have taken you too if they could have reached you but they had to abandon that idea when I ordered crash equipment.\"  \"Glad they did,\" said Jordan. \"Wouldn't want to hear what Cameron's saying. Besides it's safer inside the ship.\" He swung himself in, touching the hull fondly, peering down the corridor with grave wonder. \"It's ours now,\" he said. \"But what about the others? How do we get them?\"  \"Anti's taken care of. Geepees aren't built to question anything and in their mind she's listed as emergency landing material. They'll bring her. And Nona is supposed to be waiting with Anti.\" Docchi's face showed misgiving. \"I think we made it clear she was supposed to stay there.\"  \"What if she didn't understand?\"  \"I'm sure she did,\" said Docchi. \"It wasn't complicated. Meanwhile you'd better get ready to lift ship.\"  Jordan disappeared, heading toward the control compartment. Docchi stationed himself at the passenger lock. He had said the instructions weren't hard to understand, and they weren't--for anyone else. But to Nona the world was upside down; the simplest things often she didn't comprehend--and the reverse was true. He hoped she hadn't got mixed up.  He had little time to dwell on it. The geepees were coming back. He heard them first and saw them seconds later. They came into sight half carrying, half pushing a huge rectangular tank. With ingenuity that was unexpected in robots they had mounted it on four of their smaller brethren, the squat repair robots. This served to support the tremendous weight.  The tank was filled with blue liquid. Twisted pipes dangled from the ends--it had been torn from the pit in the ground, lifted up from the foundation. Broken plants still clung to a narrow ledge on top and moist soil adhered to the sides. Wracked out of shape and askew, the tank was intact and did not leak. Five geepees pushed it rapidly toward the ship, mechanically oblivious to the disheveled man who shouted and struck at them, incoherent with frustrated rage.  \"Jordan, open the freight lock.\"  In response the ship rose a few more inches and hung quivering. To the rear a section of the ship hinged outward and"]]]
