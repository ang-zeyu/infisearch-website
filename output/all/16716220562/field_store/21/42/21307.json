Elder Orson Hyde said April 9, 1853: \"Suppose the shepherd should discover a wolf approaching the flock, what would he be likely to do? Why, we would suppose, if the wolf was within proper distance, that he would kill him at once * * * kill him on the spot. * * * It would have a tendency to place a terror on those who leave these parts, that may prove their salvation when they see the heads of thieves taken off, or shot down before the public.\"--Journal of Discourses, vol. 1:72, 73.  President Brigham Young preached, February 8, 1857, as follows \"All mankind love themselves; and let these principles be known by an individual and he would be glad to have his blood shed. That would be loving themselves even to an eternal exaltation. Will you love your brothers and sisters likewise when they have committed a sin that cannot be atoned for without the shedding of blood? That is what Jesus Christ meant. He never told a man or woman to love their enemies in their wickedness. He never intended any such thing.  \"I could refer you to plenty of instances where men have been righteously slain in order to atone for their sins. I have seen scores and hundreds of people for whom there would have been a chance in the last resurrection if their lives had been taken and their blood spilled upon the ground, as a smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now angels to the devil, until our elder brother, Jesus Christ, raises them up, conquers death, hell and the grave.[3] I have known a great many men who have left this church, for whom there is no chance whatever for exaltation; but if their blood had been spilt it would have been better for them. The wickedness and ignorance of the nations forbid this principle being in full force, but the time will come when the law of God will be in full force.  \"This is loving our neighbor as ourselves; if he needs help, help him; and if he wants salvation and it is necessary to spill his blood upon the ground in order that he may be saved, spill it.\"--Journal of Discourses, vol. 4, p. 220, or Deseret News, vol. 6, p. 397.  President J. M. Grant said, September 21, 1856: \"I say there are men and women here that I would advise to go to the president immediately, and ask him to appoint a committee to attend to their case, and then let a place be selected, and let that committee shed their blood.\"--_Deseret News_, vol. 6, p. 235.  President Heber C. Kimball said; July 19, 1854: \"It is believed in the world that our females are all common women. Well, in one sense they are common--that is, they are like all other women, I suppose, but they are not unclean, for we wipe all unclean ones out of our midst; we not only wipe them from our streets, but we wipe them out of existence. And if the world wants to practice uncleanness, and bring their prostitutes here, if they do not repent and forsake their sins, we will wipe the evil out. We will not have them in this valley unless they repent, for so help me God, while I live I will lend my hand to wipe such persons out, and I know this people will.\"--_Deseret News_, August 16, 1854, and _Millennial Star_, vol. 16, pages 738-9.  The above statements speak for themselves, and these were what I read to the reporter. You ask, \"Do you _know_ of anyone whose blood was ever shed by the command of the church or members thereof to save his soul?\" To _know_ by hearing such a command given, or seeing a murder committed, is one thing, to believe the evidence of many who have testified is another. No sir, I was never present when such a command was given, nor when murder was committed; but I have read that which leads me to believe that under Brighamism, Utah was for years a land of assassination and a field of blood. What of the Mountain Meadow massacre--the destruction of the Aiken party; the dying confession of Bishop J. D. Lee; the Hickman butcheries; the Danties? Alfred Henry Lewis, writing in _Collier's Weekly_ for March 26, 1904, states: \"Brigham Young invented his destroying angels, placed himself at their head, and when a man rebelled, _he had him murdered_, if one fled the fold he was pursued and slain.\"  The world has recently read the testimony of persons under oath, in Washington, who testified concerning the endowment oaths, so I will forbear any further remarks on this subject.   POLYGAMY  Speaking of \"plural marriage,\" you say, \"I shall not discuss its _virtues_.\" Surely that is kind. Let civilization give ear, Mr. Smith calls that a virtue which wrecks the happiness of every woman who is enslaved by it, that doctrine which permits Brighamites to live in what they call marriage with three sisters at one time, with mother and daughter at the same time. Your father, Joseph F. Smith, married and is now living with _two sisters as wives_. I refer to Julina Lambson and Edna Lambson, both bearing children to him; yet you call that system a _virtue_.  I have no evidence that those men you refer to, as having practiced polygamy _before Young was guilty, as stated by you_. But the following evidence shows clearly that Brigham Young was under suspicion before Joseph's death, and that he has since admitted that he had a revelation on polygamy before the church knew anything of the doctrine:  In a speech of Brigham Young on June 21, 1874, (see _Deseret News_ of July 1, 1874), we read the following statement relative to the origin of this doctrine of polygamy:      While we were in England (in 1839 and 1840, I think) the Lord     manifested to me by vision and His Spirit, things that I did not     then understand. I never opened my mouth to anyone concerning them,     until I returned to Nauvoo; _Joseph had never mentioned this; there     had never been a thought of it in the church_ that I ever knew     anything about at that time;--but I had this for myself and kept it     for myself.--The Messenger, volume 1, page 29.  Well, no one need blame Joseph any more, Brigham is the self-confessed channel through which polygamy was given to his people.  I here submit the testimony of Brigham Young's legal wife, who left him after he was untrue to her. Testimony of Major Thomas Wanless, given to R. C. Evans, his nephew, in the presence of Mrs. Wanless, Mrs. Evans and her daughter, in St. Louis, Missouri, September 7, 1904:      I met Brigham Young's first and legal wife and her daughter in the     winter of 1860 and 1861, at Central City, Colorado; she told me     that Joseph Smith had nothing to do with polygamy; that he did not     teach, practice, or in any way endorse the doctrine of polygamy,     that he had nothing to do with the so-called revelation on     celestial marriage; that he had but one wife. My husband, Brigham     Young, Orson Pratt (she gave the name of another man whose name I     have forgotten) made up the revelation on celestial marriage.      Before they left Illinois some of them practiced polygamy. Brigham     Young went to Utah to reorganize the church and publicly introduced     polygamy, or to reorganize the Church on a polygamous basis.      She left Brigham Young, finally obtained a divorce from him, and     was then living with her daughter. Brigham sent the daughter money     according to an agreement. She told me they ought to have shot     Brigham Young in place of Joseph Smith.  This statement of Major Wanless that she was Brigham's first wife is a mistake. Brigham married Miriam Works, October 8, 1824; she died September 8, 1832. In February, 1834, he married May Ann Angel; she was his _legal wife_, and perhaps is the one referred to by the Major. It is quite pardonable in Major Wanless in getting Brigham's wives mixed up. We opine poor Brigham was at his wit's end to keep the family record correct himself.  Chambers' encyclopedia, volume 8, students' edition, confirms Mrs. Young's statement, in part. It says, speaking of the practice of polygamy: \"Young, Pratt and Hyde are its true originators. Emma, wife and widow of the prophet, stoutly denied that her husband had any wife but herself. Young's revelation she declared to be a fraud.\"  From a host of other witnesses who testify that Brigham Young was the man that introduced polygamy in the Church, I submit the statement of another broken-hearted woman from the ranks of Brigham's Church. Fanny Stenhouse says: \"Polygamy was unheard of among the (English) Saints in 1849.\" (pages 45, 47, 48) \"Tell It All,\" by Fanny Stenhouse. \"In June 1850, I heard the first whisper of polygamy. In January, 1853, I first saw the revelation on Polygamy; it was published in the _Millennial Star_,\" (page 132).  \"Out of thirty thousand Saints in England in 1853, 1776 had been excommunicated for apostasy through polygamy, the president of the conference was cut off,\" (page 160). When speaking regarding polygamy she says: \"They know that the only source of all their revelations is the man BRIGHAM YOUNG,\" (page 190).  \"Brigham has outraged decency and driven asunder the most sacred ties, by his shameless introduction of polygamy,\" (page 273).  \"There have been many apostates from the teachings of Joseph Smith in early days, but of all apostates, Bro. Brigham is the chief,\" (page 614).  It is reported by Fanny Stenhouse, and many others, that Joseph Smith said, \"If ever the Church had the misfortune to be led by Bro. Brigham, he would lead it to hell,\" (page 268).  Why did Joseph Smith a short time prior to his death make the above and similar statements regarding the man Brigham Young? The reason is plain. He too had doubtless heard some rumors as to his conduct and secret teachings, and the evidence would seem to indicate that just before his death he made a move to bring the guilty to judgment. We will let William Marks, who was president of the Nauvoo Stake at the time of Joseph Smith's death testify:  \"A few days after this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],["title","Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#5)"],["body","currence, I met with Bro. Joseph, he said that he wanted to converse with me on the affairs of the Church, and we retired by ourselves; I will give his words _verbatim_ for they are indelibly stamped upon my mind. He said he had desired for a long time to have a talk with me on the subject of polygamy. He said it would eventually prove the overthrow of the Church, and we should soon be obliged to leave the United States, unless it could be speedily put down. He was satisfied that it was a cursed doctrine, and that there must be every exertion to put it down. He said that he would go before the congregation and proclaim against it, and I must go into the High Council, and he would prefer charges against those in transgression, and I must sever them from the Church unless they made ample satisfaction. There was much more said, but this was the substance. The mob commenced to gather about Carthage in a few days after, therefore there was nothing done concerning it.\" (_Saints' Herald_, vol. 1, pp. 22, 23.)  President Marks, after Joseph Smith's death, made mention of the above conversation; it was soon rumored that he was about to apostatize, and that his statement was a tissue of lies.\" (See _Saints' Herald_, vol. 1, pp. 22, 23.)  Speaking of the revelation on polygamy, Marks said, \"I never heard of it during Joseph's life. It was evidently gotten up by Brigham Young and some of the Twelve, after Joseph's death.\" (Briggs' Autobiography; _Herald_ 1901.)  Now I propose to produce evidence showing that Joseph Smith and the Church during his lifetime condemned polygamy in the strongest terms. First, I submit the testimony of thirty-one witnesses as published by the Church on October the 1st, 1842. We deem this sufficient to show you where Joseph and Hyrum Smith stood on this question of polygamy.  \"We, the undersigned members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and residents of the city of Nauvoo, persons of families, do hereby certify and declare, that we know of no other rule or system of marriage than the one published from the Book of Covenants, and we give this certificate to show that Dr. John C. Bennett's secret wife system is a creature of his own make, as we know of no such society in this place, nor never did.\"  This is signed by a number of the leading men of the Church, some of the Twelve Apostles, some of the First Presidency of the Utah Church, and a number of the leading men of the Church. A similar document is signed by Emma Smith the wife of Joseph Smith, and a number of the leading women of the Church, thirty-one witnesses in all.  Now I submit for your consideration a statement made by Joseph Smith and his Brother Hyrum just a few months prior to their assassination. They learned that a man up here in the state of Michigan was teaching polygamy, and this is what they said about it: \"As we have lately been credibly informed that a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a man by the name of Hyrum Brown, has been teaching polygamy and other false and corrupt doctrines, in the county of Lapeer, state of Michigan, this is to notify him and the Church in general that he has been cut off from the Church for his iniquity.\" Signed, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Presidents of the Church.  This was given in February, 1844. Joseph was killed four months after that. Here he declares that polygamy is a crime, and the man was excommunicated from the Church for preaching it. Now I want to give you the testimony of George Q. Cannon, whom I met in Salt Lake City, as one of the presidency of the Salt Lake Mormon Church: \"A prevalent idea has been that this prejudice against us owes its origin and continuation to our belief in a plurality of wives. * * * Joseph and Hyrum Smith were slain in the Carthage Jail, and hundreds of persons were persecuted to death previous to the Church having any knowledge of this doctrine.\"--_Journal of Discourses_, vol. 14, pages 165, 166.[4]  This being true, Joseph Smith was not guilty of the practice of polygamy; he was killed before the people knew anything about polygamy. This is the statement of George Q. Cannon. Let me strengthen this now by the son-in-law of Brigham Young, H. B. Clawson:  \"Polygamy at that time (that is at the time of Joseph Smith's death) was not known among those of the Mormon faith. * * * The doctrine of polygamy was not promulgated until they got to Salt Lake; not, in fact, until some little time after they had arrived there.\" Salt Lake _Herald_, February 9, 1882.[5]  Joseph Smith was killed in 1844. They arrived in Salt Lake the 24th of July, 1847, and he says not until some little time after that was it introduced. The little time was the 29th of August, 1852, eight years and two months after the assassination of Joseph Smith.  We have Brigham Young himself on this. He being interviewed by Senator Trumbull in 1869, said: \"It (polygamy) was adopted by us as a _necessity_ after we came here.\" Ah, there never was a greater truth told in all the world than that. Polygamy was not an original tenet of the Church, and Brigham Young says it was adopted as a _necessity_ after \"we came here.\" The real facts are, Brigham Young, as I will show from their own evidence, and a few other Elders were living vile lives secretly, and to cover up the consequences of their bad conduct, as he truthfully says in this \"as a necessity\"; yea, as a necessity polygamy was introduced. But who will dare to blame Joseph Smith for their introducing polygamy eight years after his death?  I have been careful to take these clippings right from their own papers, so that they cannot say that we have changed the words or anything of that kind. Here is another statement; this is found from Elder Ephraim Jenson:  \"Polygamy was not practiced by the Mormons prior to and at the time of the execution of Joseph Smith, who was executed at Nauvoo, Illinois. * * * Fourth, that only three per cent of the Mormon men practiced polygamy, a proof itself that it was not essential to the creed.\"--_The Yeoman's Shield._  Here is another one:      \"Go back to the foundation of our Church, April 6, 1830, there was no     polygamy practiced or taught in Mormon literature until five years     after that band of persecuted Saints reached Utah.\" _New York Herald_,     January 8, 1900.[6]  This is by Elder Whitaker, who knew who _did_ introduce this polygamy. Now I might introduce dozens and dozens of witnesses to prove that Joseph Smith had nothing to do with it. Well, who did it? Here is what the Apostle's wife says of it: \"How then, asked the reader, did polygamy originate? It was born in the vile and lustful brain of Brigham Young, and was grafted on the faith to gratify his sensual bestiality.\"[7] (Mysteries of Mormonism, pp. 16, 17.)  One of the Mormon wives said that, and she ought to know whereof she affirms.  We have learned from the above statements that polygamy was not taught or practiced by Joseph Smith, but was introduced into an apostate branch of the church, after his death, as is admitted by Brigham Young and others of his followers.  Having read the works of the church for over a quarter of a century. I confidently affirm that there is not a single word, in a single sermon, lecture, statement, newspaper or church publication printed during the lifetime of the Prophet Joseph Smith wherever he, by word, has endorsed the doctrine of plurality of wives; not a single statement; and there is no Salt Lake Mormon breathing who can produce one and prove its authenticity.  But suppose you could prove that Joseph Smith secretly taught and practiced polygamy, that would not make it a Christian doctrine. If Joseph Smith secretly taught, practiced, or endorsed the doctrine of polygamy, he did it contrary to all the revelations given for the government of the church in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants; contrary to all his sermons, speeches, and public teachings; and he was a criminal before the law of his country, a base hypocrite before the God whom he openly worshiped, a despicable traitor to the woman whom he claimed to love and cherish as his wife, and was untrue to all the sacred principles of fidelity and integrity which he evinced in all his public utterances and conduct.  In the face of all this, the wife and children of Joseph Smith, together with thousands of people who knew him in life, refuse to believe the contradictory statements of Brigham Young and others who are wallowing in the mire of polygamy.   MY VISIT TO UTAH  If your father denies that he and I discussed the doctrine of polygamy, all I have to say about it is, that what he states is untrue. Here are a few points that may help him to remember what was said and done: When talking with Joseph F. Smith in Salt Lake City two years ago, he brought up a number of witnesses and I examined them--that is, he repeated the testimony of some who had testified. He finally said, \"I can produce a living woman who will testify that Joseph Smith was a polygamist, and she knew it.\" I said, \"Bring her along here and let us examine her.\" Well, I met \"Aunt Lucy\" Walker Kimball, to whom you refer, and we talked the matter over, and here is the one point to which I want to draw your attention, to show how these poor dupes of Brigham Young may be led. Coming to the testimony of Emma Smith, I said, \"You were personally acquainted with Emma Smith?\" \"Yes.\" \"What have you to say as to her integrity, as to her fidelity and honor?\" The old woman looked me fair in the face and said, \"Emma Smith was one of God's noble women--she was truth personified; and anything that Emma Smith may say you can bank on it until the day of your death.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"she testifies that her husband never had any wife but her; she testifies that she never heard of that revelation on polygamy until you folks had gone to Salt Lake; she testifies she never saw it, and she testifies that it is an unmitigated falsehood manufactured by Brigham "]]]
