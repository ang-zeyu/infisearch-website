At that moment he heard the approaching _chuff_ of the Essex, the door of the cottage opened, and Mary Alice Pope stepped out, closely followed by Hani or Hilda.  Jack shrank close to the shrubbery. Mary looked pale and blank-faced, as if she had retreated within herself. He was acutely conscious of the inadequacy of his screen as the ghostly headlights of the Essex began to probe through the leaves.  But then he sensed that something more was about to happen than just the car arriving. It was a change in the expression of the face behind Mary that gave him the cue--a widening and side-wise flickering of the cold eyes, the puckered lips thinning into a cruel smile.  The Essex shifted into second and, without any warning, accelerated. Simultaneously, the woman behind Mary gave her a violent shove. But at almost exactly the same instant, Jack ran. He caught Mary as she sprawled toward the gravel, and lunged ahead without checking. The Essex bore down upon them, a square-snouted, roaring monster. It swerved viciously, missed them by inches, threw up gravel in a skid, and rocked to a stop, stalled.         *       *       *       *       *  The first, incredulous voice that broke the pulsing silence, Jack recognized as Martin Kesserich's. It came from the car, which was slewed around so that it almost faced Jack and Mary.  \"Hani, you tried to kill her! You and Hilda tried to kill her again!\"  The woman slumped over the wheel slowly lifted her head. In the indistinct light, she looked the twin of the woman behind Jack and Mary.  \"Did you really think we wouldn't?\" she asked in a voice that spat with passion. \"Did you actually believe that Hilda and I would serve this eighteen years' penance just to watch you go off with her?\" She began to laugh wildly. \"You've never understood your sisters at all!\"  Suddenly she broke off, stiffly stepped down from the car. Lifting her skirts a little, she strode past Jack and Mary.  Martin Kesserich followed her. In passing, he said, \"Thanks, Barr.\" It occurred to Jack that Kesserich made no more question of his appearance on the island than of his presence in the laboratory. Like Mrs. Kesserich, the great biologist took him for granted.  Kesserich stopped a few feet short of Hani and Hilda. Without shrinking from him, the sisters drew closer together. They looked like two gaunt hawks.  \"But you waited eighteen years,\" he said. \"You could have killed her at any time, yet you chose to throw away so much of your lives just to have this moment.\"  \"How do you know we didn't like waiting eighteen years?\" Hani answered him. \"Why shouldn't we want to make as strong an impression on you as anyone? And as for throwing our lives away, that was your doing. Oh, Martin, you'll never know anything about how your sisters feel!\"  He raised his hands baffledly. \"Even assuming that you hate me--\" at the word \"hate\" both Hani and Hilda laughed softly--\"and that you were prepared to strike at both my love and my work, still, that you should have waited....\"  Hani and Hilda said nothing.  Kesserich shrugged. \"Very well,\" he said in a voice that had lost all its tension. \"You've wasted a third of a lifetime looking forward to an irrational revenge. And you've failed. That should be sufficient punishment.\"  Very slowly, he turned around and for the first time looked at Mary. His face was clearly revealed by the twin beams from the stalled car.  Jack grew cold. He fought against accepting the feelings of wonder, of poignant triumph, of love, of renewed youth he saw entering the face in the headlights. But most of all he fought against the sense that Martin Kesserich was successfully drawing them all back into the past, to 1933 and another accident. There was a distant hoot and Jack shook. For a moment he had thought it a railway whistle and not a ship's horn.  The biologist said tenderly, \"Come, Mary.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jack's trembling arm tightened a trifle on Mary's waist. He could feel _her_ trembling.  \"Come, Mary,\" Kesserich repeated.  Still she didn't reply.  Jack wet his lips. \"Mary isn't going with you, Professor,\" he said.  \"Quiet, Barr,\" Kesserich ordered absently. \"Mary, it is necessary that you and I leave the island at once. Please come.\"  \"But Mary isn't coming,\" Jack repeated.  Kesserich looked at him for the first time. \"I'm grateful to you for the unusual sense of loyalty--or whatever motive it may have been--that led you to follow me out here tonight. And of course I'm profoundly grateful to you for saving Mary's life. But I must ask you not to interfere further in a matter which you can't possibly understand.\"  He turned to Mary. \"I know how shocked and frightened you must feel. Living two lives and then having to face two deaths--it must be more terrible than anyone can realize. I expected this meeting to take place under very different circumstances. I wanted to explain everything to you very naturally and gently, like the messages I've sent you every day of your second life. Unfortunately, that can't be.  \"You and I must leave the island right now.\"  Mary stared at him, then turned wonderingly toward Jack, who felt his heart begin to pound warmly.  \"You still don't understand what I'm trying to tell you, Professor,\" he said, boldly now. \"Mary is not going with you. You've deceived her all her life. You've taken a fantastic amount of pains to bring her up under the delusion that she is Mary Alice Pope, who died in--\"  \"She _is_ Mary Alice Pope,\" Kesserich thundered at him. He advanced toward them swiftly. \"Mary darling, you're confused, but you must realize who you are and who I am and the relationship between us.\"  \"Keep away,\" Jack warned, swinging Mary half behind him. \"Mary doesn't love you. She can't marry you, at any rate. How could she, when you're her father?\"  \"Barr!\"  \"Keep off!\" Jack shot out the flat of his hand and Kesserich went staggering backward. \"I've talked with your wife--your wife on the mainland. She told me the whole thing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kesserich seemed about to rush forward again, then controlled himself. \"You've got everything wrong. You hardly deserve to be told, but under the circumstances I have no choice. Mary is not my daughter. To be precise, she has no father at all. Do you remember the work that Jacques Loeb did with sea urchins?\"  Jack frowned angrily. \"You mean what we were talking about last night?\"  \"Exactly. Loeb was able to cause the egg of a sea urchin to develop normally without union with a male germ cell. I have done the same tiding with a human being. This girl is Mary Alice Pope. She has exactly the same heredity. She has had exactly the same life, so far as it could be reconstructed. She's heard and read the same things at exactly the same times. There have been the old newspapers, the books, even the old recorded radio programs. Hani and Hilda have had their daily instructions, to the letter. She's retraced the same time-trail.\"  \"Rot!\" Jack interrupted. \"I don't for a moment believe what you say about her birth. She's Mary's daughter--or the daughter of your wife on the mainland. And as for retracing the same time-trail, that's senile self-delusion. Mary Alice Pope had a normal life. This girl has been brought up in cruel imprisonment by two insane, vindictive old women. In your own frustrated desire, you've pretended to yourself that you've recreated the girl you lost. You haven't. You couldn't. Nobody could--the great Martin Kesserich or anyone else!\"  Kesserich, his features working, shifted his point of attack. \"Who are you, Mary?\"  \"Don't answer him,\" Jack said. \"He's trying to confuse you.\"  \"Who are you?\" Kesserich insisted.  \"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said rapidly in a breathy whisper before Jack could speak again.  \"And when were you born?\" Kesserich pressed on.  \"You've been tricked all your life about that,\" Jack warned.  But already the girl was saying, \"In 1916.\"  \"And who am I then?\" Kesserich demanded eagerly. \"Who am I?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The girl swayed. She brushed her head with her hand.  \"It's so strange,\" she said, with a dreamy, almost laughing throb in her voice that turned Jack's heart cold. \"I'm sure I've never seen you before in my life, and yet it's as if I'd known you forever. As if you were closer to me than--\"  \"Stop it!\" Jack shouted at Kesserich. \"Mary loves me. She loves me because I've shown her the lie her life has been, and because she's coming away with me now. Aren't you, Mary?\"  He swung her around so that her blank face was inches from his own. \"It's me you love, isn't it, Mary?\"  She blinked doubtfully.  At that moment Kesserich charged at them, went sprawling as Jack's fist shot out. Jack swept up Mary and ran with her across the lawn. Behind him he heard an agonized cry--Kesserich's--and cruel, mounting laughter from Hani and Hilda.  Once through the ragged doorway in the fence, he made his way more slowly, gasping. Out of the shelter of the trees, the wind tore at them and the ocean roared. Moonlight glistened, now on the spine of black wet rocks, now on the foaming surf.  Jack realized that the girl in his arms was speaking rapidly, disjointedly, but he couldn't quite make out the sense of the words and then they were lost in the crash of the surf. She struggled, but he told himself that it was only because she was afraid of the menacing waters.  He pushed recklessly into the breaking surf, raced gasping across the middle of the spine as the rocks uncovered, sprang to the higher ones as the next wave crashed behind, showering them with spray. His chest burning with exertion, he carried the girl the few remaining yards to where the _Annie O._ was tossing. A sudden great gust of wind almost did what the waves had failed to do, but he kept his footing and lowered the girl into the boat, then jumped in after.  She stared at him wildly. \"What's that?\"  He, too, had caught the faint shout."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50905"],["title","Yesterday House (#5)"],["body","back along the spine just as the Moon came clear again, he saw white spray rise and fall--and then the figure of Kesserich stumbling through it.  \"Mary, wait for me!\"  The figure was halfway across when it lurched, started forward again, then was jerked back as if something had caught its ankle. Out of the darkness, the next wave sent a line of white at it neck-high, crashed.  Jack hesitated, but another great gust of wind tore at the half-raised sail, and it was all he could do to keep the sloop from capsizing and head her into the wind again.  Mary was tugging at his shoulder. \"You must help him,\" she was saying. \"He's caught in the rocks.\"  He heard a voice crying, screaming crazily above the surf:      \"Ah, love, let us be true     To one another! for the world--\"  The sloop rocked. Jack had it finally headed into the wind. He looked around for Mary.  She had jumped out and was hurrying back, scrambling across the rocks toward the dark, struggling figure that even as he watched was once more engulfed in the surf.  Letting go the lines, Jack sprang toward the stern of the sloop.  But just then another giant blow came, struck the sail like a great fist of air, and sent the boom slashing at the back of his head.  His last recollection was being toppled out onto the rocks and wondering how he could cling to them while unconscious.   VII  The little cove was once again as quiet as time's heart. Once again the _Annie O._ was a sloop embedded in a mirror. Once again the rocks were warm underfoot.  Jack Barr lifted his fiercely aching head and looked at the distant line of the mainland, as tiny and yet as clear as something viewed through the wrong end of a telescope. He was very tired. Searching the island, in his present shaky condition, had taken all the strength out of him.  He looked at the peacefully rippling sea outside the cove and thought of what a churning pot it had been during the storm. He thought wonderingly of his rescue--a man wedged unconscious between two rock teeth; kept somehow from being washed away by the merest chance.  He thought of Mrs. Kesserich sitting alone in her house, scanning the newspapers that had nothing to tell.  He thought of the empty island behind him and the vanished motorboat.  He wondered if the sea had pulled down Martin Kesserich and Mary Alice Pope. He wondered if only Hani and Hilda had sailed away.  He winced, remembering what he had done to Martin and Mary by his blundering infatuation. In his way, he told himself, he had been as bad as the two old women.  He thought of death, and of time, and of love that defies them.  He stepped limpingly into the _Annie O._ to set sail--and realized that philosophy is only for the unhappy.  Mary was asleep in the stern."]]]
