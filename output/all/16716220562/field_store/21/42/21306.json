II Nephi 9:7.--And if so, (not an infinite atonement) this flesh     must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to     rise no more.  From the Bible:      Mark 14:22-25.--And as they did eat, Jesus took bread and blessed     and brake it, and gave to them, and said: Take, eat; this is my     body.      And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to     them: and they all drank of it.      And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament which     is shed for many.      Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the     vine, until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.  From the Doctrine and Covenants:      Section 45:4.--(Utah edition) Saying, Father, behold the sufferings     and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased;     behold the blood of thy Son which was shed--the blood of him whom     thou gavest that thyself might be glorified.      Section 74:7.--But little children are holy, being sanctified     through the atonement of Jesus Christ, and this is what the     scriptures mean.      Section 76:39-41.--For all the rest shall be brought forth by the     resurrection of the dead, through the triumph and the glory of the     Lamb, who was slain, who was in the bosom of the Father before the     worlds were made. And this is the gospel, the glad tidings which     the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us. That he came into     the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear     the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it     from all unrighteousness.      Section 29:1.--Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer,     the Great I AM, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins. Verse     17.--And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the     world, that I will take vengeance upon the wicked, for they will     not repent; for the cup of mine indignation is full; for behold, my     blood shall not cleanse them if they hear me not.   STATEMENT OF AN ENEMY  But the report says: \"This doctrine was introduced by Brigham Young\" and that it meant \"death to anyone who left the Church * * * that the apostate whose throat was cut from ear to ear * * * saved his soul.\" Why you made this statement you best know; but were you not aware that it was but the repetition of the ravings of enemies of the Church, without one grain of truth? Did you not know that not a single individual was ever \"blood atoned,\" as you are pleased to call it, for apostasy or any other cause? Were you not aware, in repeating this false charge, that it was made by the most bitter enemies of the Church before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith? Do you know of anyone whose blood was ever shed by the command of the Church, or members thereof, to \"save his soul?\" Did you not know that you were embittering the people against the \"Mormon\" Elders, and that just such malicious charges and false insinuations have made martyrs for the Church, whose blood does not \"cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth?\"  Never in the history of this people can the time be pointed to when the Church ever attempted to pass judgment on, or execute an apostate as per your statement. There are men living in Utah today who left the Church in the earliest history of our State who feel as secure, and are just as secure and free from molestation from their former associates as you or any other man could be.   EFFICACY OF THE BLOOD OF CHRIST  The Latter-day Saints believe in the efficacy of the blood of Christ. They believe that through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel they obtain a remission of sins; but this could not be if Christ had not died for _them_. If you did believe in blood atonement, I might ask you why the blood of Christ was shed? and _in whose stead was it shed_? I might ask you to explain the words of Paul: \"Without shedding of blood is no remission.\"   UNPARDONABLE SINS  Are you aware that there are certain sins that man may commit for which the atoning blood of Christ does not avail? Do you not know, too, that this doctrine is taught in the Book of Mormon? And is not this further reason why you should discard the Book as well as the name? Is it not safe for us to rely upon the scriptures for the solution of problems of this kind? Let me quote:  From the Book of Mormon:      II Nephi 9:35.--Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth, for     he shall die.      Alma 1:13, 14.--And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man,     yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to     spare thee, his blood would come upon us for vengeance.      Alma 42:19.--Now, if there were no law given--if a man murdered he     should die, would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?  From the Bible:      Genesis 9:12, 13.--And whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his     blood be shed; for man shall not shed the blood of man.      For a commandment I give, that every man's brother shall preserve     the life of man, for in mine own image have I made man. (Inspired     translation.)      Luke 11:50.--That the blood of all the prophets, which was     shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this     generation.      Hebrews 9:22.--And almost all things are by the law purged with     blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.      Hebrews 10:26-29.--For if we sin wilfully, after that we have     received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more     sacrifice for sins.      * * * *      He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three     witnesses;      Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought     worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath     counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an     unholy thing.      (I commend to you the careful reading of these two chapters:)      I John 3:15.--No murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.      I John 5:16.--If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not     unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that     sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he     shall pray for it.  From the Doctrine and Covenants:      Section 87:7.--That the cry of the saints, and of the blood of     the saints, shall cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of     Sabbath, from the earth, to be avenged of their enemies.      Section 101:80.--And for this purpose have I established the     constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men, whom I raised     up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of     blood.      Section 42:18, 19.--And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou     shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in     this world, nor in the world to come.      And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall     die.      Verse 79.--And it shall come to pass, that if any persons among you     shall kill, they shall be delivered up and dealt with according to     the laws of the land; for remember that he hath no forgiveness, and     it shall be proved according to the laws of the land.   THE LAW OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  In pursuance of, and in harmony with this scriptural doctrine, which has been the righteous law from the days of Adam to the present time, the founders of Utah incorporated in the laws of the Territory provisions for the capital punishment of those who wilfully shed the blood of their fellow man. This law, which is now the law of the State, granted unto the condemned murderer the privilege of choosing for himself whether he die by hanging, or whether he be shot, and thus have his blood shed in harmony with the law of God; and thus atone, so far as it is in his power to atone, for the death of his victim. Almost without exception the condemned party chooses the latter death. This is by the authority of the law of the land, not that of the Church. This law was placed on the statutes through the efforts of the \"Mormon\" legislators, and grants to the accused the right of jury trial. It is from this that the vile charge, which you are pleased to repeat, has been maliciously misconstrued by the enemies of the Church, who prefer to believe a lie. When men accuse the Church of practicing \"blood atonement\" on those who deny the faith, or, for that matter, on any living creature, they know that they bear false witness, and they shall stand condemned before the judgment seat of God.   PLURAL MARRIAGE  Since the action taken by the United States government, and also by the Church, in regard to plural marriage, I shall not discuss its virtues nor answer arguments in opposition to that principle as a principle of our faith. As you, however, are reported to have said that \"Brigham Young introduced\" that doctrine \"in Salt Lake City,\" I would be pleased if you would explain, as a matter of history, why Sidney Rigdon, before \"President Young introduced\" the doctrine, declared that the principle of plural marriage was introduced, to his knowledge, by Joseph Smith the Prophet, and that he, Sidney Rigdon, rejected that doctrine and \"warned Joseph Smith and his family\" that it would bring ruin upon them. You will find this in the _Messenger and Advocate_, published in June, 1846, volume 2, page 475, number 6. Will you kindly explain why this same Sidney Rigdon practiced polygamy, which he so fervently condemns? Will you kindly explain why Lyman Wight, James J. Strang, Gladden Bishop, William Smith, and others, none of whom had much love for President Young and did not follow him, also taught and practiced polygamy _before plural marriage was \"introduced by President Young_.\" If you doubt this, I will gladly furnish you with the proof. Indeed, you may find a great deal of it in the third volume of your church history.   THE \"SAINTS'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],["title","Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#3)"],["body"," HERALD\" AS A WITNESS  If you believe your statement to be true, will you kindly explain the following paragraph in the _Saints Herald_, your official organ, volume 1, page 9. It would be well for you to read the entire chapter, which is entitled \"polygamy.\" The quotation is:  \"_The death of the prophet is one fact that has been realized, although he abhorred and repented of this iniquity (meaning 'polygamy,') before his death. This branch of the subject we shall leave to some of our brethren, who are qualified to explain it satisfactorily_.\"  In the same volume, page 27, what is meant by the following?  \"_He (Joseph Smith) caused the revelation on the subject ('polygamy') to be burned, and when he voluntarily came to Nauvoo and resigned himself into the arms of his enemies he said that he was going to Carthage to die. At that time he also said that if it had not been for that accursed spiritual wife doctrine, he would not have come to that.\" Kindly read the context_.  _There is more evidence that can be produced, but if you will explain this it may suffice_.  In the light of the knowledge I have received and the evidence at my command, I know that the Prophet Joseph Smith made no such statement as the above, and that he did not have the revelation burned. _There is, however, value in the above statements from your \"Herald,\" for they bear witness to the origin and introduction of the principle of plural marriage, and the revelation concerning the same_.[2]   THE UTAH VISIT  In connection with this, let me call your attention to your visit to Salt Lake City some three years ago. At that time you met President Lorenzo Snow, a man whose veracity cannot justly be questioned; you heard him bear his testimony to the effect that he was taught that principle by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that the Prophet declared to Lorenzo Snow that he had married his sister, Eliza R. Snow. You met and conversed with Lucy Walker Smith, and she told you that she was married to the Prophet Joseph Smith on the first day of May, 1843, in Nauvoo, Elder William Clayton performing the ceremony. You met Catherine Phillips Smith, who told you she was married in August, 1843, in Nauvoo, to the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, his brother Joseph the Prophet officiating in that ceremony. You will remember that the first wives of both these men were living at the time. I hardly think these testimonies have passed from your memory in so brief a time. I am personally acquainted with these women, and know that they are truthful and honest--honorable women, whose testimonies should be believed.  In the face of all this evidence, do you think it fair and consistent for you and your fellow believers to constantly lay at the door of President Young the responsibility for the \"introduction of plural marriage\" and the \"authorship\" of the above mentioned revelation?  My letter is already long, but I desire to briefly mention another item or two.   PRESIDENT SMITH'S DENIAL  In the interview you are made to say that while on your visit to Salt Lake City, you spent a day and a half with Joseph F. Smith; that you and he \"differed on polygamy,\" and that you \"told him it was vile and wicked, always had been, and always would be.\" I took occasion to ask my father if you and he had discussed polygamy at that time and if you had uttered that above expression or any other of like nature. He replied that he had no discussion with you on that subject; that you did not say one word to him in relation to polygamy, either favorable or otherwise; that your visit was a social one, and friendly, and was not occupied by the discussion of any differences which may have existed.  _It is true that President Young was elected president at Kanesville, but on what grounds do you charge him with holding the office in trust for the \"dead president's son?\" Do you not know that such a statement--contrary to the written word--was antagonistic to the teachings of President Young, as recorded in the \"Times and Seasons,\" as well as since that Time_?   PRESIDENT YOUNG THE PROPHET'S FRIEND  _Will you please explain on what grounds you charge President Young as being \"under suspicion at the time of Joseph Smith's death?\" Am I to infer by this that you mean to convey the idea that Brigham Young was in any way responsible for the death of Joseph Smith? The Prophet never had a truer friend. You know that at the time of the martyrdom Brigham Young was on a mission away from home. If this is the inference you wish to convey, it is not only contemptible but viciously false_.[3]  With reference to my father's first wife, you say she died \"broken hearted and insane.\" If you mean to insinuate that this condition, if true, was the result of any act whatever on the part of my father, it is also scandalously false. I have good reason to believe that she died neither broken hearted nor insane. If it were true, I would still think that you, as a professed minister of the Gospel, might employ your time to better advantage than as an aspersor or a scandal-monger.                                            Respectfully,                                              Joseph F. Smith, Jr.   Footnotes  1. This sentence in italics was omitted in Mr. Evans' publication of the _entire matter_ in the _Zion's Ensign_, August 17th, 1905.  2. The quotations from the _Saints' Herald_ which are in Italics were purposely omitted from Mr. Evans' \"publication of the entire matter,\" as it appeared in the _Zion's Ensign_ of August 7, 1905. The reason for the suppression of this evidence is easy to discern. The authorities of the \"Reorganization\" have tried to destroy the evidence, that it could not be circulated among their church members, therefore very few copies of this particular _Herald_ can today be found.  3. These paragraphs in italics were also omitted from Mr. Evans' \"publication of the entire matter,\" as it appeared in the _Zion's Ensign_ August 17, 1905.    MR. EVANS' LETTER  _Mr. Joseph F. Smith, Jr.:_  Sir:--Your open letter published in the Toronto _Star_ for February 25, is before me. You say: \"I desire to be fair, dispassionate and also candid.\" Those who read your letter will see plainly that you have mispresented the interview, my faith and the facts concerning my visit to Salt Lake, and that you are guilty of a labored effort to cover up the _true facts_ regarding \"blood atonement,\" \"polygamy,\" etc., and my faith in the Book of Mormon. So much for those desires.  My position with regard to the Book of Mormon, and the name \"Mormon,\" is too well known for you to blind the people concerning it. The interview shows plainly in what sense \"the term 'Mormon' is offensive to us.\" Read it again, sir: \"Because it is associated in the public mind with the practices that I have specified.\" The abominations of _Brighamism_; namely, polygamy, blood atonement, Adam-God,[1] and other evils that have disgraced the name throughout civilization.  The true Church never has adopted the name \"Mormon\" as being the proper name of the church. The Latter-day Saints were sometimes called \"Mormons\" in derision, as you admit, because they believed in the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon, and some church members may have been willing to be called \"Mormon\"; yet you \"candidly (?) fairly, dispassionately\" ask me, \"Why do you not discard the Book of Mormon from whence the name is derived?\" Now, sir, I profess to believe in the divine authenticity of the Holy Bible; as well call me a Bible, because I believe in the Bible,[2] as call me a Mormon because I believe in the Book of Mormon.  The church that I have the honor to represent is incorporated under the laws of the United States as \"The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\"   BLOOD ATONEMENT  There is not an honest thinking person on earth who is acquainted with the faith of the church regarding the atonement of Jesus Christ but that will say your attempt to misrepresent my faith in this regard is diametrically opposite to your stated desire to be \"fair, dispassionate and candid.\" You know that a prominent article in the Epitome of the Faith and Doctrine of the _true church_ reads as follows: \"We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all men may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.\" You know that the true church believes in the atoning blood of Christ as stated in the scriptures you cite in your letter, and yet you try to make out that because we do not believe in the doctrine of blood atonement as taught by Brigham Young and his successors in \"Utah Mormonism,\" that we do not believe in the atonement of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  The doctrine of the atonement of Christ is far above the doctrine of blood atonement as taught by Brighamism. To prove this, I submit the statements as made by Brigham Young and other leading members of the Utah Church, as found in their sermons, printed by your church:  Brigham Young said, October 9, 1852: \"What shall be done with the sheep that stink the flock so? We will take them, I was going to say, and cut off their tails two inches behind their ears; however I will use a milder term, and say cut off their ears.\"--Journal of Discourses, vol. 1:213.  Brigham said again, March 27, 1853: \"I say, rather than that apostates should flourish here, I will unsheath my bowie knife, and conquer or die. (Great commotion in the congregation and a simultaneous burst of feeling, assenting to the declaration.) Now, you nasty apostates, clear out, or judgment will be put to the line and righteousness to the plummet. (Voices generally, 'Go it, go it.') If you say it is all right, raise your hands (all hands up). Let us call upon the Lord to assist us in this and every good work.\"--Journal of Discourses, vol. 1:83.  Echoing what Brigham said, P. P. Pratt said, on March 27, 1853, \"My feelings are with those who have spoken, decidedly and firmly so. * * * I need not repeat their doom, it has been told here today,"]]]
