He stared at them for a moment without speaking, then put out his hand to Dawson.  \"Mind letting me see those papers you say you took from them?\" he said.  \"Sure, of course, sir,\" Dave replied, and fished them from his torn tunic pocket and handed them over.  Colonel Fraser spent a good five minutes going through them while the other four in the room waited with mounting impatience plainly stamped on their faces. Finally, Colonel Fraser stacked them all together and stuck the lot in his pocket.  \"The rotters!\" he said in a withering voice. \"The dirty rotters. But that Herr Baron is a clever devil, blast his black heart. I'd give my crown and pips to lay that one low. And you had him right here all tied up? What rotten luck!\"  \"I could cut my throat for not making sure he was trussed up for keeps!\" Dawson said bitterly. \"But as a matter of fact I was so sure that he was there to stay put.\"  \"Well, I feel even worse because I tied up the beggar,\" Freddy Farmer said. Then, with a little gesture of one hand, he added, \"But I wonder?\"  \"Wonder what?\" Colonel Fraser asked when the English youth didn't continue.  \"I wonder if he did get loose by himself?\" Freddy said with a frown. \"After all, we know that there were two more of them on the roof. Perhaps there were others. Others who sneaked in here and freed the two live ones, and helped cart the dead one away.\"  \"No soap on that, I'd say,\" Dawson said slowly. \"I mean, I don't think they'd have lighted out without finishing us off first.\"  \"No, I think you're wrong there, Dawson, old chap,\" Captain Small said with an apologetic side glance at his superior. \"I don't think they bothered about you two because they knew the jig was up. I mean, you see, they knew that Farmer had phoned us, and that we were on the way. I fancy that their first thought was to get away from here as soon as possible.\"  \"But why take the dead man?\" Dave argued.  Captain Small shrugged and smiled.  \"You have me there, old chap,\" he said. \"But no doubt, it was so that we wouldn't be able to obtain positive identification of the beggar.\"  \"But how they did it, and where they went, is really the important part,\" Freddy Farmer said with a frown. Then, looking at Colonel Fraser, he said, \"If I may make a suggestion, sir, why not have this whole building searched? There's no telling what you might gather up.\"  \"Ahead of you there, Farmer,\" the senior officer said. \"I have men doing that very thing right now. They are going from floor to floor, and checking up on everybody. They'll be up here to report before long, I expect.\"  \"Do you mind a direct question, sir?\" Dawson suddenly asked him.  \"Why, no, not at all. Fire away, Dawson.\"  \"About this Karl Stoltz, and Paul von Heimmer, sir,\" Dave said. \"Do you know if your department has ever heard of either of them?\"  The colonel smiled broadly, and nodded.  \"I've been waiting for that question,\" he said. \"Yes. We know all about Herr Karl Stoltz and Herr Paul von Heimmer. They arrived in England about six months ago. By parachute from a German night reconnaissance plane. But they didn't get very far because we had been informed by one of our own agents in Germany of their coming. They were given a military trial, and shot. Unfortunately, though, we were unable to learn anything of the work they planned to do in England. However, it undoubtedly was to have something to do with the American Air Forces, because they were both dressed as captain pilots when we gathered them in.\"  Colonel Fraser paused, and a slow smile curled his lips.  \"And you need not ask the next question,\" he said. \"I'll answer it for you now. Stoltz and von Heimmer bore a very startling resemblance to you two. I can quite readily see how Herr Baron and his two henchmen mistook you for them.\"  There was a moment of stunned silence; then Dave burst out laughing and looked at Freddy Farmer.  \"Well, what do you know!\" he chuckled. \"Here I've been palling around all these years with a guy who has a mug like a Nazi's. No wonder my best friends wouldn't tell me! And me worrying because I was afraid it was B.O.!\"  \"Very, very funny!\" Freddy snapped, and then looked at Colonel Fraser. \"Von Heimmer was rather a good-looking chap, wasn't he, sir? And Stoltz had a face like a jammed bomb bay door?\"  The senior officer looked puzzled for a moment, and then raised both hands in protest, and shook his head.  \"Now, none of that, Farmer!\" he said with a laugh. \"I can see that you two haven't changed much in that respect. Oh, no! I'm jolly well not going to let you drag me into this thing. Fact is, I've quite forgotten what either of them looked like. So don't either of you try to trap me into being on your side.\"  \"Speaking seriously for a moment, sir,\" Dawson said, \"what about this Herr Baron? You spoke as though you knew quite a bit about him, too.\"  \"I know a lot about that cunning devil!\" the colonel said as his face darkened. \"But how much is truth, and how much is fiction, I must confess that I do not know. I do not even know what his real name is. No doubt it is one of the dozen or more that we have in his file at the office. But which one I don't know. However--\"  The sound of the door buzzer interrupted the colonel. Everybody looked startled for an instant; then Colonel Fraser nodded at Captain Small.  \"Haines, no doubt,\" he said. \"Answer it, will you, Small?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the captain said, and went out into the foyer.  He was back in a moment or two with a slightly disappointed frown on his face.  \"It's Haines reporting, sir,\" he said to the colonel. \"Save for this apartment the entire building is vacant. They forced entrance into all of them. Not so much as a stick of furniture, sir. They found a Daimler in the garage, and Haines has detailed a man to watch it. The rear door was open, and there's an alley that leads to the street in the next block. No doubt our little friends made their exit that way, and there was a car waiting.\"  \"Of course,\" Colonel Fraser nodded gloomily. \"Too late, again. But I'll lay that blighter by the heels some day soon. Very well, Small. Tell Haines to keep searching around. Might come across something that will help us. I think you'd better lend a hand. I'll be at the office if you want me.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" Captain Small said, and went out again.  As the man closed the door behind him, Dawson glanced at his wrist watch, and started. The hands showed that the time was well after midnight.  \"Migosh!\" he gasped. \"We've been here for hours. We'll never make that Kingston train, Freddy.\"  \"Don't worry about the Kingston train,\" Colonel Fraser said, before Freddy Farmer could open his mouth. \"I want you two with me for a spell. I'll phone your C.O. and explain. Right now we're going down to my office. There's a chap whom I want to hear your story. All right, let's be off, eh?\"  Some five minutes later Dawson, Farmer, Lieutenant Faintor, and Colonel Fraser were out in front of the building on the sidewalk. Dawson looked back up at the place where death had whispered by so close, and then looked up and down the blacked out street in a half-hearted effort to determine what part of London they were in. He saw nothing but shadowy outlines and silhouettes that didn't tell him a thing.  \"Just where is this place, sir?\" he asked the colonel as Lieutenant Faintor slid in behind the wheel of a car at the curb.  \"Out Golders Green way,\" the senior officer replied. \"Get into the car, you two.\"  \"Golders Green?\" Freddy Farmer gasped as he climbed in back. \"The start of the Midlands Road? Lord! They did give us a ride, didn't they?\"  \"Well, this night has spared me one thing, at least,\" Dave Dawson grunted, as he sank down on the leather cushion beside Freddy.  \"What, I'd like to know?\" the English-born air ace demanded.  Dawson looked at him and grinned in the blackout.  \"I don't have to worry about explaining the jokes in that show to you now,\" he said gently.  Freddy Farmer didn't even comment. He simply kicked Dawson in the ankle as though it were accidental, but omitted an apology.     CHAPTER SEVEN  _Uncle Sam Steps In_   The long ride back to the War Office Building was made more or less in silence. And when Colonel Fraser ordered Lieutenant Faintor to put the car away, and led Dawson and Freddy Farmer up to his huge office, he simply waved them to comfortable chairs and promptly disappeared into an adjoining office.  Dawson looked at his own uniform and then at Freddy's.  \"Boy, I hope he's gone to call a tailor!\" he said. \"Come the light of day and we'll be picked up by the first M.P. who spots us.\"  \"Frankly, I hope he's gone to get us something to eat,\" Freddy replied. \"I'm absolutely famished.\"  \"You always are!\" Dawson grunted. \"Even at the time you're just paying the check. But that reminds me, Freddy. Remember the funny hunch I had at dinner tonight? Maybe the old feeling wasn't so far off at that, eh? Me, I must be psychic, huh?\"  \"Perhaps!\" Freddy snapped. \"But you're also a whole lot of other things that we won't bother to mention here.\"  \"I'll ignore that crack, and simply take it from whence it comes,\" Dawson said loftily. \"But would you like to make a bet, my little man?\"  \"A bet about what?\"  \"Never mind about what,\" Dawson said. \"You want to bet?\"  \"No!\" Freddy said firmly. \"I'm too tired to be roped into anything by you. By the way, though, how is that cast-iron head of yours? You're certainly acting chipper enough.\"  \"We Dawsons can take it,\" Dave grinned. \"But lay off unpleasant memories, will you? So you won't bet, huh? Well, just the same, I'll bet you anything you like that we don't go on to Kingston from here. Or back to the Squadron, either. Now, what do you think of that?\"  \"I think you're balmy!\" Freddy snorted.  \"Okay, so he thinks I'm balmy,\" Dawson said, and waved a hand. \"But I'm just telling you, that's all.\"  \"Another one of your wonderful hunches, I suppose?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],["title","Dave Dawson at Singapore (#0)"],["body","DAWSON                              AT SINGAPORE                           _by_ R.

The place of ten thousand mysteries.\"  Dave Dawson standing at his elbow chuckled softly and gave a half nod of his head.  \"Right, my little man,\" he said. \"And the place of ten thousand smells, too, according to what fellows have told me who've been there.\"  Young Farmer groaned and gave his American pal a scornful look.  \"You would say something like that,\" he grunted. \"Hard hearted to the core, that's you. No wonder you're the terror of the Nazi pilots. You've no romance in your soul, Dave. Absolutely none at all. Now, take Singapore. It's....\"  \"You take it,\" Dawson interrupted. \"Matter of fact, it was your idea in the first place. There we were, nicely settled in good old England, and what do you do but up and get itchy wings. And so here we are, three weeks later, practically over on the other side of the world. You sure do like to get around, I'll say!\"  The English youth's eyes snapped fire as he faced Dawson straddle legged and arms akimbo.  \"Well, bless my sainted aunt!\" he exploded. \"Listen to who's talking! I simply told you there was a rumor going around that Fighter pilots could put in requests for transfer to other theatres of war, now that Jerry wasn't sending so many wings over England. It was _you_, my good man, who went to the Group Commander and checked the rumor. And it was _you_ who put in a request that we _both_ go to the Far East Fleet Air Arm. Deny that, Dave Dawson, and over the side you go! And in case you don't know it, there are a lot of man-eating sharks in these waters!\"  \"Okay, okay!\" Dawson cried and threw up both hands in a token of surrender. \"But I only did it because I thought you'd enjoy the trip and the new scenery. Anyway, there's your mysterious Singapore ... unless the navigation officer aboard this battle wagon has got his calculations all messed up.\"  \"I accept your humble apology,\" Farmer said and grinned. \"So, we'll say no more about it. There's one thing, though, Dave. Why did you pick the Far East for us? There's no action out here, save hunting down a U-boat and a surface raider now and then.\"  \"No?\" Dawson grunted scornfully and pointed a hand toward the north. \"Well, a couple of thousand miles up that way there's a group of islands that are called Japan. It's full of a mess of little brown rats that even their bucktoothed Emperor Hirohito wouldn't trust any farther than he could throw an aircraft carrier. And in case you haven't been reading the newspapers for the last two or three years, Japan is a member of the Axis. The other two members are Germany and Italy. No charge for the information, my little man.\"  \"Well, thank goodness you've told me!\" Freddy Farmer snapped. \"It would be terrible to go on being so ignorant for the rest of my life. All right, so Japan is up north. What of it? Do you think they'd be mad enough to attempt to attack the British Naval Base at Singapore? It would be sheer madness. Suicide for the whole blasted lot of them.\"  \"Sweet tripe!\" Dawson groaned. \"So you've been believing that junk, too?\"  \"What junk?\" the English youth demanded.  \"The stuff the so called military experts put in the papers, and blat out over the radio,\" Dawson said. \"Look, as war veterans go, I'm just as wet behind the ears as the next fellow. But there is one thing that my war experiences, such as they've been, have taught me.\"  \"Ah, more wisdom!\" Farmer breathed. \"Tell me. I can hardly wait, Professor!\"  \"Okay, funny boy,\" Dawson said gravely. \"It is simply this, and you can take it or leave it, for all I care. But ever since Hitler's bums marched into Poland the thing that everybody believed was impossible to do was just what the enemy went out _and did_! Well, am I right or wrong?\"  The English youth didn't reply for a moment or so. He turned forward and stared at the distant horizon. The Harkness was cutting through the sun flooded waters of the China Sea at a fast clip, and the greenish-brown coastline was now well up above the level of the sea. The peaks of Malay mountains could be seen against the clear blue sky, and a little to the south was another mark on the horizon that was the Dutch owned island of Sumatra. The approaches to Singapore! A sight that one could view a million times and still be eager for another look. The Far East! Mystery, romance, treachery, and death. It all depended upon what you wanted ... and upon how you went about finding it!  Freddy Farmer shook his head as though to break the spell that gripped his thoughts and his imagination. He turned back to Dawson, and his face was grave, and his clear eyes serious.  \"Yes, you're quite right, Dave,\" he said quietly. \"The blasted enemy really has beaten us to it every time, and done the very thing we didn't even dream he would try. Then you mean...? You look for Japan to declare war against us here in the Far East, and have a go at Singapore?\"  \"Hey, hold everything, pal!\" Dawson said with a laugh. \"I'm no crystal ball gazer, and I haven't got a single secret agent in the Jap Emperor's palace. I don't know a thing. I've just got a hunch that....\"  \"Good Lord, Dawson, hunches again!\" Farmer groaned. \"I might have known it would work up to that.\"  \"So it's a hunch!\" Dave growled as his ears got red. \"But my hunches haven't all been strike-outs in the past, I might remind you. Take that time in Libya....\"  \"Spare me!\" Farmer cried. \"Didn't I have to live through it with you? Wasn't that punishment enough for my sin of knowing you? But go on with what you meant to say.\"  \"Why do I waste breath on dumb bunnies!\" Dawson sighed. \"Well, anyway, I figure the picture this way. Hitler got England's front door slammed hard on his fingers when he tried to push it open last year. In Russia the Jerries are right now receiving the biggest surprise of this war. They're getting the pants shot off them just when they thought they were going to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the Kremlin, in Moscow. And in Libya the Wops and the Jerries are setting all kinds of new Olympic distance records trying to get away from our boys out there. So, what's left? The Far East. That means Japan. I've a hunch that the Japs are only waiting for the right moment to jump. Sure, I may be all wet, and the Japs may stay in their holes. But, I've got the hunch that they won't. So.... Hey! What am I doing all this talking for, anyway!\"  \"The old American custom of letting off steam, I fancy,\" Freddy Farmer said with a chuckle. \"However, I'd not be too surprised if you were right. The blasted Japs are....\"  The English youth cut himself off short as a young pink cheeked naval lieutenant came up to them and saluted smartly.  \"Captain Standers' compliments,\" he said. \"He wishes to see you in his quarters at once.\"  Both Dawson and Farmer nodded, then looked questioningly at each other as the junior naval rating did a snappy about face and walked away.  \"The Old Man wants us?\" Freddy murmured. \"What for, I wonder?\"  \"Search me,\" Dawson said with a shrug. Then with a quick side glance at his pal, \"Unless it's for the usual thing.\"  \"Usual thing?\" Freddy Farmer echoed sharply. \"Just what do you mean?\"  Dawson jerked his head at the swiftly approaching shoreline.  \"We're getting close to port, and will be going ashore soon,\" he said. \"I suppose the Skipper wants to lay down the law to you, as usual. And get me to promise to keep an eye on you ... as usual. Well, there's one way to find out. That's to go see him. Come along, my little man.\"  Dawson turned, took one step, tripped over a foot that shot out suddenly, and went flat on his face.  \"Sorry, old thing,\" Freddy murmured, innocent eyed. \"Was my foot in your way, by any chance?\"  Dave got slowly to his feet, brushed off his uniform and glanced down over the side of the cruiser. He sighed and shook his head.  \"What's the sense?\" he growled. \"The sharks would probably throw you right back aboard!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Strange Orders_   Captain Standers, commander of the Harkness, was a true type of British sea dog in both stature and looks. His legs were as sturdy and stubby as fire hydrants. His body was like a barrel, and two muscle bulging arms hung from a"]]]
