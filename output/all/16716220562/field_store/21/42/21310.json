The same ladder that Adam climbed, until beyond the reach of the fatal consequences of his transgression, the whole human race, inheriting from him the effects of the fall, must likewise climb, or they will never see the face of God in eternal glory.  The Paramount Purpose.--Let us keep in mind, however, that the gospel, even in a limited sense, is more than a means of escape from impending ills. It is the way of progress, the path to perfection, and as such was devised by the wisdom of the Gods, before this world rolled into existence. The origin of the gospel, and the grand purpose for which it was instituted, are briefly yet clearly outlined by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the following language:  Eternal Progression.--\"The first principles of man are self-existent with God. God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with himself, so that they may have one glory upon another.\"--(\"Times and Seasons,\" August 15, 1844; \"Improvement Era,\" January, 1909.)  Power and Benevolence of Deity.--Here are pointed out both the power and the benevolence of Deity. Our Father in heaven is no monopolist. While omnipotent and all-possessing, he is likewise altruistic and philanthropic. Instead of keeping to himself the glory that he found himself possessed of, he used his superior intelligence \"to institute laws\" whereby the lesser spirits surrounding him might advance toward the lofty plane that he occupies. He proposed to lift them to his own spiritual stature and share with them the empire of the universe.  Plato's View.--Our prophet's simple yet sublime setting forth of the divine power and benevolence, as exemplified in the establishment of a plan for man's eternal progress, is far more pointed and specific than the presentment made by Plato, the Greek philosopher, of a doctrine somewhat similar. Plato, as quoted by Emerson, says: \"Let us declare the cause which led the Supreme Ordainer to produce and compose the universe. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of envy. Exempt from envy, he wished that all things should be as much as possible like himself. Whosoever, taught by wise men, shall admit this as the prime cause of the origin and foundation of the world, will be in the truth.\"--(\"Representative Men,\" Lecture II.)  Man's Destiny.--There is a fitness, a propriety, in man's becoming like his Maker--God's child, fashioned in his image and endowed with divine attributes, developing to the fulness of the parental stature, as taught by Joseph; but how the same can be predicated of \"all things\"--beasts, fish, fowl, trees, plants, etc., as Plato implies, is not so clear. That the lower animals, as well as man, in fact all forms of life, animate and inanimate, are to be perpetuated and glorified, is a plain inference from the teachings of the prophet (D&C 77:2-4) but undoubtedly all will retain their identity, in their respective orders and spheres. No creature of God's, except man, is destined to become like God, in the fullest and highest sense. \"As much as possible\" is a saving clause, however, and Plato, therefore, is not committed to any contradictory proposition.    CHAPTER II.  Eternal Nature of Gospel Principles.  Gospel Code and Fundamentals.--The gospel, as a code or System of laws and ordinances, is a creation, a work of God; but like all other creations it was organized out of materials already existing. \"Intelligence or the light of truth was not created or made, neither indeed can be\" (D&C 93:29). Truth, \"eternal, unchanged, evermore\"--such is the gospel in its fundamental principles. These were never created. God did not make them; he \"instituted\" them, recognizing their worth, their utility, their adaptability to the purposes which he had in view. He saw that these principles were ennobling and exalting in their nature and tendency, and he therefore created a plan embodying them as the most effectual means for man's promotion.  Faith.--Take, for instance, faith--the first principle. Can you conceive of its creation as a principle? I cannot: but I can grasp the idea of its existence as a law, as an essential force, its adoption by divine wisdom, and its adaptation to the purposes of Deity. I can conceive of its bestowal upon man as an endowment from God, its assimilation, cultivation, growth and increase, as illustrated in the Book of Mormon, where it is compared to a seed germinating in the soul (Alma 32:28). But I cannot think of it, in its essential, fundamental nature, as having been called into existence. Faith is a gift from God, both as a law and a manifestation of spiritual power: but it is not a creation--not as a basic principle. The gospel code containing this law, however, may readily be conceived as the work of a divine Creator and Law-giver.  Repentance.--What is true of faith in this respect, is true also of repentance. God did not create repentance as a principle; it already existed as an essential to progress; but he made it obligatory upon sinful man, if he would be saved and put upon the road to perfection, to practice this principle--to turn away from evil and \"sin no more.\"  Baptism.--As for baptism, the idea of washing in order to be come clean is plain enough for a child's comprehension. It is this idea that underlies the baptismal ordinance. God did not create the fact that washing maketh clean--that is fundamental; but he instituted baptism for the remission of sins and made it a part of the gospel plan, because no unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of heaven.  Holy Ghost.--Divine Wisdom did not create the Holy Ghost: he is eternal, without beginning or end--he is God. Nor did it decree light necessary to illumination; that is a self-evident, self-existent truth. But Divine Wisdom instituted the laying on of hands for the gift (giving) of the Holy Ghost, and included it in the great progressive plan, because, without the illumination that comes from the Spirit of the Lord, man cannot be \"led into all truth.\"  Thus we might go on, taking up other features of the gospel, and in each one pointing out some underlying principle upon which this law or that ordinance has been based. The same philosophy will apply to them all. These fundamental principles are not creations--they are eternal truths, applied or adapted to ends foreseen and predestined by the all-wise Ordainer and Giver.  The gospel was instituted for the advancement of God's children, who had probably progressed as far as they could in the spirit at that time, before they were given bodies; and it was made effective for their further progress by the Atonement of Christ, offsetting the fall of Adam, and nullifying the deadly effects of the original transgression.  The Fall.--Right here let me suggest that Adam's transgression, while technically a sin, because of the broken law, should be stressed as the means whereby those spirits obtained their bodies, rather than as an act of moral turpitude. In law, crimes are of two general classes--malum per se and malum prohibitum. Malum per se means \"an evil in itself\"--an act essentially wrong; while malum prohibitum signifies \"that which is wrong because forbidden by law.\" Adam's transgression was malum prohibitum, and the consequent descent from an immortal to a mortal condition was \"THE FALL.\"  A Prearranged Plan.--It is evident from the revelations of God, particularly in modern times, that everything connected with man's mortal pilgrimage was understood and arranged before that pilgrimage began. Not alone was the gospel instituted: an executor was appointed to put it into effect. In other words, the machinery was constructed, and the power then turned on. The fall being foreseen, the redemption was ordained. Eternal progress and everlasting glory were the objects in view, and over the glad prospect, in spite of the pain and sorrow that must necessarily intervene, \"the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for joy\" (Job 38:7).    CHAPTER III.  The Fall and Redemption.  Essentials to Progress.--The story of God embraces the fall as well as the redemption of man. Both these mighty vicissitudes are steps in the march of human progress. The fall was just as necessary as the redemption, in order to make operative and effective the laws and ordinances of the gospel. In other words, the fall prepared the way for the redemption. How could redemption have been, had there been nothing to redeem? Of what use were a gospel of salvation where nothing needed to be saved?  Innocent Ignorance.--Had the spirits of men, \"all innocent in the beginning,\" remained where they were and just as they were, they would have had no need to exercise faith unto salvation. They would have had no need to repent or to be baptized, having no evil practices to turn away from, and no uncleanness to be washed away. But they would have remained ignorant as well as innocent, and without any further progression. The following passage from the Book of Mormon illustrates this point:  \"And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen; but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever and had no end. And they would have had no children; wherefore, they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],["title","Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#2)"],["body","y\" (2 Ne. 2:22-25).  This passage, of course, refers directly to Adam's condition in the Garden of Eden, and not to the spirit life preceding that period of innocent ignorance. But the fact remains that man, in the spirit life, needed experience in mortality, in order to become wiser, as much as he needed a body for purposes of progression and eternal increase.  Adam Not Deceived.--When Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit, it was the woman who was beguiled by Satan and induced to go contrary to the divine command. The man was not deceived. Adam was but telling the truth when he answered the Lord, \"The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat\" (Gen. 3:12). Those who satirize Father Adam for this reply, imputing to him an unworthy motive, a desire to evade responsibility and \"hide behind the woman in the case,\" take but a superficial view of the subject. Adam was not trying to evade the issue: he was simply stating the fact. The Lord wanted the truth, and no fable would suffice, however polite, in the opinion of shallow wits or would-be chivalrous wisacres, it might have been to invent one, in order to shield the fair transgressor.  A Deliberate Transgression.--Adam, after Eve had transgressed, did likewise in order to carry out a divine command previously given--the command to multiply and replenish the earth (Gen. 1:28). Eve, by her act, had separated herself from her husband, and made it impossible, unless he followed her and also became mortal, to carry out God's original behest. This was Adam's motive. He was facing a dilemma. He must make choice between two divine commands, and doubtless felt that he could not consistently do otherwise than as he did. He disobeyed in order to obey, retrieving, so far as he possibly could, the situation resulting from Eve's disobedience. He did it wittingly, deliberately, undeceived as to the consequences, realizing that in no other way could he carry out God's first command and become the progenitor of the human race. Adam and Eve, with their eyes open, rejoiced over what had befallen them, recognizing it as part of a preordained plan to people the earth with their posterity, and afford to a world of waiting spirits the opportunity, long anticipated, of taking earthly tabernacles and starting out upon their great pilgrimage to perfection.  Adam and Eve Rejoice.--\"And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.  \"And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.\"--(\"Pearl of Great Price,\" Book of Moses, 5:10,11.)  \"Adam fell that man might be, and man is that he might have joy.\" But there would be no joy, no progress, no eternal life for fallen man--only pain, sorrow, and everlasting banishment from God's presence, had Christ not died to nullify the ill effects of Adam's act, and lift man up from his fallen condition.  Human Standards and Divine Dispensations.--Why, it may be asked, did God place Adam and Eve in so seemingly contradictory a position? Why were they forbidden to do what they had manifestly come to do, and which had to be done in order to carry out the divine purpose? For that is the problem in a nutshell, as it appears to human eyes. I can only answer in the words of Nephi: \"All things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.\" Man cannot sit in judgment upon his Maker, nor measure by human standards divine dispensations. The God who gives life, and takes it, without committing murder, can command today and countermand tomorrow, and yet remain consistent and unchangeable. In a world where faith is necessary to progress, and where premature knowledge would prevent progress by swallowing up faith, by destroying the opportunity for its exercise, man must not expect to know all things. That calamities and sacrifices bring forth blessings, is apparent to observation and experience; but the deep why and wherefore of it all remains a mystery. Adam's fall and Christ's atonement were fearful calamities, from the human point of view; but wonderful benefits and advantages accrued therefrom. Just why such sacrifices have to be made, however, in order that such blessings may come, is too profound a problem for the finite mind to solve.  Spiritual and Temporal Death.--The fall brought man into the world--into this state of mortality; but it also brought death, with all its sad concomitants. Not such a death as the righteous now contemplate, and such as both righteous and unrighteous must undergo, as a change preparatory to resurrection. There was no resurrection when Adam fell--not upon this planet--nothing but death, resting like a pall over the prospective human race. Adam and Eve, after the fall, were spiritually dead, and were doomed to the temporal death as well--the dissolution of the body--and they had entailed this fate upon their posterity. Hell had triumphed over man's, or rather woman's, weakness. Life was dead, death reigned, and demons held high carnival.  The World in Pawn.--Adam's transgression had put the world in pawn. The name of the pawnbroker was death, and his claim was twofold. Death held all things in his grasp, and there was no help for it this side of heaven. No part of what had been pledged could be used as the means of redemption. Adam could not redeem himself, great and mighty as he was--in the spirit; for he was no other than Michael the archangel, leader of the hosts of heaven. But this puissant Michael was now a weak, frail, mortal man, under the penalty of a broken law, and powerless to repair the injury that had been wrought. He and the race that was to spring from him were utterly lost, unless the Almighty One would intervene, and do for them what they could not do for themselves. If man could have redeemed himself, it would have been required of him; but because self-redemption was impossible, a Redeemer had to be provided.  The Redemption.--Redemption must come, if at all, through some Being high enough and powerful enough to make an infinite atonement, one fully covering the far-reaching effects of the original transgression. The scales of eternal justice, unbalanced by Adam's act, had to be repoised, and right's equilibrium restored. Who could do this? Who could retrieve the situation, bring good out of evil, mould failure into success, and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? Where was the Moses for such an exodus? Where the deliverance from this worse than Egyptian bondage--a bondage of which Egypt's slavery was but typical?  The life of a God was the price of the world's freedom, and that price was paid by the God of Israel, who descended from his glorious throne, made himself mortal, an exile of eternity, walked in the dust of his own footstool, and by submitting to death, broke the bands of death, and made it possible for man to live again, and go on to the goal of endless glory. He was the Lamb \"without spot or blemish,\" typified by the lamb of the Passover, and preordained for sacrifice, to \"take away the sins of the world.\" He gave himself as an offering, as a ransom for human redemption, and by the shedding of his own blood, paid the debt of the universe, took the world out of pawn, and became the Author of Salvation for all mankind.    CHAPTER IV.  The Gods in Council.  Fore-ordination.--The parts played by Adam and Eve in this sublime tragedy were doubtless cast at the same time that the pre-eminent role was assigned to the Redeemer and Savior. Likewise, is it just as reasonable to infer that other great ones were forechosen for service in the cause of humanity. It is more than an inference; it is a revealed fact. What other meaning can be attached to the word of the Lord to Jeremiah (1:5): \"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations\"? If this be true of Jeremiah, why not true of other prophets, both ancient and modern? Joseph Smith is on record as saying that men who have such callings to minister to the inhabitants of the world, were \"ordained to that very purpose in the grand council of heaven before this world was\" (\"Compendium,\" p. 285).  Two Plans Proposed.--In that same Grand Council--the \"congregation of the mighty\" (Ps. 1:5)--there were two candidates, if we may so designate them, for the redeemership. One was like unto the Father, desiring for the pure love of God's children to uplift them, and at the same time glorify the Great Head, by the sacrifice that he proposed to make. The other was proud, self-willed, and bent upon personal aggrandizement, regardless of consequences. The former stood for freedom--man's agency--and the rewarding of all souls according to their works. The latter proposed coercion, so that not one soul should be lost; thinking, perhaps, that his demanded compensation for proposed service might be made in that way all the more abundant.  Lucifer Rebels.--The first was chosen; the second rebelled, and was cast out, with a third of those then populating the spirit world. That third, following Lucifer, who became Satan, were doomed with him to wander up and down the earth, as fallen spirits, tempting and trying the children of men--those who, as a reward for keeping their first estate, where they \"walked by sight,\" were given a second estate--the privilege of taking tabernacles, and \"walking by faith\" through the shadowed experiences of mortality.  Upon this subject the Prophet Joseph says: \"The contention in heaven was: Jesus said there would be certain souls that would not be saved; "]]]
