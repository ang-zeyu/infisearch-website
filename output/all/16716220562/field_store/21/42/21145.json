Everyone now was shuffling uncomfortably in the hot sun, except the godsman who was exposed to the cooling air and had the godsmen's secret of escaping sunburn. And Bump-arch, who looked as uncomfortable as anybody else but did not shuffle. He stood still and straight while sweat ran down his face into the tight black neckband of an apprentice. Once he seemed to look at Snubnose and wink, or perhaps he was only winking the sweat away.  An elephant moved slowly down the Street of Ward and onto the Field of Proof. It was a ponderous metal ovoid bearing on its roof a velvet pavilion with the curtains drawn. The circle of scientists parted and opened, and the elephant, with much grinding, came to a stop a few feet from the group in the center of the Field.  The driver, an apprentice lawyer, climbed from his hole and parted the curtains of the pavilion. The High Arbiter looked out at the world with a sour expression. He did not descend.  \"I will hear the holy one first,\" he said from his roost.  The godsman raised his hands to the sun, and spoke.  \"Wise one! The Candidate and his master, abetted by the Grandmaster of the Guild of Scientists, are shamelessly defying the Principles. The Candidate is preparing to demonstrate the accelerated movement of matter into the future. That is a mystery of matter. Only the gods can know the path that things take from the dimming past to the dark future. Scientists must confine themselves to their arts and not try to steal the mysteries belonging to the gods.  \"The gods grant knowledge of mysteries to godsmen who have humbly supplicated, not to thieves. Let the scientists work to improve the fire-wheels that spin through the night seeking out the encampments of the Bowmen. Let them mix better fertilizers to sell to the Lords of the West. Let them keep in repair the ancient elephants for the honor of our exalted citizens.\"  The High Arbiter looked slightly less sour, and he nodded shortly. \"I will hear the Grandmaster of the Guild of Scientists,\" he said.  The Grandmaster lifted his head.  \"Wise one!\" he said. \"The godsman jibes, and with some basis. Generation to generation, the fire-wheels spin more slowly and seek less surely. The fertilizers grow leaner. The ceremonial elephants are fewer and worse. Perhaps the godsmen are not supplicating hard enough for solutions to mysteries of matter--solutions which would enable the scientists to control matter. In the impious days before the Principles, matter served mystery and mystery served matter, and by some inexplicable mercy of the gods, things went very well.\"  Years of banality, years of caution, years of looking to his retirement offering had, for a little while, lost their hold on him.  Snubnose was silently raging. What a place, he thought, for the Grandmaster to burst out with that kind of thing. True, scientists sometimes talked that way in the Guild social rooms, especially after drinking illegal grain distillate, but here it could only hurt Bump-arch's cause.  Snubnose looked at his friend. Bump-arch was trying to suppress a jubilant smile. Surprised, Snubnose looked at his sister. She was jumping up and down with pleasure, as he hadn't seen her do for at least two years.  \"Romantics,\" he said to himself.  The High Arbiter had a talent for looking displeased, and now he did not stint.  \"I note the Grandmaster's improper tone,\" he said stiffly. \"Furthermore, his remarks are irrelevant to the issue. The holy one says that the demonstration treats of a mystery of matter in violation of the Principles. In view of the Grandmaster's failure to refute that, it is highly probable. However, it will have to be established by authority and precedent--unless the demonstration involves an idea specifically forbidden, which would be conclusive. I will hear the holy one.\"  \"There is indeed a forbidden idea. It is known from tradition and old texts that the mathematic of accelerated movement through time involves imaginary numbers. At the conference of 1480 DRC it was confirmed that imaginary numbers are a metaphysical concept forbidden to scientists.\"  \"I will hear the Candidate's master.\"  A light cloud was filtering the sunlight, and the old man seemed cool and calm. He took a step to a little mound of good grass as if he were climbing to a rostrum.  \"Wise one! Neither the holy one nor our own Grandmaster--both devoted patriots with their minds on the welfare of the City--thought to bring one very important fact to your attention. My apprentice's demonstration is not an original experiment; it is a reconstructed experiment. By Acknowledged Custom, reconstructed experiments are permitted regardless of mysteries and ideas so long as the experimenter does not comprehend any impious theory but merely follows the practical directions of old texts.  \"I declare that my apprentice is ignorant of the theory of his demonstration--and who is in a better position to know than his master?\"  Snubnose rejoiced. He was ready to forgive even the bread and water. In a few sentences Crookback had excused the Grandmaster's rashness, had made good the Grandmaster's oversight, and had set forth a strong case for Bump-arch.  \"I will hear the holy one.\"  \"Let him prove that!\" the godsman shouted.  \"I will hear the Candidate's master.\"  \"I regret that I cannot prove it absolutely. Negatives are difficult of proof. I suggest that the Candidate swear to his ignorance by the God Mother-Father.\"  \"You should know that apprentices are not eligible to take oaths,\" the High Arbiter said impatiently, dropping the formal manner as if in a hurry to finish the proceedings--and finish Bump-arch.  Encouraged, the godsman cried, \"Let Crookback swear to it. He was willing to declare it.\"  \"Will you?\" the High Arbiter asked Crookback.  \"Though I am sure of the truth, my reverence for the God Mother-Father is too great to permit me to swear to the contents of another's mind--\"  \"That, and not wanting to be tried for false swearing,\" Snubnose muttered. He admired his old master a lot less.  \"--but I will swear by the God Mother-Father that I myself am ignorant of the theory.\"  \"What good is that?\" the godsman demanded.  Cleverly, the master stood in respectful silence. There was an awkward pause--awkward for the godsman and the High Arbiter--and then the High Arbiter collected himself and said, \"The question may be answered. I will hear the Candidate's master.\"  \"I am shocked and saddened,\" said Crookback, \"that the holy one believes that apprentices, still wearing their neckbands, excel in wisdom the masters of the guilds.\"  The High Arbiter's driver, who had been squatting meekly by the elephant, suddenly let loose a screaming laugh, which he cut off just as suddenly with a scared catch of breath.  \"I will hear the oath,\" the High Arbiter said.  Crookback swore by the God Mother-Father while the godsman glowered. The High Arbiter said, \"The demonstration may proceed. My apprentices will present my bills tomorrow, including commutation of fees for twenty journeyman lawyers, since you did not place the issue in King's Courts.\"  Everybody winced, and the elephant rumbled away.         *       *       *       *       *  The doors of the Ready Hall opened, and the whole body of apprentice scientists marched on the Field. They carried sections of steel sheet, lengths of magnesium tubing, and parts of machines unfamiliar to the guildfolk. Under Bump-arch's direction they began to assemble the equipment and to enclose it in a small building.  Bump-arch had planned well. They put the components together quickly, and marched from the Field. They had erected a cubical chamber of bright steel with an opening near the ground just big enough for a person--not too fat a person--to crawl through. Above the opening a closing panel was suspended in grooves.  The Grandmaster and the godsman and the kingsman inspected the setup with the peculiar ignorant attention of high officials. Each walked around the cube once and rapped it with his fingers here and there. Each solemnly stooped to the ground and put his head in the opening, although it was dark inside and nothing was visible. The plump godsman made a move as if to crawl in, then backed away.  The kingsman brushed dust from his cloak, and the inspection seemed to be over. The three officials and Crookback withdrew to the circle of scientists and stood just within it, a little to the left of Snubnose.  Bump-arch took hold of the door panel, the only projection on the smoothness of the cube, and scrambled to the roof, where he could be seen by the whole circle.  Now Bump-arch was really enjoying himself, Snubnose thought. And Proudwalk was enjoying Bump-arch with her big eyes.  \"Elder ones, whether my experiment succeeds or fails, the outcome will be self-evident. I make no qualifications and prepare no excuses. I will now go ahead with the demonstration.\"  Snubnose said to himself, \"It's a better performance than the High Arbiter gave on his elephant.\" He would have liked to yell some words of encouragement.  \"Before I start,\" Bump-arch added, \"as required by the Laws of the Guild, I ask, are there any among you who wish to inspect my apparatus?\"  It was no longer considered good manners to accept that invitation, but a journeyman physicist named Red-hair stepped forward. He walked very carefully, and Snubnose wondered how much grain distillate he had drunk that morning.  Before he reached the steel chamber, Red-hair yelled to the Candidate, \"Tell me how to start it. I don't like our times anyway.\"  \"It's not going very far,\" Bump-arch said easily.  \"It's not going anywhere, boy,\" Red-hair roared. \"Everybody knows that. I don't know why we've wasted so much time today.\"  \"You'd better not move any dials! There are a couple of ten-day lamps inside, if you want to look around.\"  Red-hair crawled through the opening. Five minutes later he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49767"],["title","Business For the Lawyers (#3)"],["body","out, his hair in his eyes. \"I can't make anything of it,\" he said to everybody in general, and he resumed his place in the circle.  \"Now, elder ones, does anyone else wish to inspect the apparatus?\"  \"I do!\"  It was Proudwalk.  She walked on grass and over the patches of shifting dust; walked with the graceful, slightly affected manner that had given her the name. There was the pride in her walk, and there was sexuality.  Bump-arch leaped to the ground to meet her. He bowed as if they were at the King's Councillor's Ball and he were asking her for the dance. Proudwalk touched her palms together in the stylized gesture of acceptance. Immediately she slipped through the entrance. Bump-arch stooped, and quickly followed her. The door panel dropped down its grooves, sealing the chamber.  The scientists chattered; the godsman shouted.  The kingsman raised his voice. \"What's going on, Grandmaster?\"  \"A reconstructed demonstration attempting the accelerated movement of matter through time to the relatively near future by an apprentice who, having completed the requisite service, has been admitted to candidature for the rank of journeyman physicist.\"  The Grandmaster took a breath.  \"Ask the Candidate's master,\" the godsman said, with the calmness now of more intense anger. \"You heard him trick the High Arbiter into ruling that a mystery of matter is not a mystery and a forbidden idea is not forbidden. Maybe he can convince you that a desire of matter is not a desire of matter.\"  Crookback spoke up at once. \"It would seem an unlikely place to give way to desire, but I am an old bachelor, as ignorant of the desires of matter as of its mysteries. However, young men and women frequently work together on scientific experiments.\"  \"Not in windowless boxes,\" said the kingsman. \"And who gave her leave to help the Candidate? There is something odd about this whole demonstration, and I'm going to find out what it is.\"  The kingsman strode to the little building. The sun had returned in full brightness, and the alloyed-steel walls were glistening. The kingsman glistened too: the smooth fabric of his cloak--his silver ornaments--his mace of massy silver.  Sharply he rapped with his mace on the closed door. There was afterwards silence. He rapped again. There was again silence.  The kingsman lost his temper. He brought back his mace and swung it fiercely toward the wall of the chamber.  The blow of massy silver against steel did not come. The wildly swinging arm and mace whirled through the air. The kingsman fell forward.  He sprawled, splendid and ridiculous: defeated by air.  There was no cubical building. The guildfolk faced each other across the Field. Where the steel cube had stood, the kingsman was getting to his knees.  Floating gently through the air, separating and drifting down, were many sheets of paper.  Snubnose picked up one of the papers as it fell. It was headed \"COPY OF CONTRACT\" and dated that Day of the Candidate, 155th-1712 DRC. It said: \"Hereby do Bump-arch, apprentice physicist, and Proudwalk, journeywoman biologist, contract under Private Law a marriage between them: and do undertake to dwell as husband and wife under the same roof for a period of five years in validation of this marriage: such period to terminate for purposes of the Private Law upon 155th-1717 DRC, but to continue under other roofs for the duration of their lives.\"  \"Time,\" said the Grandmaster.  Walking slowly home to face his mother, Snubnose said to himself, \"This one will keep the Guild of Lawyers busy for the duration of all our lives.\""]]]
