I'm sorry if I hurt him.\"  And Hanlon was sincere in this. He had momentarily forgotten that he was on a lighter planet, with a gravity only about 90% that of Terra, and that consequently he would naturally be stronger than the average Estrellan native. While this would not have kept him from defending himself from that sudden, vicious attack, he would have pulled his punches a bit had he thought. He did not like killing or injuring people.  But Auldin was answering, and Hanlon knew he had better be on his toes and pay strict attention. There were undertones and concepts behind the spoken words that were hard for his Terran mind to interpret.  \"You needn't be sorry,\" Auldin assured him. \"Ugen was useful, in a way, but he's stupid. I don't especially like stupid people.\" He studied Hanlon closely. \"I don't think you're stupid.\"  \"I don't know it all, by any means,\" the S S man said with disarming candor, \"but I never considered myself simple.\"  \"Now, what makes you think we are engaged in anything ... illegal ... during our evenings?\"  \"Look, nyer, let's not you and me chase ourselves around a flowertree. If I'm out of line, say so and I'll take a run. But since we're talking here together, all peaceful-like, and there's nobody within hearing distance if we talk low, let's put it on the penta, shall we, huh?\"  Ran Auldin looked at Hanlon another moment, his face and thoughts showing puzzlement at the stranger's choice of words. Then he laughed quietly. \"By Zappa, I like you, my friend. What's your name?\"  \"Gor Anlo.\"  \"You're a cool one, all right. Where are you from? I've not seen you around Stearra before.\"  \"No, I'm from Lura, over on the Eastern Continent. The goody-goodies are mostly in charge there, and there's no way for a hustler to make a fast pile. So I came here, hoping there'd be more chances for me. I've been here six-seven days, looking over the ground, and making a little investigation. The best leads pointed to your boss, Ino Yandor.\"  Auldin started at that name, and while he was staring anew at Hanlon, the latter's mind flashed back over that investigation. His first day had been spent getting the \"feel\" of the city through wide-open mental searchings. Not so much from individuals at first, but from the mass-thoughts of the many. He had later touched hundreds of minds and studied them, trying to learn how to interpret those alien thoughts. He had no trouble getting the thoughts themselves--it was what they meant that puzzled and troubled him.  Now, having noted the start Auldin made at mention of Ino Yandor's name, and the close, searching look the mobster bent toward him, Hanlon continued quickly with an appearance of great intensity and seriousness. \"I figured that I could get to him easier through one of his seconds in command, and picked on you.\"  \"One of his...?\" Auldin started to ask, then quickly changed his mind. \"Because you thought I was more weak-minded?\" There was now a hint of anger in the cold eyes.  \"Not on your life, Ran Auldin. Because I figured, after studying the set-up, that you were about ready to take over in his place one of these days, probably soon, and that would put me closer to the real power ... and the big money.\"  \"Hmmm, I see.\" Auldin was silent for some time, digesting all this in his mind. He was pleased at the compliment, but somewhat startled at two pieces of information Hanlon had so carelessly tossed out. One, that apparently Auldin was not Yandor's chief or only \"second in command\" and, two, that this stranger had so quickly and easily divined his secret ambition.  Hanlon, reading his mind, could discern and understand all this. Also, he knew when Auldin began trying to figure out whether this newcomer was legitimately on the make, or whether he was a spy sent by someone--perhaps even Yandor--to check up on him. That last statement of Hanlon's really upset him more than the first, which he had sometimes suspected. He worried about the latter now. It was the truth, all right, but he had not thought anyone else knew it or even suspected it. Did Yandor suspect it? If so, Auldin knew he was in for trouble ... bad trouble.  Hanlon decided it was time for him to do a little steering. \"Look, Auldin,\" he interrupted the other's somewhat frightened thinking. \"Why not take me to Yandor and introduce me? Let him decide whether he wants to let me in or not?\"  For a long moment Auldin stared again at Hanlon, but when he finally answered there was a note of relief in his voice he tried to conceal. Yet he was not entirely convinced that this might not be all part of an espionage trick formed in the fertile but hellishly devious mind of his superior, Ino Yandor. But Auldin was one who preferred to meet his dangers face to face ... when they could not be avoided.  \"That might not be a bad idea,\" he said as calmly as he could. \"But look, my friend. Don't try to play me for an easy fool. I'd do things about it if you did.\"  \"Sure, I know that,\" Hanlon's voice was bland and ingenuous. \"I'm not figuring on your job--being a yunner I know I've got to begin low and work up. A chance to get started is all I want ... for now.\"  Auldin rose, took some of the five-sided silver pentas from his pocket and dropped them on the table. \"Fair enough. Come on.\"  The two were mostly silent as they walked along the narrow, unpaved, crooked streets, past the not-too-tall, five-sided buildings of the mercantile establishments of this district. After a few blocks of the winding, twisted streets--\"didn't these folks ever learn anything about surveying?\" Hanlon often wondered--they turned down a tree-shaded residential street. They walked past increasingly pretentious houses, which Hanlon knew were of the ubiquitous pentagonal construction so general on this planet. It was this unusual type of buildings that Hanlon found it hard to adjust to. The first day or two on this planet and in this city the odd shapes and crooked streets had so distracted him he had trouble concentrating on his job.  Now he looked interestedly at the almost-universal green-tiled roofs, and also at the gardens of beautiful but strangely-unearthly flowers. He saw, too, the thick-trunked, low but wide-spreading flowertrees that lined the streets and were heavily planted in most of the yards surrounding the houses.  He tried, naturally, to see if these latter had any minds he could touch--ever since knowing those plant-like Guddus this had become almost automatic with him at sight of any new kind of tree, bush or plant. But he drew a blank here, as he had elsewhere. Those alien growths on Algon might be unique in the universe, he thought.  Hanlon was glad of Auldin's silence as they walked along. It enabled him to get his own thoughts in order, and to try to plan as best he could for this coming interview with Yandor, not knowing what to expect ... except that it would undoubtedly try his abilities to the utmost.  There were some slight traces of fear in his mind, for he was, after all, still a very young and inexperienced man playing a dangerous game. But his success in his first assignment--the dangers he had faced and the victories he had wrested because of his unusual and growing wild talent--thought of them brought back his self-confidence and with it an almost contemptuous view of the dangers here. There was really nothing to fear after all, he told himself. But still....  Hanlon and Auldin came to a place in the street where it climbed a fairly steep hill--there were many such throughout this city--and were nearly winded when they finally reached the top. Still wordless, they were both glad of the chance to stop and rest a moment. Then they started on again, along a much nicer part of the street, rapidly approaching the home of Ino Yandor.  This entertainment entrepreneur (that was, in effect, the nearest approach to a familiar profession of which Hanlon could think) was the one the young secret serviceman's investigations had led him to believe was the first rung on the ladder he must climb to find the knowledge that lay at the top.  \"Ah, here's the place,\" Auldin said at last, as they turned up a sort of cobbled walk leading to the fairly imposing residence. It was an ornately-decorated, two-story house, pentagonal in shape, and with a green-tiled roof, of course. The three sides Hanlon could see were painted in different, though mutually complementary colors. The surrounding lawns were made of the peculiar grass so general here, with its minutely-petalled flower-tips. There were also numerous beds of the strange, native flowers, highly-perfumed, but not heavily blossomed except in the mass.  Hanlon thought he caught large numbers of thought-emanations from animal minds of various kinds, but before he could investigate, Auldin spoke.  \"One word of warning. Don't be too eager. Yandor may seem slow thinking and calculating, but don't make the mistake of thinking him stupid. And don't irritate him--he seldom shows his temper, but he is deadly vindictive to those he takes a dislike to. But he is a good employer--and generous to those who serve him well and efficiently.\"  \"Thanks for the tip. I'll be on my good behavior.\" But Hanlon grinned to himself as he read the reason for that warning in Auldin's mind. If this stranger was spying for Yandor, he would have to make a good report on Auldin.  Then, as the mobster used the ornate knocker, Hanlon tensed himself for--literally--anything.     CHAPTER 4   After a considerable wait the door was opened. By the light from inside George Hanlon saw a fairly tall native, his hair and beard sleek and burnished from much brushing, and trimmed with unusual care. He was wearing a sort of slip-on gown of heavy cloth, probably a lounging robe. Perhaps the man had already gone to bed--in which case he would undoubtedly be quite provoked at their untimely call, Hanlon thought. Indeed, the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50863"],["title","Alien Minds (#6)"],["body","man's face showed surprise and petulance at this interruption.  But Hanlon could see shrewdness and a crafty trickiness inherent in the black eyes, that caused an inward tremor. \"I'd sure better be on my toes with this fellow,\" he thought.  Yandor scanned the two for a long moment, without a word, then beckoned them inside. But as soon as the door was shut--and locked--he turned angrily on Auldin.  \"Well now, what's the big idea, you stupid idiot, of coming here, and at night, and bringing someone with you. Are you trying to cross me, Ran? You know that isn't healthy.\"  Ran Auldin cringed somewhat and made his voice apologetic. \"It's because it was night, nyer, and we wouldn't be noticed, that I came now. Besides, I think this is important. I want you to meet Gor Anlo, who's just come from Lura, looking for a chance, he says, to get into our businesses.\"  Auldin slightly emphasized that last word, and Yandor's eyes snapped wide. He swung about and faced Hanlon, studying him carefully. The young man bore the scrutiny without flinching, a smile of greeting on his face, but without a sign of boldness or brashness.  After a moment Yandor motioned them into an adjoining room, and himself went to sit behind a large, ornate, wooden table-desk. \"Sit,\" he waved a delicate hand at the two chairs facing him in such a manner that the desk-lamp's light was strong in the faces of the two, while leaving his own more or less in the shadows. Hanlon could barely repress a grin at this--it smacked so intimately of the old Terran police-questioning technique.  During the short moments they had been in the hallway, however, Hanlon had noticed a small roch standing there, apparently one that Yandor must have partially tamed and kept as a pet. Quickly the S S man had transferred a part of his mind into that of the beast. Now, while his own body and nine-tenths of his mind were in that office room for the interview with Ino Yandor, the other tenth, inside the brain of the roch, was making the animal roam the house, seeking whatever secrets it might find there.  The impresario looked at Hanlon searchingly. \"Well now, so you think you'd like to get into the entertainment business, eh?\" he said with an attempt at joviality.  \"Yes, nyer, that ... and other things,\" Hanlon answered calmly. \"Back in Lura where I come from, sir, the people seem to be against the idea of a young fellow getting ahead in the world. So,\" shrugging, \"I came here where I thought there was a better chance of doing myself some good. Me, I'm out after a basketful of gold pentas ... and not too particular how I get 'em,\" he added levelly, but in his eyes was an unmistakable message the Estrellan could not help reading correctly.  \"But there are entertainment procurers on the Eastern Continent,\" Yandor was sparring for time to evaluate this situation better. \"If you have a good way of pleasing the people, they would be glad to take you in hand.\"  \"Anlo isn't stupid, Yandor,\" Auldin interrupted ... and Hanlon was glad he did at just that moment. For the roch had just peered through the half-open doorway of a room upstairs, and found a man, probably a servant, lying there on the bed, apparently reading from a scroll.  Hanlon did not especially like this spying on anyone, but he _had_ to learn all he could about what was going on here, no matter how he gained the information.  So he reached out and studied the man's mind. The fellow was not reading at the moment, he found, but was thinking of the \"payback\" he owed someone named Ovil Esbor, who had obtained this position for him. This Esbor was much like a Terran \"ward boss\"--a minor politician, but connected with many shady dealings. Hanlon had not previously heard that name, but made a mental note to investigate the man further. He might be another lead.  The S S man withdrew his mind after a bit, and sent the roch searching the other rooms. He noticed quite a few animal pets about the house, but thought nothing special of it at the moment. Meanwhile he, in his own person, began paying more attention to what Auldin and Yandor were saying.  \"... been in town several days, he says, looking over the situation. How he found out I don't know, but he knows _all_ our businesses.\"  Yandor barely repressed a start of surprise, and his crafty black eyes narrowed. \"Why are you spying on ... no, _who_ are you spying on us _for_?\" he demanded in cold tones that again sent a shiver down Hanlon's spine. For there was no mercy or lack of ruthlessness in that tone. Nor in the man's attitude. Yet, at the same time, the young man realized stunningly that Yandor, too, was as much afraid of _his_ superior as Auldin was of Yandor ... and Hanlon knew after a fleet scanning of the gangster's mind that he now felt relief that Yandor had not been investigating him through Hanlon.  But the young S S man had been reading the impresario's thoughts as best he could, as well as hearing what he was saying. He felt that he knew now how to handle this agent.  \"As Auldin said, I'm not stupid, and I am on the make for my fortune. I knew the only way was to check first and talk later. So I asked seemingly innocuous questions here and there--and I'm wise enough never to ask more than one from any one person. That way I found out a lot. I do know something about the entertainment business and can hold up my end of the performance. But I also know the really big money is in the other things you control.\"  Yandor did gasp at that. His face grew black and he half-rose and opened his mouth to say something--but Hanlon beat him to it.  \"Incidentally,\" he lowered his voice but still kept it penetrant as he leaned forward confidentially, \"there's someone in the next room, listening through that door there, to what we're saying.\"  At Hanlon's quiet words, Ino Yandor's eyes opened wide, while Ran Auldin barely repressed an exclamation. Neither guessed, of course, that the stranger was looking through the eyes of Yandor's pet roch which, in the course of its investigation of the house for Hanlon's benefit, had come to the open doorway of that adjoining room, and had seen the man kneeling there, his ear pressed against the door-panels, listening intently.  Now Yandor reached into a sort of pigeon-hole in his table-desk and quietly took out a flamegun. Tensing himself, he suddenly swung his chair about and leaped to the door. Flinging it open he found, indeed, another man there, before that other could rise and run.  Grabbing the spy's collar with one surprisingly strong hand, Yandor yanked him to his feet and into the light.  \"_Ondo!_\" he exclaimed. \"Well now, what in the name of Zappa were you doing?\"  The small man cringed. \"Pardon, nyer, I was ... was only trying to make sure that no one was attempting to harm you ... and ... and standing by to help you if they were.\"  \"I think he's lying,\" Hanlon said, knowing from his quick probe into the other's mind that he was. \"I'll bet he's a spy for someone.\"  This last, he knew however, was not correct. Ondo was regularly employed by Yandor as a houseman. But he was one of those intensely curious and inquisitive people who always try to find out everything that goes on in any house they happen to be working in.  \"By Zappa, you'll never spy again,\" Yandor's face grew livid. \"You know better'n to cross me. You know it isn't healthy.\"  And before anyone could guess what he was about to do, the raging impresario chopped down with the butt of his flamer, and Ondo fell unconscious to the floor, blood welling from a gash in his forehead. The furious entrepreneur was swinging the weapon into firing position to kill the fallen man when Hanlon leaped forward and grasped his arm, holding him back.  \"Wait, nyer. Don't cinder him,\" he said almost in a tone of command. \"It wouldn't look well for a man of your public position, if word of it ever leaked out.\"  \"I say kill the snake,\" Ran Auldin spat. \"There's no sense taking chances with a man we know is a spy.\"  \"No!\" Hanlon was still quietly determined to save Ondo's life. He spoke as impressively as he could. \"Such a killing, with a body to dispose of, would most certainly be traced back to you in time, nyer, and you would lose much of the respect the public holds for you. Your success in your ... other ... endeavors is largely due to the fact that everyone knows you for such a high-principled, public-spirited citizen, that no one suspects you of being anything else. Don't take chances on spoiling that reputation.\"  Yandor was swayed by this impassioned appeal, it was plain to be seen. His respect for Hanlon's quick good sense and sound judgment mounted, and he looked at the young man with new interest.  \"Anlo's right, Ran,\" he told his lieutenant. \"We mustn't have a killing on our hands that can be so easily traced to us.\"  He turned back to Hanlon, who was grinning inwardly at Yandor's almost-panic that made him forget for the moment that there were no real police detectives on this world who could so easily trace back a killing, especially if only ordinary precautions were used to dispose of the body.  \"Well now, I thank you for saving me from the risk my temper might have caused. What would you suggest we do with this ... this ...\", he pushed at the body with his foot.  \"It's easy to see that Ondo is only a scared rat, and when he wakes up he'll know he'd better keep away from you or he'll really be killed,\" Hanlon spoke carelessly. \"Just have Auldin take him out and dump him on the next street. Ondo will never bother you again, I'm positive.\"  Auldin seemed about to protest, but Yandor forestalled him. \"That's good advice. Take care of it, Auldin.\"  And after the gangster had left the house with his burden, Yandor resumed his seat and motioned Hanlon to take the one he had formerly occupied. But while they were doing this, the young S S man had sent his mind outdoors, found a sleeping bird and taken over its mind. He made it follow Auldin, so he would know where Ondo's body was"]]]
