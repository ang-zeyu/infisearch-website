There never was a Fox yet smart enough to do a thing that a Coyote cannot do if he tries. I think I’ll slip up where I can watch Farmer Brown’s and see what is going on up there. Yes, Sir, that’s what I’ll do.”  With this, Old Man Coyote grinned and then curled himself up for a short nap, for he was tired.     CHAPTER XX A Twice Stolen Dinner   No one ever is so smart that some one else may not prove to be smarter still.           —_Old Granny Fox_.   Listen and you shall hear all about three rogues. Two were in red and were Granny and Reddy Fox. And one was in gray and was Old Man Coyote. They were the slyest, smartest rogues on all the Green Meadows or in all the Green Forest. All three had started out to steal the same dinner, but the funny part is they didn’t intend to steal it from the same person. And still funnier is it that one of them didn’t even know where that dinner was or what kind of a dinner it would be.  True to his resolve to know what Granny and Reddy Fox were getting to eat, and where they were getting it, Old Man Coyote hid where he could see what was going on about Farmer Brown’s, for it was there he felt sure that Granny and Reddy were getting food. He had waited only a little while when along came Granny and Reddy Fox past the place where Old Man Coyote was hiding. They didn’t see him. Of course not. He took care that they should have no chance. But anyway, they were not thinking of him. Their thoughts were all of that dinner they intended to have, and the smart trick by which they would get it.  So with their thoughts all on that dinner they slipped up behind the barn and prepared to work the trick which had been so successful before. Old Man Coyote crept after them. He saw Reddy Fox lie down where he could peep around the corner of the barn to watch Bowser the Hound and to see that no one else was about. He saw Granny leave Reddy there and hurry away. Old Man Coyote’s wits worked fast.  “I can’t be in two places at once,” thought he, “so I can’t watch both Granny and Reddy. As I can watch but one, which one shall it be? Granny, of course. Granny is the smartest of the two, and whatever they are up to, she is at the bottom of it. Granny is the one to follow.”  So, like a gray shadow, crafty Old Man Coyote stole after Granny Fox and saw her hide behind the corner of the shed at the end of which was the little house of Bowser the Hound. He crept as near as he dared and then lay flat down behind a little bunch of dead grass close to the shed. For some time nothing happened, and Old Man Coyote was puzzled. Every once in a while Granny Fox would look behind and all about to be sure that no danger was near, but she didn’t see Old Man Coyote. After what seemed to him a long time, he heard a door open on the other side of the shed. It was Mrs. Brown carrying Bowser’s dinner out to him. Of course, Old Man Coyote didn’t know this. He knew by the sounds that some one had come out of the house, and it made him nervous. He didn’t like being so close to Farmer Brown’s house in broad daylight. But he kept his eyes on Granny Fox, and he saw her ears prick up in a way that he knew meant that those sounds were just what she had been waiting for.  “If she isn’t afraid, I don’t need to be,” thought he craftily. After a few minutes he heard a door close and knew that whoever had come out had gone back into the house. Almost at once Bowser the Hound began to yelp and whine. Swiftly Granny Fox disappeared around the corner of the shed. Just as swiftly Old Man Coyote ran forward and peeped around the corner. There was Bowser the Hound tugging at his chain, and just beyond his reach was Reddy Fox, grinning in the most provoking manner. And there was Granny Fox, backing and dragging after her Bowser’s dinner. In a flash Old Man Coyote understood the plan, and he almost chuckled aloud at the cleverness of it. Then he hastily backed behind the shed and waited. In a minute Granny Fox appeared, dragging Bowser’s dinner. She was so intent on getting that dinner that she almost backed into Old Man Coyote without suspecting that he was anywhere about.  “Thank you, Granny. You needn’t bother about it any longer; I’ll take it now,” growled Old Man Coyote in Granny’s ear.  Granny let go of that dinner as if it burned her tongue, and with a frightened little yelp leaped to one side. A minute later Reddy came racing around from behind the barn eager for his share. What he saw was Old Man Coyote bolting down that twice-stolen dinner while Granny Fox fairly danced with rage.     CHAPTER XXI Granny And Reddy Talk Things Over.   You’ll find as on through life you go     The thing you want may prove to be The very thing you shouldn’t have.     Then seeming loss is gain, you see.           —_Old Granny Fox_.   If ever two folks were mad away through, those two were Granny and Reddy Fox as they watched Old Man Coyote gobble up the dinner they had so cleverly stolen from Bowser the Hound. It was bad enough to lose the dinner, but it was worse to see some one else eat it after they had worked so hard to get it. “Robber!” snarled Granny. Old Man Coyote stopped eating long enough to grin.  “Thief! Sneak! Coward!” snarled Reddy. Once more Old Man Coyote grinned. When that dinner had disappeared down his throat to the last and smallest crumb, he licked his chops and turned to Granny and Reddy.  “I’m very much obliged for that dinner,” said he pleasantly, his eyes twinkling with mischief. “It was the best dinner I have had for a long time. Allow me to say that that trick of yours was as smart a trick as ever I have seen. It was quite worthy of a Coyote. You are a very clever old lady, Granny Fox. Now I hear some one coming, and I would suggest that it will be better for all concerned if we are not seen about here.”  He darted off behind the barn like a gray streak, and Granny and Reddy followed, for it was true that some one was coming. You see Bowser the Hound had discovered that something was going on around the corner of the shed, and he made such a racket that Mrs. Brown had come out of the house to see what it was all about. By the time she got around there, all she saw was the empty pan which had held Bowser’s dinner. She was puzzled. How that pan could be where it was she couldn’t understand, and Bowser couldn’t tell her, although he tried his very best. She had been puzzled about that pan two or three times before.  Old Man Coyote lost no time in getting back home, for he never felt easy near the home of man in broad daylight. Granny and Reddy Fox went home too, and there was hate in their hearts,—hate for Old Man Coyote. But once they reached home, Old Granny Fox stopped growling, and presently she began to chuckle.  “What are you laughing at?” demanded Reddy.  “At the way Old Man Coyote stole that dinner from us,” replied Granny.  “I hate him! He’s a sneaking robber!” snapped Reddy.  “Tut, tut, Reddy! Tut, tut!” retorted Granny. “Be fair-minded. We stole that dinner from Bowser the Hound, and Old Man Coyote stole it from us. I guess he is no worse than we are, when you come to think it over. Now is he?”  “I—I—well, I don’t suppose he is, when you put it that way,” Reddy admitted grudgingly.  “And he was smart, very smart, to outwit two such clever people as we are,” continued Granny. “You will have to agree to that.”  “Y-e-s,” said Reddy slowly. “He was smart enough, but—”  “There isn’t any but, Reddy,” interrupted Granny. “You know the law of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. It is everybody for himself, and anything belongs to one who has the wit or the strength to take it. We had the wit to take that dinner from Bowser the Hound, and Old Man Coyote had the wit to take it from us and the strength to keep it. It was all fair enough, and you know there isn’t the least use in crying over spilled milk, as the saying is. We simply have got to be smart enough not to let him fool us again. I guess we won’t get any more of Bowser’s dinners for a while. We’ve got to think of some other way of filling our stomachs when the hunting is poor. I think if I could have just one of those fat hens of Farmer Brown’s, it would put new strength into my old bones. All summer I warned you to keep away from that henyard, but the time has come now when I think we might try for a couple of those hens.”  Reddy pricked up his ears at the mention of fat hens. “I think so too,” said he. “When shall we try for one?”  “To-morrow morning,” replied Granny. “Now don’t bother me while I think out a plan.”     CHAPTER XXII Granny Fox Plans To Get A Fat Hen   Full half success for Fox or Man Is won by working out a plan.           —_Old Granny Fox_.   Granny Fox knows this. No one knows it better. Whatever she does is first carefully planned in her wise old head. So now after she had decided that she and Reddy would try for one of Farmer Brown’s fat hens, she lay down to think out a plan to get that fat hen. No one knew better than she how foolish it would be to go over to that henyard and just trust to luck for a chance to catch one of those biddies. Of course, they _might_ be lucky and get a hen that way, but then again they might be unlucky and get in a peck of trouble.  “You see,” said she to Reddy, “we must not only plan how to get that fat hen, but we must also plan how to get away with it safely. If only there was some way of getting in that henhouse at night, there would be no trouble at all. I don’t suppose there is the least chance of that.”  “Not the least chance in the world,” replied Reddy. “There isn’t a hole anywhere big enough for even Shadow the Weasel to get through, and Farmer Brown’s boy is very careful to lock the door every night.”  “There’s a little hole that the hens go in and out of during the day, which is big enough for one of us to slip through, I believe,” said Granny thoughtfully.  “Sure! But it’s always closed at night,” snapped Reddy. “Besides, to get to that or the door either, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49809"],["title","Junior (#0)"],["body","By ROBERT ABERNATHY                           Illustrated by WEISS       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January      1956. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.      copyright on this publication was renewed.]        _All younger generations have been going to the dogs ... but this      one was genuinely sunk!_   \"Junior!\" bellowed Pater.  \"_Junior!_\" squeaked Mater, a quavering echo.  \"Strayed off again--the young idiot! If he's playing in the shallows, with this tide going out....\" Pater let the sentence hang blackly. He leaned upslope as far as he could stretch, angrily scanning the shoreward reaches where light filtered more brightly down through the murky water, where the sea-surface glinted like bits of broken mirror.  No sign of Junior.  Mater was peering fearfully in the other direction, toward where, as daylight faded, the slope of the coastal shelf was fast losing itself in green profundity. Out there, out of sight at this hour, the reef that loomed sheltering above them fell away in an abrupt cliffhead, and the abyss began.  \"Oh, oh,\" sobbed Mater. \"He's lost. He's swum into the abyss and been eaten by a sea monster.\" Her slender stem rippled and swayed on its base and her delicate crown of pinkish tentacles trailed disheveled in the pull of the ebbtide.  \"Pish, my dear!\" said Pater. \"There are no sea monsters. At worst,\" he consoled her stoutly, \"Junior may have been trapped in a tidepool.\"  \"Oh, oh,\" gulped Mater. \"He'll be eaten by a land monster.\"  \"There ARE no land monsters!\" snorted Pater. He straightened his stalk so abruptly that the stone to which he and Mater were conjugally attached creaked under them. \"How often must I assure you, my dear, that WE are the highest form of life?\" (And, as for his world and geologic epoch, he was quite right.)  \"Oh, oh,\" gasped Mater.  Her spouse gave her up. \"JUNIOR!\" he roared in a voice that loosened the coral along the reef.         *       *       *       *       *  Round about, the couple's bereavement had begun attracting attention. In the thickening dusk, tentacles paused from winnowing the sea for their owners' suppers, stalked heads turned curiously here and there in the colony. Not far away, a threesome of maiden aunts, rooted en brosse to a single substantial boulder, twittered condolences and watched Mater avidly.  \"Discipline!\" growled Pater. \"That's what he needs! Just wait till I--\"  \"Now, dear--\" began Mater shakily.  \"Hi, folks!\" piped Junior from overhead.  His parents swiveled as if on a single stalk. Their offspring was floating a few fathoms above them, paddling lazily against the ebb; plainly he had just swum from some crevice in the reef nearby. In one pair of dangling tentacles he absently hugged a roundish stone, worn sensuously smooth by pounding surf.  \"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?\"  \"Nowhere,\" said Junior innocently. \"Just playing hide-and-go-sink with the squids.\"  \"With the other polyps,\" Mater corrected him primly. She detested slang.  Pater was eyeing Junior with ominous calm. \"And where,\" he asked, \"did you get that stone?\"  Junior contracted guiltily. The surfstone slipped from his tentacles and plumped to the sea-floor in a flurry of sand. He edged away, stammering, \"Well, I guess maybe ... I might have gone a little ways toward the beach....\"  \"You guess! When I was a polyp,\" said Pater, \"the small fry obeyed their elders, and no guess about it!\"  \"Now, dear--\" said Mater.  \"And no spawn of mine,\" Pater warmed to his lecture, \"is going to flout my words! Junior--COME HERE!\"  Junior paddled cautiously around the homesite, just out of tentacle-reach. He said in a small voice, \"I won't.\"  \"DID YOU HEAR ME?\"  \"Yes,\" admitted Junior.  The neighbors stared. The three maiden aunts clutched one another with muted shrieks, savoring beforehand the language Pater would now use.  But Pater said \"Ulp!\"--no more.  \"Now, dear,\" put in Mater quickly. \"We must be patient. You know all children go through larval stages.\"  \"When I was a polyp ...\" Pater began rustily. He coughed out an accidentally inhaled crustacean, and started over: \"No spawn of mine....\" Trailing off, he only glared, then roared abruptly, \"SPRAT!\"  \"I won't!\" said Junior reflexively and backpaddled into the coral shadows of the reef.  \"That wallop,\" seethed Pater, \"wants a good polyping. I mean....\" He glowered suspiciously at Mater and the neighbors.  \"Dear,\" soothed Mater, \"didn't you _notice_?\"  \"Of course, I.... Notice what?\"  \"What Junior was doing ... carrying a stone. I don't suppose he understands _why_, just yet, but....\"  \"A stone? Ah, uh, to be sure, a stone. Why, my dear, do you realize what this _means_?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Pater was once more occupied with improving Mater's mind. It was a long job, without foreseeable end--especially since he and his helpmeet were both firmly rooted for life to the same tastefully decorated homesite (garnished by Pater himself with colored pebbles, shells, urchins and bits of coral in the rather rococo style which had prevailed during Pater's courting days as a free-swimming polyp).  \"Intelligence, my dear,\" pronounced Pater, \"is quite incompatible with motility. Just think--how could ideas congeal in a brain shuttled hither and yon, bombarded with ever-changing sense-impressions? Look at the lower species, which swim about all their lives, incapable of taking root or thought! True Intelligence, my dear--as distinguished from Instinct, of course--pre-supposes the fixed viewpoint!\" He paused.  Mater murmured, \"Yes, dear,\" as she always did obediently at this point.  Junior undulated past, swimming toward the abyss. He moved a bit heavily now; it was growing hard for him to keep his maturely thickening afterbody in a horizontal posture.  \"Just look at the young of our own kind,\" said Pater. \"Scatter-brained larvae, wandering greedily about in search of new stimuli. But, praise be, they mature at last into sensible sessile adults. While yet the unformed intellect rebels against the ending of care-free polyphood, Instinct, the wisdom of Nature, instructs them to prepare for the great change!\"  He nodded wisely as Junior came gliding back out of the gloom of deep water. Junior's tentacles clutched an irregular basalt fragment which he must have picked up down the rubble-strewn slope. As he paddled slowly along the rim of the reef, the adult anthozoans located directly below looked up and hissed irritable warnings.  He was swimming a bit more easily now and, if Pater had not been a firm believer in Instinct, he might have been reminded of the grossly materialistic theory, propounded by some iconoclast, according to which a maturing polyp's tendency to grapple objects was merely a matter of taking on ballast.  \"See!\" declared Pater triumphantly. \"I don't suppose he understands _why_, just yet ... but Instinct urges him infallibly to assemble the materials for his future homesite.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Junior let the rock fragment fall, and began plucking restlessly at a coral outcropping.  \"Dear,\" said Mater, \"don't you think you ought to tell him...?\"  \"Ahem!\" said Pater. \"The wisdom of Instinct--\"  \"As you've always said, a polyp needs a parent's guidance,\" remarked Mater.  \"_Ahem!_\" repeated Pater. He straightened his stalk, and bellowed authoritatively, \"JUNIOR! Come here!\"  The prodigal polyp swam warily close. \"Yes, Pater?\"  \"Junior,\" said his parent solemnly, \"now that you are about to grow down, it behooves you to know certain facts.\"  Mater blushed a delicate lavender and turned away on her side of the rock.  \"Very soon now,\" said Pater, \"you will begin feeling an irresistible urge ... to sink to the bottom, to take root there in some sheltered location which will be your lifetime site. Perhaps you even have an understanding already with some ... ah ... charming young polyp of the opposite gender, whom you would invite to share your homesite. Or, if not, you should take all the more pains to make that site as attractive as possible, in order that such a one may decide to grace it with--\"  \"Uh-huh,\" said Junior understandingly. \"That's what the fellows mean when they say any of 'em'll fall for a few high-class rocks.\"  Pater marshaled his thoughts again. \"Well, quite apart from such material considerations as selecting the right rocks, there are certain ... ah ... matters we do not ordinarily discuss.\"  Mater blushed a more pronounced lavender. The three maiden aunts, rooted to their boulder within easy earshot of Pater's carrying voice, put up a respectable pretense of searching one another for nonexistent water-fleas.  \"No doubt,\" said Pater, \"in the course of your harum-scarum adventurings as a normal polyp among polyps, you've noticed the ways in which the lower orders reproduce themselves; the activities of the fishes, the crustacea, the marine worms will not have escaped your attention.\"  \"Uh-huh,\" said Junior, treading water.         *       *       *       *       *  \"You will have observed that among these there takes place a good deal of ... ah ... maneuvering for position. But among intelligent, firmly rooted beings like ourselves, matters are, of course, on a less crude and direct plane. What among lesser creatures is a question of tactics belongs, for us, to the realm of strategy.\" Pater's tone grew confiding. \"Now, Junior, once you're settled you'll realize the importance of being easy in your mind about your offspring's parentage. Remember, a niche in brine saves trying. Nothing like choosing your location well in the first place. Study the currents around your prospective site--particularly their direction and force at such crucial times as flood-tide. Try to make sure you and your future mate won't be too close down-current from anybody else's site, since in a case like that accidents can happen. You understand, Junior?\"  \"Uh-huh,\" acknowledged Junior. \"That's what the fellows mean "]]]
