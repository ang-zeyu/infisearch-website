But they soon got used to it; and they used to think it great fun to watch Jip, the dog, sweeping his tail over the floor with a rag tied onto it for a broom. After a little they got to do the work so well that the Doctor said that he had never had his house kept so tidy or so clean before.  In this way things went along all right for a while; but without money they found it very hard.  Then the animals made a vegetable and flower stall outside the garden-gate and sold radishes and roses to the people that passed by along the road.  But still they didn’t seem to make enough money to pay all the bills—and still the Doctor wouldn’t worry. When the parrot came to him and told him that the fishmonger wouldn’t give them any more fish, he said,  “Never mind. So long as the hens lay eggs and the cow gives milk we can have omelettes and junket. And there are plenty of vegetables left in the garden. The Winter is still a long way off. Don’t fuss. That was the trouble with Sarah—she would fuss. I wonder how Sarah’s getting on—an excellent woman—in some ways—Well, well!”  But the snow came earlier than usual that year; and although the old lame horse hauled in plenty of wood from the forest outside the town, so they could have a big fire in the kitchen, most of the vegetables in the garden were gone, and the rest were covered with snow; and many of the animals were really hungry.     _THE FOURTH CHAPTER_  A MESSAGE FROM AFRICA   THAT Winter was a very cold one. And one night in December, when they were all sitting round the warm fire in the kitchen, and the Doctor was reading aloud to them out of books he had written himself in animal-language, the owl, Too-Too, suddenly said,  “Sh! What’s that noise outside?”  They all listened; and presently they heard the sound of some one running. Then the door flew open and the monkey, Chee-Chee, ran in, badly out of breath.  “Doctor!” he cried, “I’ve just had a message from a cousin of mine in Africa. There is a terrible sickness among the monkeys out there. They are all catching it—and they are dying in hundreds. They have heard of you, and beg you to come to Africa to stop the sickness.”  “Who brought the message?” asked the Doctor, taking off his spectacles and laying down his book.  “A swallow,” said Chee-Chee. “She is outside on the rain-butt.”  “Bring her in by the fire,” said the Doctor. “She must be perished with the cold. The swallows flew South six weeks ago!”  So the swallow was brought in, all huddled and shivering; and although she was a little afraid at first, she soon got warmed up and sat on the edge of the mantelpiece and began to talk.  When she had finished the Doctor said,  “I would gladly go to Africa—especially in this bitter weather. But I’m afraid we haven’t money enough to buy the tickets. Get me the money-box, Chee-Chee.”  So the monkey climbed up and got it off the top shelf of the dresser.  There was nothing in it—not one single penny!  “I felt sure there was twopence left,” said the Doctor.  “There _was_” said the owl. “But you spent it on a rattle for that badger’s baby when he was teething.”  “Did I?” said the Doctor—“dear me, dear me! What a nuisance money is, to be sure! Well, never mind. Perhaps if I go down to the seaside I shall be able to borrow a boat that will take us to Africa. I knew a seaman once who brought his baby to me with measles. Maybe he’ll lend us his boat—the baby got well.”  [Illustration: “‘I felt sure there was twopence left’”]  So early the next morning the Doctor went down to the sea-shore. And when he came back he told the animals it was all right—the sailor was going to lend them the boat.  Then the crocodile and the monkey and the parrot were very glad and began to sing, because they were going back to Africa, their real home. And the Doctor said,  “I shall only be able to take you three—with Jip the dog, Dab-Dab the duck, Gub-Gub the pig and the owl, Too-Too. The rest of the animals, like the dormice and the water-voles and the bats, they will have to go back and live in the fields where they were born till we come home again. But as most of them sleep through the Winter, they won’t mind that—and besides, it wouldn’t be good for them to go to Africa.”  So then the parrot, who had been on long sea-voyages before, began telling the Doctor all the things he would have to take with him on the ship.  “You must have plenty of pilot-bread,” she said—“‘hard tack’ they call it. And you must have beef in cans—and an anchor.”  “I expect the ship will have its own anchor,” said the Doctor.  “Well, make sure,” said Polynesia. “Because it’s very important. You can’t stop if you haven’t got an anchor. And you’ll need a bell.”  “What’s that for?” asked the Doctor.  “To tell the time by,” said the parrot. “You go and ring it every half-hour and then you know what time it is. And bring a whole lot of rope—it always comes in handy on voyages.”  Then they began to wonder where they were going to get the money from to buy all the things they needed.  “Oh, bother it! Money again,” cried the Doctor. “Goodness! I shall be glad to get to Africa where we don’t have to have any! I’ll go and ask the grocer if he will wait for his money till I get back—No, I’ll send the sailor to ask him.”  So the sailor went to see the grocer. And presently he came back with all the things they wanted.  Then the animals packed up; and after they had turned off the water so the pipes wouldn’t freeze, and put up the shutters, they closed the house and gave the key to the old horse who lived in the stable. And when they had seen that there was plenty of hay in the loft to last the horse through the Winter, they carried all their luggage down to the seashore and got on to the boat.  The Cat’s-meat-Man was there to see them off; and he brought a large suet-pudding as a present for the Doctor because, he said he had been told, you couldn’t get suet-puddings in foreign parts.  As soon as they were on the ship, Gub-Gub, the pig, asked where the beds were, for it was four o’clock in the afternoon and he wanted his nap. So Polynesia took him downstairs into the inside of the ship and showed him the beds, set all on top of one another like book-shelves against a wall.  “Why, that isn’t a bed!” cried Gub-Gub. “That’s a shelf!”  “Beds are always like that on ships,” said the parrot. “It isn’t a shelf. Climb up into it and go to sleep. That’s what you call ‘a bunk.’”  [Illustration: “And the voyage began”]  “I don’t think I’ll go to bed yet,” said Gub-Gub. “I’m too excited. I want to go upstairs again and see them start.”  “Well, this is your first trip,” said Polynesia. “You will get used to the life after a while.” And she went back up the stairs of the ship, humming this song to herself,      I’ve seen the Black Sea and the Red Sea;       I rounded the Isle of Wight;     I discovered the Yellow River,       And the Orange too—by night.     Now Greenland drops behind again,       And I sail the ocean Blue.     I’m tired of all these colors, Jane,       So I’m coming back to you.  They were just going to start on their journey, when the Doctor said he would have to go back and ask the sailor the way to Africa.  But the swallow said she had been to that country many times and would show them how to get there.  So the Doctor told Chee-Chee to pull up the anchor and the voyage began.     _THE FIFTH CHAPTER_  THE GREAT JOURNEY   NOW for six whole weeks they went sailing on and on, over the rolling sea, following the swallow who flew before the ship to show them the way. At night she carried a tiny lantern, so they should not miss her in the dark; and the people on the other ships that passed said that the light must be a shooting star.  As they sailed further and further into the South, it got warmer and warmer. Polynesia, Chee-Chee and the crocodile enjoyed the hot sun no end. They ran about laughing and looking over the side of the ship to see if they could see Africa yet.  But the pig and the dog and the owl, Too-Too, could do nothing in such weather, but sat at the end of the ship in the shade of a big barrel, with their tongues hanging out, drinking lemonade.  Dab-Dab, the duck, used to keep herself cool by jumping into the sea and swimming behind the ship. And every once in a while, when the top of her head got too hot, she would dive under the ship and come up on the other side. In this way, too, she used to catch herrings on Tuesdays and Fridays—when everybody on the boat ate fish to make the beef last longer.  When they got near to the Equator they saw some flying-fishes coming towards them. And the fishes asked the parrot if this was Doctor Dolittle’s ship. When she told them it was, they said they were glad, because the monkeys in Africa were getting worried that he would never come. Polynesia asked them how many miles they had yet to go; and the flying-fishes said it was only fifty-five miles now to the coast of Africa.  And another time a whole school of porpoises came dancing through the waves; and they too asked Polynesia if this was the ship of the famous doctor. And when they heard that it was, they asked the parrot if the Doctor wanted anything for his journey.  And Polynesia said, “Yes. We have run short of onions.”  “There is an island not far from here,” said the porpoises, “where the wild onions grow tall and strong. Keep straight on—we will get some and catch up to you.”  So the porpoises dashed away through the sea. And very soon the parrot saw them again, coming up behind, dragging the onions through the waves in big nets made of seaweed.  The next evening, as the sun was going down, the Doctor said,  “Get me the telescope, Chee-Chee. Our journey is nearly ended. Very soon we should be able to see the shores of Africa.”  And about half an hour later, sure enough, they thought they could see something in front that might be land. But it began to get darker and darker and they couldn’t be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/501"],["title","The Story of Doctor Dolittle (#4)"],["body","ure.  Then a great storm came up, with thunder and lightning. The wind howled; the rain came down in torrents; and the waves got so high they splashed right over the boat.  Presently there was a big BANG! The ship stopped and rolled over on its side.  “What’s happened?” asked the Doctor, coming up from downstairs.  “I’m not sure,” said the parrot; “but I think we’re ship-wrecked. Tell the duck to get out and see.”  So Dab-Dab dived right down under the waves. And when she came up she said they had struck a rock; there was a big hole in the bottom of the ship; the water was coming in; and they were sinking fast.  “We must have run into Africa,” said the Doctor. “Dear me, dear me!—Well—we must all swim to land.”  But Chee-Chee and Gub-Gub did not know how to swim.  “Get the rope!” said Polynesia. “I told you it would come in handy. Where’s that duck? Come here, Dab-Dab. Take this end of the rope, fly to the shore and tie it on to a palm-tree; and we’ll hold the other end on the ship here. Then those that can’t swim must climb along the rope till they reach the land. That’s what you call a ‘life-line.’”  [Illustration: “‘We must have run into Africa’”]  So they all got safely to the shore—some swimming, some flying; and those that climbed along the rope brought the Doctor’s trunk and hand-bag with them.  But the ship was no good any more—with the big hole in the bottom; and presently the rough sea beat it to pieces on the rocks and the timbers floated away.  Then they all took shelter in a nice dry cave they found, high up in the cliffs, till the storm was over.  When the sun came out next morning they went down to the sandy beach to dry themselves.  “Dear old Africa!” sighed Polynesia. “It’s good to get back. Just think—it’ll be a hundred and sixty-nine years to-morrow since I was here! And it hasn’t changed a bit!—Same old palm-trees; same old red earth; same old black ants! There’s no place like home!”  And the others noticed she had tears in her eyes—she was so pleased to see her country once again.  Then the Doctor missed his high hat; for it had been blown into the sea during the storm. So Dab-Dab went out to look for it. And presently she saw it, a long way off, floating on the water like a toy-boat.  When she flew down to get it, she found one of the white mice, very frightened, sitting inside it.  “What are you doing here?” asked the duck. “You were told to stay behind in Puddleby.”  “I didn’t want to be left behind,” said the mouse. “I wanted to see what Africa was like—I have relatives there. So I hid in the baggage and was brought on to the ship with the hard-tack. When the ship sank I was terribly frightened—because I cannot swim far. I swam as long as I could, but I soon got all exhausted and thought I was going to sink. And then, just at that moment, the old man’s hat came floating by; and I got into it because I did not want to be drowned.”  So the duck took up the hat with the mouse in it and brought it to the Doctor on the shore. And they all gathered round to have a look.  “That’s what you call a ‘stowaway,’” said the parrot.  Presently, when they were looking for a place in the trunk where the white mouse could travel comfortably, the monkey, Chee-Chee, suddenly said,  “Sh! I hear footsteps in the jungle!”  They all stopped talking and listened. And soon a black man came down out of the woods and asked them what they were doing there.  [Illustration: “‘I got into it because I did not want to be drowned’”]  “My name is John Dolittle—M.D.,” said the Doctor. “I have been asked to come to Africa to cure the monkeys who are sick.”  “You must all come before the King,” said the black man.  “What king?” asked the Doctor, who didn’t want to waste any time.  “The King of the Jolliginki,” the man answered. “All these lands belong to him; and all strangers must be brought before him. Follow me.”  So they gathered up their baggage and went off, following the man through the jungle.     _THE SIXTH CHAPTER_  POLYNESIA AND THE KING   WHEN they had gone a little way through the thick forest, they came to a wide, clear space; and they saw the King’s palace which was made of mud.  This was where the King lived with his Queen, Ermintrude, and their son, Prince Bumpo. The Prince was away fishing for salmon in the river. But the King and Queen were sitting under an umbrella before the palace door. And Queen Ermintrude was asleep.  When the Doctor had come up to the palace the King asked him his business; and the Doctor told him why he had come to Africa.  “You may not travel through my lands,” said the King. “Many years ago a white man came to these shores; and I was very kind to him. But after he had dug holes in the ground to get the gold, and killed all the elephants to get their ivory tusks, he went away secretly in his ship— without so much as saying ‘Thank you.’ Never again shall a white man travel through the lands of Jolliginki.”  [Illustration: “And Queen Ermintrude was asleep”]  Then the King turned to some of the black men who were standing near and said, “Take away this medicine-man—with all his animals, and lock them up in my strongest prison.”  So six of the black men led the Doctor and all his pets away and shut them up in a stone dungeon. The dungeon had only one little window, high up in the wall, with bars in it; and the door was strong and thick.  Then they all grew very sad; and Gub-Gub, the pig, began to cry. But Chee-Chee said he would spank him if he didn’t stop that horrible noise; and he kept quiet.  “Are we all here?” asked the Doctor, after he had got used to the dim light.  “Yes, I think so,” said the duck and started to count them.  “Where’s Polynesia?” asked the crocodile. “She isn’t here.”  “Are you sure?” said the Doctor. “Look again. Polynesia! Polynesia! Where are you?”  “I suppose she escaped,” grumbled the crocodile. “Well, that’s just like her!—Sneaked off into the jungle as soon as her friends got into trouble.”  “I’m not that kind of a bird,” said the parrot, climbing out of the pocket in the tail of the Doctor’s coat. “You see, I’m small enough to get through the bars of that window; and I was afraid they would put me in a cage instead. So while the King was busy talking, I hid in the Doctor’s pocket—and here I am! That’s what you call a ‘ruse,’” she said, smoothing down her feathers with her beak.  “Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “You’re lucky I didn’t sit on you.”  “Now listen,” said Polynesia, “to-night, as soon as it gets dark, I am going to creep through the bars of that window and fly over to the palace. And then—you’ll see—I’ll soon find a way to make the King let us all out of prison.”  “Oh, what can _you_ do?” said Gub-Gub, turning up his nose and beginning to cry again. “You’re only a bird!”  “Quite true,” said the parrot. “But do not forget that although I am only a bird, _I can talk like a man_—and I know these darkies.”  So that night, when the moon was shining through the palm-trees and all the King’s men were asleep, the parrot slipped out through the bars of the prison and flew across to the palace. The pantry window had been broken by a tennis ball the week before; and Polynesia popped in through the hole in the glass.  She heard Prince Bumpo snoring in his bedroom at the back of the palace. Then she tip-toed up the stairs till she came to the King’s bedroom. She opened the door gently and peeped in.  The Queen was away at a dance that night at her cousin’s; but the King was in bed fast asleep.  Polynesia crept in, very softly, and got under the bed.  Then she coughed—just the way Doctor Dolittle used to cough. Polynesia could mimic any one.  The King opened his eyes and said sleepily: “Is that you, Ermintrude?” (He thought it was the Queen come back from the dance.)  Then the parrot coughed again—loud, like a man. And the King sat up, wide awake, and said, “Who’s that?”  “I am Doctor Dolittle,” said the parrot—just the way the Doctor would have said it.  “What are you doing in my bedroom?” cried the King. “How dare you get out of prison! Where are you?—I don’t see you.”  [Illustration: “‘Who’s that?’”]  But the parrot just laughed—a long, deep* jolly laugh, like the Doctor’s.  “Stop laughing and come here at once, so I can see you,” said the King.  “Foolish King!” answered Polynesia. “Have you forgotten that you are talking to John Dolittle, M.D.—the most wonderful man on earth? Of course you cannot see me. I have made myself invisible. There is nothing I cannot do. Now listen: I have come here to-night to warn you. If you don’t let me and my animals travel through your kingdom, I will make you and all your people sick like the monkeys. For I can make people well: and I can make people ill—just by raising my little finger. Send your soldiers at once to open the dungeon door, or you shall have mumps before the morning sun has risen on the hills of Jolliginki.”  Then the King began to tremble and was very much afraid.  “Doctor,” he cried, “it shall be as you say. Do not raise your little finger, please!” And he jumped out of bed and ran to tell the soldiers to open the prison door.  As soon as he was gone, Polynesia crept downstairs and left the palace by the pantry window.  But the Queen, who was just letting herself in at the backdoor with a latch-key, saw the parrot getting out through the broken glass. And when the King came back to bed she told him what she had seen.  Then the King understood that he had been tricked, and he was dreadfully angry. He hurried back to the prison at once.  But he was too late. The door stood open. The dungeon was empty. The Doctor and all his animals were gone.     _THE SEVENTH CHAPTER_  THE BRIDGE OF APES   QUEEN ERMINTRUDE had never in her life seen her husband so terrible as he got that night. He gnashed his teeth with rage. He called everybody a fool. He threw his tooth-brush at the palace cat. He rushed round in his night-shirt and woke up all his army and sent them into the jungle to catch the Doctor. Then he made "]]]
