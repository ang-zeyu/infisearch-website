It was mostly women, and the women began to look vaguely familiar, as if they could be members of the sewing circle.  I put my lips close to the ear of the pretty usher while I turned over the stiff printed bulletin on a hunch. \"How long has the League been organized?\" On the back of the bulletin was a constitution.  She was cheering with the crowd, her eyes sparkling. \"I don't know,\" she answered between cheers. \"I only joined two days ago. Isn't it wonderful?\"  I went into the quiet outer air and got into my car with my skin prickling. Even as I drove away, I could hear them. They were singing some kind of organization song with the tune of \"Marching through Georgia.\"  Even at the single glance I had given it, the constitution looked exactly like the one we had given the Watashaw Sewing Circle.  All I told Caswell when I got back was that the sewing circle had changed its name and the membership seemed to be rising.         *       *       *       *       *  Next day, after calling Mrs. Searles, I placed some red stars on my graph for the first three months. They made a nice curve, rising more steeply as it reached the fourth month. They had picked up their first increase in membership simply by amalgamating with all the other types of charity organizations in Watashaw, changing the club name with each fusion, but keeping the same constitution--the constitution with the bright promise of advantages as long as there were always new members being brought in.  By the fifth month, the League had added a mutual baby-sitting service and had induced the local school board to add a nursery school to the town service, so as to free more women for League activity. But charity must have been completely organized by then, and expansion had to be in other directions.  Some real estate agents evidently had been drawn into the whirlpool early, along with their ideas. The slum improvement plans began to blossom and take on a tinge of real estate planning later in the month.  The first day of the sixth month, a big two page spread appeared in the local paper of a mass meeting which had approved a full-fledged scheme for slum clearance of Watashaw's shack-town section, plus plans for rehousing, civic building, and rezoning. _And_ good prospects for attracting some new industries to the town, industries which had already been contacted and seemed interested by the privileges offered.  And with all this, an arrangement for securing and distributing to the club members _alone_ most of the profit that would come to the town in the form of a rise in the price of building sites and a boom in the building industry. The profit distributing arrangement was the same one that had been built into the organization plan for the distribution of the small profits of membership fees and honorary promotions. It was becoming an openly profitable business. Membership was rising more rapidly now.  By the second week of the sixth month, news appeared in the local paper that the club had filed an application to incorporate itself as the Watashaw Mutual Trade and Civic Development Corporation, and all the local real estate promoters had finished joining en masse. The Mutual Trade part sounded to me as if the Chamber of Commerce was on the point of being pulled in with them, ideas, ambitions and all.  I chuckled while reading the next page of the paper, on which a local politician was reported as having addressed the club with a long flowery oration on their enterprise, charity, and civic spirit. He had been made an honorary member. If he allowed himself to be made a _full_ member with its contractual obligations and its lures, if the politicians went into this, too....  I laughed, filing the newspaper with the other documents on the Watashaw test. These proofs would fascinate any businessman with the sense to see where his bread was buttered. A businessman is constantly dealing with organizations, including his own, and finding them either inert, cantankerous, or both. Caswell's formula could be a handle to grasp them with. Gratitude alone would bring money into the university in carload lots.         *       *       *       *       *  The end of the sixth month came. The test was over and the end reports were spectacular. Caswell's formulas were proven to the hilt.  After reading the last newspaper reports, I called him up.  \"Perfect, Wilt, _perfect_! I can use this Watashaw thing to get you so many fellowships and scholarships and grants for your department that you'll think it's snowing money!\"  He answered somewhat disinterestedly, \"I've been busy working with students on their research papers and marking tests--not following the Watashaw business at all, I'm afraid. You say the demonstration went well and you're satisfied?\"  He was definitely putting on a chill. We were friends now, but obviously he was still peeved whenever he was reminded that I had doubted that his theory could work. And he was using its success to rub my nose in the realization that I had been wrong. A man with a string of degrees after his name is just as human as anyone else. I had needled him pretty hard that first time.  \"I'm satisfied,\" I acknowledged. \"I was wrong. The formulas work beautifully. Come over and see my file of documents on it if you want a boost for your ego. Now let's see the formula for stopping it.\"  He sounded cheerful again. \"I didn't complicate that organization with negatives. I wanted it to _grow_. It falls apart naturally when it stops growing for more than two months. It's like the great stock boom before an economic crash. Everyone in it is prosperous as long as the prices just keep going up and new buyers come into the market, but they all knew what would happen if it stopped growing. You remember, we built in as one of the incentives that the members know they are going to lose if membership stops growing. Why, if I tried to stop it now, they'd cut my throat.\"  I remembered the drive and frenzy of the crowd in the one early meeting I had seen. They probably would.  \"No,\" he continued. \"We'll just let it play out to the end of its tether and die of old age.\"  \"When will that be?\"  \"It can't grow past the female population of the town. There are only so many women in Watashaw, and some of them don't like sewing.\"  The graph on the desk before me began to look sinister. Surely Caswell must have made some provision for--  \"You underestimate their ingenuity,\" I said into the phone. \"Since they wanted to expand, they didn't stick to sewing. They went from general charity to social welfare schemes to something that's pretty close to an incorporated government. The name is now the Watashaw Mutual Trade and Civic Development Corporation, and they're filing an application to change it to Civic Property Pool and Social Dividend, membership contractual, open to all. That social dividend sounds like a Technocrat climbed on the band wagon, eh?\"  While I spoke, I carefully added another red star to the curve above the thousand member level, checking with the newspaper that still lay open on my desk. The curve was definitely some sort of log curve now, growing more rapidly with each increase.  \"Leaving out practical limitations for a moment, where does the formula say it will stop?\" I asked.  \"When you run out of people to join it. But after all, there are only so many people in Watashaw. It's a pretty small town.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"They've opened a branch office in New York,\" I said carefully into the phone, a few weeks later.  With my pencil, very carefully, I extended the membership curve from where it was then.  After the next doubling, the curve went almost straight up and off the page.  Allowing for a lag of contagion from one nation to another, depending on how much their citizens intermingled, I'd give the rest of the world about twelve years.  There was a long silence while Caswell probably drew the same graph in his own mind. Then he laughed weakly. \"Well, you asked me for a demonstration.\"  That was as good an answer as any. We got together and had lunch in a bar, if you can call it lunch. The movement we started will expand by hook or by crook, by seduction or by bribery or by propaganda or by conquest, but it will expand. And maybe a total world government will be a fine thing--until it hits the end of its rope in twelve years or so.  What happens then, I don't know.  But I don't want anyone to pin that on me. From now on, if anyone asks me, I've never heard of Watashaw."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50774"],["title","Contagion (#0)"],["body","By KATHERINE MacLEAN             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                  Galaxy Science Fiction October 1950.

Not a thing                seemed wrong with it. Excepting the food,               perhaps. And a disease that wasn't really.   It was like an Earth forest in the fall, but it was not fall. The forest leaves were green and copper and purple and fiery red, and a wind sent patches of bright greenish sunlight dancing among the leaf shadows.  The hunt party of the _Explorer_ filed along the narrow trail, guns ready, walking carefully, listening to the distant, half familiar cries of strange birds.  A faint crackle of static in their earphones indicated that a gun had been fired.  \"Got anything?\" asked June Walton. The helmet intercom carried her voice to the ears of the others without breaking the stillness of the forest.  \"Took a shot at something,\" explained George Barton's cheerful voice in her earphones. She rounded a bend of the trail and came upon Barton standing peering up into the trees, his gun still raised. \"It looked like a duck.\"  \"This isn't Central Park,\" said Hal Barton, his brother, coming into sight. His green spacesuit struck an incongruous note against the bronze and red forest. \"They won't all look like ducks,\" he said soberly.  \"Maybe some will look like dragons. Don't get eaten by a dragon, June,\" came Max's voice quietly into her earphones. \"Not while I still love you.\" He came out of the trees carrying the blood sample kit, and touched her glove with his, the grin on his ugly beloved face barely visible in the mingled light and shade. A patch of sunlight struck a greenish glint from his fishbowl helmet.         *       *       *       *       *  They walked on. A quarter of a mile back, the space ship _Explorer_ towered over the forest like a tapering skyscraper, and the people of the ship looked out of the viewplates at fresh winds and sunlight and clouds, and they longed to be outside.  But the likeness to Earth was danger, and the cool wind might be death, for if the animals were like Earth animals, their diseases might be like Earth diseases, alike enough to be contagious, different enough to be impossible to treat. There was warning enough in the past. Colonies had vanished, and traveled spaceways drifted with the corpses of ships which had touched on some plague planet.  The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtight spacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion.  The four medicos, for June Walton was also a doctor, filed through the alien homelike forest, walking softly, watching for motion among the copper and purple shadows.  They saw it suddenly, a lighter moving copper patch among the darker browns. Reflex action swung June's gun into line, and behind her someone's gun went off with a faint crackle of static, and made a hole in the leaves beside the specimen. Then for a while no one moved.  This one looked like a man, a magnificently muscled, leanly graceful, humanlike animal. Even in its callused bare feet, it was a head taller than any of them. Red-haired, hawk-faced and darkly tanned, it stood breathing heavily, looking at them without expression. At its side hung a sheath knife, and a crossbow was slung across one wide shoulder.  They lowered their guns.  \"It needs a shave,\" Max said reasonably in their earphones, and he reached up to his helmet and flipped the switch that let his voice be heard. \"Something we could do for you, Mac?\"  The friendly drawl was the first voice that had broken the forest sounds. June smiled suddenly. He was right. The strict logic of evolution did not demand beards; therefore a non-human would not be wearing a three day growth of red stubble.  Still panting, the tall figure licked dry lips and spoke. \"Welcome to Minos. The Mayor sends greetings from Alexandria.\"  \"English?\" gasped June.  \"We were afraid you would take off again before I could bring word to you.... It's three hundred miles.... We saw your scout plane pass twice, but we couldn't attract its attention.\"         *       *       *       *       *  June looked in stunned silence at the stranger leaning against the tree. Thirty-six light years--thirty-six times six trillion miles of monotonous space travel--to be told that the planet was already settled! \"We didn't know there was a colony here,\" she said. \"It is not on the map.\"  \"We were afraid of that,\" the tall bronze man answered soberly. \"We have been here three generations and yet no traders have come.\"  Max shifted the kit strap on his shoulder and offered a hand. \"My name is Max Stark, M.D. This is June Walton, M.D., Hal Barton, M.D., and George Barton, Hal's brother, also M.D.\"  \"Patrick Mead is the name,\" smiled the man, shaking hands casually. \"Just a hunter and bridge carpenter myself. Never met any medicos before.\"  The grip was effortless but even through her airproofed glove June could feel that the fingers that touched hers were as hard as padded steel.  \"What--what is the population of Minos?\" she asked.  He looked down at her curiously for a moment before answering. \"Only one hundred and fifty.\" He smiled. \"Don't worry, this isn't a city planet yet. There's room for a few more people.\" He shook hands with the Bartons quickly. \"That is--you are people, aren't you?\" he asked startlingly.  \"Why not?\" said Max with a poise that June admired.  \"Well, you are all so--so--\" Patrick Mead's eyes roamed across the faces of the group. \"So varied.\"  They could find no meaning in that, and stood puzzled.  \"I mean,\" Patrick Mead said into the silence, \"all these--interesting different hair colors and face shapes and so forth--\" He made a vague wave with one hand as if he had run out of words or was anxious not to insult them.  \"Joke?\" Max asked, bewildered.  June laid a hand on his arm. \"No harm meant,\" she said to him over the intercom. \"We're just as much of a shock to him as he is to us.\"  She addressed a question to the tall colonist on outside sound. \"What should a person look like, Mr. Mead?\"  He indicated her with a smile. \"Like you.\"  June stepped closer and stood looking up at him, considering her own description. She was tall and tanned, like him; had a few freckles, like him; and wavy red hair, like his. She ignored the brightly humorous blue eyes.  \"In other words,\" she said, \"everyone on the planet looks like you and me?\"  Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin. \"Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think that people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit so many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I suppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside down!\" He laughed and sobered. \"But then why wear spacesuits? The air is breathable.\"  \"For safety,\" June told him. \"We can't take any chances on plague.\"  Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons, and the wind ruffled his hair. He looked comfortable, and they longed to take off the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins. Minos was like home, like Earth.... But they were strangers.  \"Plague,\" Pat Mead said thoughtfully. \"We had one here. It came two years after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead families. They were immune. I guess we look alike because we're all related, and that's why I grew up thinking that it is the only way people can look.\"  _Plague._ \"What was the disease?\" Hal Barton asked.  \"Pretty gruesome, according to my father. They called it the melting sickness. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to do about it.\"  \"You should have trained for more doctors, or sent to civilization for some.\" A trace of impatience was in George Barton's voice.  Pat Mead explained patiently, \"Our ship, with the power plant and all the books we needed, went off into the sky to avoid the contagion, and never came back. The crew must have died.\" Long years of hardship were indicated by that statement, a colony with electric power gone and machinery stilled, with key technicians dead and no way to replace them. June realized then the full meaning of the primitive sheath knife and bow.  \"Any recurrence of melting sickness?\" asked Hal Barton.  \"No.\"  \"Any other diseases?\"  \"Not a one.\"  Max was eyeing the bronze red-headed figure with something approaching awe. \"Do you think all the Meads look like that?\" he said to June on the intercom. \"I wouldn't mind being a Mead myself!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Their job had been made easy by the coming of Pat. They went back to the ship laughing, exchanging anecdotes with him. There was nothing now to keep Minos from being the home they wanted, except the melting sickness, and, forewarned against it, they could take precautions.  The polished silver and black column of the _Explorer_ seemed to rise higher and higher over the trees as they neared it. Then its symmetry blurred all sense of specific size as they stepped out from among the trees and stood on the edge of the meadow, looking up.  \"Nice!\" said Pat. \"Beautiful!\" The admiration in his voice was warming.  \"It was a yacht,\" Max said, still looking up, \"second hand, an old-time beauty without a sign of wear. Synthetic diamond-studded control board and murals on the walls. It doesn't have the new speed drives, but it brought us thirty-six light years in one and a half subjective years. Plenty good enough.\"  The tall tanned man looked faintly wistful, and June realized that he had never had access to a full library, never seen a movie, never experienced luxury. He had been born and raised on Minos.         *       *       *       *       *  \"May I go aboard?\" Pat asked hopefully.  Max unslung the specimen kit from"]]]
