'_... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love--and all our own!--than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known...._'  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the dreams.  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would look out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing but seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again. The dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he couldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would die. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into himself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one compensation--he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them who had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way across the Cosmos.  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him much more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He could switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.  \"Bruce--Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure to be five hundred thousand feet! It _is_ impossible. We keep climbing and now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is going up and up--\"  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the matter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps laughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it. Women don't have real guts.\"  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled softly at the door.  \"Marsha,\" he said.  \"Bruce--\"  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember how you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I never thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't matter....\"  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper. \"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and hysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish I were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that? I really love you, after all. After all....\"  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest mountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and warm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What are you doing--reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was that, Bruce--that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last night before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the mike. He got through to her.  \"Hello, hello, darling,\" he whispered. \"Marsha, can you hear me?\"  \"Yes, yes. You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling. Where you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she looked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with Marsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of that hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her, as he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren rocks.      \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,       But down, my dear;     And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley       Will never seem fresh or clear     For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water       In the feathery green of the year....'\"  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound of his own voice.  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\" Terrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into any signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our destiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and we'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're going up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the top, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a thousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this world--the top of _everything_. The top of the UNIVERSE!\"  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or other--Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all--and turned into crazy yells that faded out and never came back.  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe they were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He knew they would never come back down.  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration break over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an instant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film negatives.  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was out there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet sunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there was a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the softly flowing canal water.  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent, drifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass wavered down the wind.  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same, but useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this one, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from that world into this one of his dreams?  The girl--Helene--was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a cigarette.  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but now he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between them. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown. She was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at because she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only what was.  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row of spaceships--not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd relics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships instead of four.  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building, and the other buildings. He looked up.  There was no mountain.         *       *       *       *       *  For one shivery moment he knew fear. And then the fear went away, and he was ashamed of what he had felt. What he had feared was gone now, and he knew it was gone for good and he would never have to fear it again.  \"Look here, Bruce. I wondered how long it would take to get it through that thick poetic head of yours!\"  \"Get what?\" He began to suspect what it was all about now, but he wasn't quite sure yet.  \"Smoke?\" she said.  He took one of the cigarettes and she lighted it for him and put the lighter back into her pocket.  \"It's real nice here,\" she said. \"Isn't it?\"  \"I guess it's about perfect.\"  \"It'll be easy. Staying here, I mean. We won't be going to Earth ever again, you know.\"  \"I didn't _know_ that, but I didn't _think_ we ever would again.\"  \"We wouldn't want to anyway, would we, Bruce?\"  \"No.\"  He kept on looking at the place where the mountain had been. Or maybe it still was; he couldn't make up his mind yet. Which was and which was not? That barren icy world without life, or this?  \"'_Is all that we see or seem_,'\" he whispered, half to himself, \"'_but a dream within a dream?_'\"  She laughed softly. \"Poe was ahead of his time,\" she said. \"You still don't get it, do you? You don't know what's been happening?\"  \"Maybe I don't.\"  She shrugged, and looked in the direction of the ships. \"Poor guys. I can't feel much hatred toward them now. The Martians give you a lot of understanding of the human mind--after they've accepted you, and after you've lived with them awhile. But the mountain climbers--we can see now--it's just luck, chance, we weren't like them. A deviant is a child of chance.\"  \"Yes,\" Bruce said. \"There's a lot of people like us on Earth, but they'll never get the chance--the chance we seem to have here, to live decently....\"  \"You're beginning to see now which was the dream,\" she said and smiled. \"But don't be pessimistic. Those people on Earth will get their chance, too, one of these fine days. The Conquerors aren't getting far. Venus, and then Mars, and Mars is where they stop. They'll keep coming here and climbing the mountain and finally there won't be any more. It won't take so long.\"  She rose to her toes and waved and yelled. Bruce saw Pietro and Marlene walking hand in hand up the other side of the canal. They waved back and called and then pushed off into the water in a small boat, and drifted away and out of sight around a gentle turn.  She took his arm and they walked along the canal toward where the mountain had been, or still was--he didn't know.  A quarter of a mile beyond the canal, he saw the high mound of red, naked hill, corroded and ugly, rising up like a scar of the surrounding green.  She wasn't smiling now. There were shadows on her face as the pressure on his arm stopped him.  \"I was on the first ship and Marlene on the second. None like us on the third, and on the fourth ship was Pietro. All the others had to climb the mountain--\" She stopped talking for a moment, and then he felt the pressure of her fingers on his arm. \"I'm very glad you came on the fifth,\" she whispered. \"Are you glad now?\"  \"I'm very glad,\" he said.  \"The Martians tested us,\" she explained. \"They're masters of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50868"],["title","The Highest Mountain (#3)"],["body","mind. I guess they've been grinding along through the evolutionary mill a darn long time, longer than we could estimate now. They learned the horror we're capable of from the first ship--the Conquerors, the climbers. The Martians knew more like them would come and go on into space, killing, destroying for no other reason than their own sickness. Being masters of the mind, the Martians are also capable of hypnosis--no, that's not really the word, only the closest our language comes to naming it. Suggestion so deep and strong that it seems real to one human or a million or a billion; there's no limit to the number that can be influenced. What the people who came off those ships saw wasn't real. It was partly what the Martians wanted them to see and feel--but most of it, like the desire to climb the mountain, was as much a part of the Conquerors' own psychic drive as it was the suggestion of the Martians.\"  She waved her arm slowly to describe a peak. \"The Martians made the mountain real. So real that it could be seen from space, measured by instruments ... even photographed and chipped for rock samples. But you'll see how that was done, Bruce, and realize that this and not the mountain of the Conquerors is the reality of Mars. This is the Mars no Conqueror will ever see.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They walked toward the ugly red mound that jutted above the green. When they came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains, actually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on walking.  \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that there is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it, either, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is given an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the Conquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had to.\"  He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded hills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied together with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond them were those from _Mars V_, too freshly dead to have decayed much ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and Marsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed to climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched out, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds, red elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve miles from the ship--horizontally.  Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the fresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace beside the canal.  He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that other time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so much, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of Helene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently flowing water of the cool, green canal.  \"You loved her?\"  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she was young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd been older when they got her.\"  He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the leaves floating down it.  \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never seem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water in the feathery green of the year....'\"  He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm city. He didn't look back.  \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet I seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago. Are--are the climbers still climbing--somewhere, Helene?\"  \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe. I doubt if even the Martians have the answer to that.\"  They entered the city."]]]
