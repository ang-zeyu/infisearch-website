Can it be a shade shall tear from me the purple,    A sound deprive my children of succession?    Fool that I was! Of what was I afraid?    Blow on this phantom--and it is no more.    So, I am fast resolved; I'll show no sign    Of fear, but nothing must be held in scorn.    Ah! Heavy art thou, crown of Monomakh!     CRACOW. HOUSE OF VISHNEVETSKY  The PRETENDER and a CATHOLIC PRIEST     PRETENDER. Nay, father, there will be no trouble. I know    The spirit of my people; piety    Does not run wild in them, their tsar's example    To them is sacred. Furthermore, the people    Are always tolerant. I warrant you,    Before two years my people all, and all    The Eastern Church, will recognise the power    Of Peter's Vicar.     PRIEST.         May Saint Ignatius aid thee    When other times shall come. Meanwhile, tsarevich,    Hide in thy soul the seed of heavenly blessing;    Religious duty bids us oft dissemble    Before the blabbing world; the people judge    Thy words, thy deeds; God only sees thy motives.     PRETENDER. Amen. Who's there?     (Enter a Servant.)                       Say that we will receive them.     (The doors are opened; a crowd of Russians and Poles enters.)     Comrades! Tomorrow we depart from Cracow.    Mnishek, with thee for three days in Sambor    I'll stay. I know thy hospitable castle    Both shines in splendid stateliness, and glories    In its young mistress; There I hope to see    Charming Marina. And ye, my friends, ye, Russia    And Lithuania, ye who have upraised    Fraternal banners against a common foe,    Against mine enemy, yon crafty villain.    Ye sons of Slavs, speedily will I lead    Your dread battalions to the longed-for conflict.    But soft! Methinks among you I descry    New faces.     GABRIEL P. They have come to beg for sword    And service with your Grace.     PRETENDER.                 Welcome, my lads.    You are friends to me. But tell me, Pushkin, who    Is this fine fellow?     PUSHKIN.           Prince Kurbsky.     PRETENDER. (To KURBSKY.)    A famous name!    Art kinsman to the hero of Kazan?     KURBSKY. His son.     PRETENDER. Liveth he still?     KURBSKY.                  Nay, he is dead.     PRETENDER. A noble soul! A man of war and counsel.    But from the time when he appeared beneath    The ancient town Olgin with the Lithuanians,    Hardy avenger of his injuries,    Rumour hath held her tongue concerning him.     KURBSKY. My father led the remnant of his life    On lands bestowed upon him by Batory;    There, in Volhynia, solitary and quiet,    Sought consolation for himself in studies;    But peaceful labour did not comfort him;    He ne'er forgot the home of his young days,    And to the end pined for it.     PRETENDER.                 Hapless chieftain!    How brightly shone the dawn of his resounding    And stormy life! Glad am I, noble knight,    That now his blood is reconciled in thee    To his fatherland. The faults of fathers must not    Be called to mind. Peace to their grave. Approach;    Give me thy hand! Is it not strange?--the son    Of Kurbsky to the throne is leading--whom?    Whom but Ivan's own son?--All favours me;    People and fate alike.--Say, who art thou?     A POLE. Sobansky, a free noble.     PRETENDER.              Praise and honour    Attend thee, child of liberty. Give him    A third of his full pay beforehand.--Who    Are these? On them I recognise the dress    Of my own country. These are ours.     KRUSHCHOV. (Bows low.)           Yea, Sire,    Our father; we are thralls of thine, devoted    And persecuted; we have fled from Moscow,    Disgraced, to thee our tsar, and for thy sake    Are ready to lay down our lives; our corpses    Shall be for thee steps to the royal throne.     PRETENDER. Take heart, innocent sufferers. Only let me    Reach Moscow, and, once there, Boris shall settle    Some scores with me and you. What news of Moscow?     KRUSHCHOV. As yet all there is quiet. But already    The folk have got to know that the tsarevich    Was saved; already everywhere is read    Thy proclamation. All are waiting for thee.    Not long ago Boris sent two boyars    To execution merely because in secret    They drank thy health.     PRETENDER.           O hapless, good boyars!    But blood for blood! And woe to Godunov!    What do they say of him?     KRUSHCHOV.             He has withdrawn    Into his gloomy palace. He is grim    And sombre. Executions loom ahead.    But sickness gnaws him. Hardly hath he strength    To drag himself along, and--it is thought--    His last hour is already not far off.     PRETENDER. A speedy death I wish him, as becomes    A great-souled foe to wish. If not, then woe    To the miscreant!--And whom doth he intend    To name as his successor?     KRUSHCHOV.              He shows not    His purposes, but it would seem he destines    Feodor, his young son, to be our tsar.     PRETENDER. His reckonings, maybe, will yet prove wrong.    Who art thou?     KARELA.     A Cossack; from the Don I am sent    To thee, from the free troops, from the brave hetmen    From upper and lower regions of the Cossacks,    To look upon thy bright and royal eyes,    And tender thee their homage.     PRETENDER.                  Well I knew    The men of Don; I doubted not to see    The Cossack hetmen in my ranks. We thank    Our army of the Don. Today, we know,    The Cossacks are unjustly persecuted,    Oppressed; but if God grant us to ascend    The throne of our forefathers, then as of yore    We'll gratify the free and faithful Don.     POET. (Approaches, bowing low, and taking Gregory by the    hem of his caftan.)    Great prince, illustrious offspring of a king!     PRETENDER. What wouldst thou?     POET.                       Condescendingly accept    This poor fruit of my earnest toil.     PRETENDER.                        What see I?    Verses in Latin! Blest a hundredfold    The tie of sword and lyre; the selfsame laurel    Binds them in friendship. I was born beneath    A northern sky, but yet the Latin muse    To me is a familiar voice; I love    The blossoms of Parnassus, I believe    The prophecies of singers. Not in vain    The ecstasy boils in their flaming breast;    Action is hallowed, being glorified    Beforehand by the poets! Approach, my friend.    In memory of me accept this gift.     (Gives him a ring.)     When fate fulfils for me her covenant,    When I assume the crown of my forefathers,    I hope again to hear the measured tones    Of thy sweet voice, and thy inspired lay.    Musa gloriam Coronat, gloriaque musam.    And so, friends, till tomorrow, au revoir.     ALL. Forward! Long live Dimitry! Forward, forward!    Long live Dimitry, the great prince of Moscow!     CASTLE OF THE GOVERNOR  MNISHEK IN SAMBOR     Dressing-Room of Marina     MARINA, ROUZYA (dressing her), Serving-Women     MARINA.    (Before a mirror.) Now then, is it ready? Cannot    you make haste?     ROUZYA. I pray you first to make the difficult choice;    Will you the necklace wear of pearls, or else    The emerald half-moon?     MARINA.              My diamond crown.     ROUZYA. Splendid! Do you remember that you wore it    When to the palace you were pleased to go?    They say that at the ball your gracious highness    Shone like the sun; men sighed, fair ladies whispered--    'Twas then that for the first time young Khotkevich    Beheld you, he who after shot himself.    And whosoever looked on you, they say    That instant fell in love.     MARINA.                  Can't you be quicker?     ROUZYA. At once. Today your father counts upon you.    'Twas not for naught the young tsarevich saw you;    He could not hide his rapture; wounded he is    Already; so it only needs to deal him    A resolute blow, and instantly, my lady,    He'll be in love with you. 'Tis now a month    Since, quitting Cracow, heedless of the war    And throne of Moscow, he has feasted here,    Your guest, enraging Poles alike and Russians.    Heavens! Shall I ever live to see the day?--    Say, you will not, when to his capital    Dimitry leads the queen of Moscow, say    You'll not forsake me?     MARINA.              Dost thou truly think    I shall be queen?     ROUZYA.         Who, if not you? Who here    Dares to compare in beauty with my mistress?    The race of Mnishek never yet has yielded    To any. In intellect you are beyond    All praise.--Happy the suitor whom your glance    Honours with its regard, who wins your heart--    Whoe'er he be, be he our king, the dauphin    Of France, or even this our poor tsarevich    God knows who, God knows whence!     MARINA.                        The very son    Of the tsar, and so confessed by the whole world.     ROUZYA. And yet last winter he was but a servant    In the house of Vishnevetsky.     MARINA.                     He was hiding.     ROUZYA. I do not question it: but still do you know    What people say about him? That perhaps    He is a deacon run away from Moscow,    In his own district a notorious rogue.     MARINA. What nonsense!     ROUZYA.              O, I do not credit it!    I only say he ought to bless his fate    That you have so preferred him to the others.     WAITING-WOMAN. (Runs in.) The guests have come already.     MARINA.                           There you see;    You're ready to chatter silliness till daybreak.    Meanwhile I am not dressed--     ROUZYA.                   Within a moment    'Twill be quite ready.     (The Waiting-women bustle.)     MARINA. (Aside.)     I must find out all.     A SUITE OF LIGHTED ROOMS.  VISHNEVETSKY, MNISHEK     MNISHEK. With none but my Marina doth he speak,    With no one else consorteth--and that business    Looks dreadfully like marriage. Now confess,    Didst ever think my daughter would be a queen?     VISHNEVETSKY. 'Tis wonderful.--And, Mnishek, didst thou think    My servant would ascend the throne of Moscow?     MNISHEK. And what a girl, look you, is my Marina.    I merely "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],["title","Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#6)"],["body","to her: \"Now, be careful!    Let not Dimitry slip\"--and lo! Already    He is completely tangled in her toils.     (The band plays a Polonaise. The PRETENDER and    MARINA advance as the first couple.)     MARINA. (Sotto voce to Dimitry.) Tomorrow evening at eleven, beside    The fountain in the avenue of lime-trees.     (They walk off. A second couple.)     CAVALIER. What can Dimitry see in her?     DAME.                                How say you?    She is a beauty.     CAVALIER.      Yes, a marble nymph;    Eyes, lips, devoid of life, without a smile.     (A fresh couple.)     DAME. He is not handsome, but his eyes are pleasing,    And one can see he is of royal birth.     (A fresh couple.)     DAME. When will the army march?     CAVALIER.                     When the tsarevich    Orders it; we are ready; but 'tis clear    The lady Mnishek and Dimitry mean    To keep us prisoners here.     DAME.                    A pleasant durance.     CAVALIER. Truly, if you...     (They walk off; the rooms become empty.)     MNISHEK.          We old ones dance no longer;    The sound of music lures us not; we press not    Nor kiss the hands of charmers--ah! My friend,    I've not forgotten the old pranks! Things now    Are not what once they were, what once they were!    Youth, I'll be sworn, is not so bold, nor beauty    So lively; everything--confess, my friend--    Has somehow become dull. So let us leave them;    My comrade, let us go and find a flask    Of old Hungarian overgrown with mould;    Let's bid my butler open an old bottle,    And in a quiet corner, tete-a-tete,    Let's drain a draught, a stream as thick as fat;    And while we're so engaged, let's think things over.    Let us go, brother.     VISHNEVETSKY.     Yes, my friend, let's go.     NIGHT  THE GARDEN. THE FOUNTAIN     PRETENDER. (Enters.) Here is the fountain; hither will she come.    I was not born a coward; I have seen    Death near at hand, and face to face with death    My spirit hath not blenched. A life-long dungeon    Hath threatened me, I have been close pursued,    And yet my spirit quailed not, and by boldness    I have escaped captivity. But what    Is this which now constricts my breath? What means    This overpowering tremor, or this quivering    Of tense desire? No, this is fear. All day    I have waited for this secret meeting, pondered    On all that I should say to her, how best    I might enmesh Marina's haughty mind,    Calling her queen of Moscow. But the hour    Has come--and I remember naught, I cannot    Recall the speeches I have learned by rote;    Love puts imagination to confusion--    But something there gleamed suddenly--a rustling;    Hush--no, it was the moon's deceitful light,    It was the rustling of the breeze.     MARINA. (Enters.)                Tsarevich!     PRETENDER. 'Tis she. Now all the blood in me stands still.     MARINA. Dimitry! Is it thou?     PRETENDER.                 Bewitching voice!     (Goes to her.)     Is it thou, at last? Is it thou I see, alone    With me, beneath the roof of quiet night?    How slowly passed the tedious day! How slowly    The glow of evening died away! How long    I have waited in the gloom of night!     MARINA.                            The hours    Are flitting fast, and time is precious to me.    I did not grant a meeting here to thee    To listen to a lover's tender speeches.    No need of words. I well believe thou lovest;    But listen; with thy stormy, doubtful fate    I have resolved to join my own; but one thing,    Dimitry, I require; I claim that thou    Disclose to me thy secret hopes, thy plans,    Even thy fears, that hand in hand with thee    I may confront life boldly--not in blindness    Of childlike ignorance, not as the slave    And plaything of my husband's light desires,    Thy speechless concubine, but as thy spouse,    And worthy helpmate of the tsar of Moscow.     PRETENDER. O, if it be only for one short hour,    Forget the cares and troubles of my fate!    Forget 'tis the tsarevich whom thou seest    Before thee. O, behold in me, Marina,    A lover, by thee chosen, happy only    In thy regard. O, listen to the prayers    Of love! Grant me to utter all wherewith    My heart is full.     MARINA.         Prince, this is not the time;    Thou loiterest, and meanwhile the devotion    Of thine adherents cooleth. Hour by hour    Danger becomes more dangerous, difficulties    More difficult; already dubious rumours    Are current, novelty already takes    The place of novelty; and Godunov    Adopts his measures.     PRETENDER.         What is Godunov?    Is thy sweet love, my only blessedness,    Swayed by Boris? Nay, nay. Indifferently    I now regard his throne, his kingly power.    Thy love--without it what to me is life,    And glory's glitter, and the state of Russia?    On the dull steppe, in a poor mud hut, thou--    Thou wilt requite me for the kingly crown;    Thy love--     MARINA. For shame! Forget not, prince, thy high    And sacred destiny; thy dignity    Should be to thee more dear than all the joys    Of life and its allurements. It thou canst not    With anything compare. Not to a boy,    Insanely boiling, captured by my beauty--    But to the heir of Moscow's throne give I    My hand in solemn wise, to the tsarevich    Rescued by destiny.     PRETENDER.        Torture me not,    Charming Marina; say not that 'twas my rank    And not myself that thou didst choose. Marina!    Thou knowest not how sorely thou dost wound    My heart thereby. What if--O fearful doubt!--    Say, if blind destiny had not assigned me    A kingly birth; if I were not indeed    Son of Ivan, were not this boy, so long    Forgotten by the world--say, then wouldst thou    Have loved me?     MARINA.      Thou art Dimitry, and aught else    Thou canst not be; it is not possible    For me to love another.     PRETENDER.            Nay! Enough--    I have no wish to share with a dead body    A mistress who belongs to him; I have done    With counterfeiting, and will tell the truth.    Know, then, that thy Dimitry long ago    Perished, was buried--and will not rise again;    And dost thou wish to know what man I am?    Well, I will tell thee. I am--a poor monk.    Grown weary of monastic servitude,    I pondered 'neath the cowl my bold design,    Made ready for the world a miracle--    And from my cell at last fled to the Cossacks,    To their wild hovels; there I learned to handle    Both steeds and swords; I showed myself to you.    I called myself Dimitry, and deceived    The brainless Poles. What say'st thou, proud Marina?    Art thou content with my confession? Why    Dost thou keep silence?     MARINA.               O shame! O woe is me!     (Silence.)     PRETENDER. (Sotto voce.) O whither hath a fit of anger led me?    The happiness devised with so much labour    I have, perchance, destroyed for ever. Idiot,    What have I done? (Aloud.) I see thou art ashamed    Of love not princely; so pronounce on me    The fatal word; my fate is in thy hands.    Decide; I wait.     (Falls on his knees.)     MARINA.       Rise, poor pretender! Think'st thou    To please with genuflex on my vain heart,    As if I were a weak, confiding girl?    You err, my friend; prone at my feet I've seen    Knights and counts nobly born; but not for this    Did I reject their prayers, that a poor monk--     PRETENDER. (Rises.) Scorn not the young pretender; noble virtues    May lie perchance in him, virtues well worthy    Of Moscow's throne, even of thy priceless hand--     MARINA. Say of a shameful noose, insolent wretch!     PRETENDER. I am to blame; carried away by pride    I have deceived God and the kings--have lied    To the world; but it is not for thee, Marina,    To judge me; I am guiltless before thee.    No, I could not deceive thee. Thou to me    Wast the one sacred being, before thee    I dared not to dissemble; love alone,    Love, jealous, blind, constrained me to tell all.     MARINA. What's that to boast of, idiot? Who demanded    Confession of thee? If thou, a nameless vagrant    Couldst wonderfully blind two nations, then    At least thou shouldst have merited success,    And thy bold fraud secured, by constant, deep,    And lasting secrecy. Say, can I yield    Myself to thee, can I, forgetting rank    And maiden modesty, unite my fate    With thine, when thou thyself impetuously    Dost thus with such simplicity reveal    Thy shame? It was from Love he blabbed to me!    I marvel wherefore thou hast not from friendship    Disclosed thyself ere now before my father,    Or else before our king from joy, or else    Before Prince Vishnevetsky from the zeal    Of a devoted servant.     PRETENDER.          I swear to thee    That thou alone wast able to extort    My heart's confession; I swear to thee that never,    Nowhere, not in the feast, not in the cup    Of folly, not in friendly confidence,    Not 'neath the knife nor tortures of the rack,    Shall my tongue give away these weighty secrets.     MARINA. Thou swearest! Then I must believe. Believe,    Of course! But may I learn by what thou swearest?    Is it not by the name of God, as suits    The Jesuits' devout adopted son?    Or by thy honour as a high-born knight?    Or, maybe, by thy royal word alone    As a king's son? Is it not so? Declare.     PRETENDER. (Proudly.) The phantom of the Terrible hath made me    His son; from out the sepulchre hath named me    Dimitry, hath stirred up the people round me,    And hath consigned Boris to be my victim.    I am tsarevich. Enough! 'Twere shame for me    To stoop before a haughty Polish dame.    Farewell for ever; the game of bloody war,    The wide cares of my destiny, will smother,    I hope, the pangs Of love. O, when the heat    Of shameful passion is o'erspent, how then    Shall I detest thee! Now I leave thee--ruin,    Or else a crown, awaits my head in Russia;    Whether I meet with death as fits a soldier    In honourable fight, or as a miscreant    Upon the "]]]
