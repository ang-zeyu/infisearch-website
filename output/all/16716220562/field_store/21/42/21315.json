You have had enough _sharig_ antidote to cure a _tharl_. Now. Who are you?\"  The words were meaningless. I stared, trapped. I clung to hold on to identity. \"Adric--\" I said, bewildered. That was my name. Was it? Wasn't it? No. I was Mike Kenscott. Hang on to that. Two and two are four. The circumference equals the radius squared times pi. Four rulls is the chemming of twilp--_stop that!_ Mike Kenscott. Summer 1954. Army serial number 13-48746. Karamy. I cradled my bursting head in my hands. \"I'm crazy. Or you are. Or we're both sane and this monkey-business is all real.\"  \"It is real,\" said Rhys, compassion in his tired face. \"He has been very far on the Time Ellipse, Gamine. Adric, try to understand. This was Karamy's work. She sent you out on a time line, far, very far into the past. Into a time when the Earth was different--she hoped you would come back changed, or mad.\" His eyes brooded. \"I think she succeeded. Gamine, I have long outstayed my leave. I must return to my own tower--or die. Will you explain?\"  \"I will.\" A hint of emotion flickered in the voice of Gamine. \"Go, Master.\"  Rhys left the room, through one of the doors. Gamine turned impatiently to me again. \"We waste time this way. Fool, look at yourself!\"  I strode to a mirror that lined one of the doors. Above the crimson nightshirt I saw a face--not my own. The sight rocked my mind. Out of the mirror a man's face looked anxiously; a face eagle-thin, darkly moustached, with sharp green eyes. The body belonging to the face that was _not_ mine was lean and long and strongly muscled--and not quite human. I squeezed my eyes shut. This couldn't be--I opened my eyes. The man in the red nightshirt I was wearing was still reflected there.  I turned my back on the mirror, walking to one of the barred windows to look down on the familiar outline of the Sierra Madre, about a hundred miles away. I couldn't have been mistaken. I knew that ridge of mountains. But between me and the mountains lay a thickly forested expanse of land which looked like no scenery I had ever seen in my life. I was standing near the pinnacle of a high tower; I dimly saw the curve of another, just out of my line of vision. The whole landscape was bathed in a curiously pinkish light; through an overcast sky I could just make out, dimly, the shadowy disk of a watery red sun. Then--no, I wasn't dreaming, I really did see it--beyond it, a second sun; blue-white, shining brilliantly, pallid through the clouds, but brighter than any sunlight I had ever seen.  It was proof enough for me. I turned desperately to Gamine behind me. \"Where have I gotten, to? Where--_when_ am I? Two suns--those mountains--\"  The change in Gamine's voice was swift; the veiled face lifted questioningly to mine. What I had thought a veil was not that; it seemed to be more like a shimmering screen wrapped around the features so that Gamine was faceless, an invisible person with substance but no apprehensible characteristics. Yes, it was like that; as if there was an invisible person wearing the curious silken draperies. But the invisible flesh was solid enough. Hands like cold steel gripped my shoulders. \"You have been back? Back to the days before the second sun? Adric, tell me; did Earth truly have but one sun?\"  \"Wait--\" I begged. \"You mean I've travelled in time?\"  The exultation faded from Gamine's voice imperceptibly. \"Never mind. It is improbable in any case. No, Adric; not really travelling. You were only sent out on the Time Ellipse, till you contacted some one in that other Time. Perhaps you stayed in contact with his mind so long that you think you are he?\"  \"I'm not Adric--\" I raged. \"Adric sent me here--\"  I saw the blurring around Gamine's invisible features twitch in a headshake. \"It's never been proven that two minds can be interchanged like that. Adric's body. Adric's brain. The brain convolutions, the memory centers, the habit patterns--you'd still be Adric. The idea that you are someone else is only an illusion of your conscious mind. It will wear off.\"  I shook my head, puzzled. \"I still don't believe it. Where am I?\"  Gamine moved impatiently. \"Oh, very well. You are Adric of Narabedla; and if you are sane again, Lord of the Crimson Tower. I am Gamine.\" The swathed shoulders moved a little. \"You don't remember? I am a spell-singer.\"  I jerked my elbow toward the window. \"Those are my own mountains out there,\" I said roughly. \"I'm not Adric, whoever he is. My name's Mike Kenscott, and your hanky-panky doesn't impress me. Take off that veil and let me see your face.\"  \"I wish you meant that--\" a mournfulness breathed in the soft contralto. A sudden fury blazed up in me from nowhere. \"And what right have you to pry for that old fool Rhys? Get back to your own place, then, spell-singer--\" I broke off, appalled. What was I saying? Worse, what did I mean by it? Gamine turned. The sexless voice was coldly amused. \"Adric spoke then. Whoever sits in the seat of your soul, you are the same--and past redemption!\" The robes whispered sibilantly on the floor as Gamine moved to the door. \"Karamy is welcome to her slave!\"  The door slammed.  Left alone, I flung myself down on the high bed, stubbornly concentrating on Mike Kenscott, shutting out the vague blurred mystery in my mind that was Adric impinging on consciousness. I was not Adric. I would _not_ be. I dared not go to the window and look out at the terrifying two suns, even to see the reassurance of the familiar Sierra Madre skyline. A homesick terror was hurting in me.  But persistently the Adric memories came, a guilty feeling of a shirked duty, and a frightened face--a real face, not a blurred nothingness--beneath Gamine's blue veils. Memories of strange hunts and a big bird on the pommel of a high saddle. A bird hooded like a falcon, in crimson.  Consciousness of dress made me remember the--nightshirt--I still wore. Moving swiftly, without conscious thought, I went to a door and slid it open; pulled out some garments and dressed in them. Every garment in the closet was the same color; deep-hued crimson. I glanced in the mirror and a phrase Gamine had used broke the surface of my mind like a leaping fish. \"Lord of the Crimson Tower.\" Well, I looked it. There had been knives and swords in the closet; I took out one to look at it, and before I realized what I was doing I had belted it across my hip. I stared, decided to let it remain. It looked all right with the rest of the costume. It felt right, too. Another door folded back noiselessly and a man stood looking at me.  He was young and would have been handsome in an effeminate way if his face had not been so arrogant. Lean, somehow catlike, it was easy to determine that he was akin to Adric, or me, even before the automatic habit of memory fitted name and identity to him. \"Evarin,\" I said, warily.  He came forward, moving so softly that for an uneasy moment I wondered if he had pads like a cat's on his feet. He wore deep green from head to foot, similar to the crimson garments that clothed me. His face had a flickering, as if he could at a moment's notice raise a barrier of invisibility like Gamine's about himself. He didn't look as human as I.  \"I have seen Gamine,\" he said. \"She says you are awake, and as sane as you ever were. We of Narabedla are not so strong that we can afford to waste even a broken tool like you.\"  Wrath--Adric's wrath--boiled up in me; but Evarin moved lithely backward. \"I am not Gamine,\" he warned. \"And I will not be served like Gamine has been served. Take care.\"  \"Take care yourself,\" I muttered, knowing little else I could have said. Evarin drew back thin lips. \"Why? You have been sent out on the Time Ellipse till you are only a shadow of yourself. But all this is beside the point. Karamy says you are to be freed, so the seals are off all the doors, and the Crimson Tower is no longer a prison to you. Come and go as you please. Karamy--\" his lips formed a sneer. \"If you call _that_ freedom!\"  I said slowly, \"You think I'm not crazy?\"  Evarin snorted. \"Except where Karamy is concerned, you never were. What is that to me? I have everything I need. The Dreamer gives me good hunting and slaves enough to do my bidding. For the rest, I am the Toymaker. I need little. But you--\" his voice leaped with contempt, \"you ride time at Karamy's bidding--and your Dreamer walks--waiting the coming of his power that he may destroy us all one day!\"  I stared somberly at Evarin, standing still near the door. The words seemed to wake an almost personal shame in me. The boy watched and his face lost some of his bitterness. He said more quietly, \"The falcon flown cannot be recalled. I came only to tell you that you are free.\" He turned, shrugging his thin shoulders, and walked to the window. \"As I say, if you call that freedom.\"  I followed him to the window. The clouds were clearing; the two suns shone with a blinding brilliance. By looking far to the left I could see a line of rainbow-tinted towers that rose into the sky, tall and capped with slender spires. I could distinguish five clearly; one, the nearest, seemed made of a jewelled blue; one, clear emerald green; golden, flame-colored, violet. There were more beyond, but the colors were blurred and dim. They made a semicircle about a wooded park; beyond them the familiar skyline of the mountains tugged old memories in my brain. The suns swung high in a sky that held no tint of blue, that was as clear and colorless as ice. Abruptly I turned my back on it all. Evarin murmured, \"Narabedla. Last of the Rainbow Cities. Adric--how long now?\"  I did not answer. \"Karamy wants me?\"  Evarin's laugh was only a soundless shaking of his thin shoulders. \"Karamy can wait. Better for you if she waited forever. Come along with me, or Gamine will be back. You don't want to see Gamine, do you?\" He sounded anxious; I shook my head. Emphatically, I did"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50566"],["title","Falcons of Narabedla (#3)"],["body","want to see that insidious spook again. \"No. Why? Should I?\"  Evarin looked relieved. \"Come along, then. If I know Gamine, you're pretty well muddled. Amnesiac. I'll explain. After all--\" his voice mocked, \"you _are_ my brother!\"  He thrust open the door and motioned me through. Instinctively I drew back, gesturing him to lead the way; he laughed soundlessly and went, and I followed, letting it slide shut behind me.  We went down stairs and more stairs. I walked at Evarin's side, one part of me wondering why I was not more panicky. I was a stranger in a world gone insane, yet I had that outrageous calmness with which men do fantastic things in a dream. I was simply taking one step after another; knowing what to do with that part of me that was Adric. Gamine had spoken of habit patterns, the convolutions of the brain. I had Adric's body. Only a superficial me, an outer ego, was still a strange, muddled Mike Kenscott. The subconscious Adric was guiding me. I let him ride. I felt it would be wise to be very much Adric around Evarin. We stepped into an elevator shaft which went down, curved around corners with a speed that threw me against the wall, then began, slowly, to rise. I had long since lost all sense of direction. Abruptly the door of the shaft opened and we began to walk along a long, brilliantly illuminated passage. From somewhere we heard singing; a voice somewhere in the range of a trained boy's voice or a woman's mature contralto. Gamine's voice. I could make no sense of the words; but Evarin halted to listen, swearing in a whisper. I thought the faraway voice sang my name and Evarin's, but I could not tell. \"What is it, Evarin?\"  He gave a short exclamation, the sense of which was lost on me.  \"Come along,\" he said irritably, \"It is only the spell-singer, singing old Rhys back to sleep. You waked him this time, did you not? I wonder Gamine permitted it. He is very near his last sleep--old Rhys. I think you will send him there soon.\" Without giving me a chance to answer--and for that matter, I had no answer ready--he pulled me aside between recessed walls and again the shaft in which we stood began to ride. Eventually we stepped into a room at the top of another tower, a room lavishly, even garishly furnished. Evarin flung himself carelessly on a divan embroidered in silken purple and gestured me to follow his example. \"Well, now tell me. Where in Time has Karamy sent you now?\"  \"Karamy?\" I asked tentatively. Evarin's raucous laugh rang out again. He said with seeming irrelevance, but with an odd air of confiding, \"My one demand of the Dreamer is--freedom from that witch's spells. Some day I shall fashion a Toy for her. I am not the Toymaker of Narabedla for nothing. I demand little enough of the Dreamers, Zandru knows! I do not like to pay their price, but Karamy does not care what she pays. So--\" he made a spreading movement of his hands, \"she has power over everyone, except me. Yes; assuredly I must make her a Toy. She sent you out on the Time Ellipse. I wonder who brought you back?\"  I shook my head. \"I've been out of my body too long. I can't remember much.\"  \"You remember me,\" Evarin said. \"I wonder why she left you that? Karamy's amnesia-rays took the rest of your memory. She never trusted me that far before.\"  But I caught the crafty look in his face. I knew only this about Evarin; Karamy was right not to trust him. I said, \"I only remember your name. Nothing more.\"  Because Evarin--I knew--was never ten minutes the same. He would profess friendship and mean friendship; ten minutes later, still in friendship, he would flay the skin from my body and count it only an exquisite joke. I did not like those perverted and subtle eyes. He seemed to read my thought. \"Good, we will be strangers. Brothers are too--\" he let the word trail off, unfinished. \"What have you forgotten?\"  Could I trust him with my terrible puzzlement? How much could I, as Adric--and I _must_ be Adric to him--get along without knowing? What was even more to the point, how many questions could I dare ask without betraying my own helplessness? I compromised. \"What are the Dreamers?\"  That _had_ been the wrong question.  \"Zandru. Adric, you have been far indeed! You must have been back before the Cataclysm! Well--our forefathers, after the Cataclysm, ruled this planet and built the Rainbow Cities. That was before the Compact that killed machines. Some people say the Dreamers were born from the dead machines.\"  He began to pace the floor restlessly. \"They were men--once,\" he said. \"They are born from men and women. Mendel knows what caused them. But one in every ten million men is such a freak--a Dreamer. Some say they came out of the Cataclysm; some say they are the souls of the dead Machines. They are human--and not human. They were telepaths. They could control everything--things, minds, people. They could throw illusions around things and men--they contested our rules.\"  He sat down; his voice became brooding, quiet. \"One of us, here in Rainbow City, a dozen generations ago, found a way to bind the Dreamers,\" he said. \"We could not kill them; they were deathless, normally. But we could bind them in sleep. As they slept, under a forced stasis, we could make them give up their powers--to us. So that we controlled the things _they_ controlled. For a price.\" There was a glimpse of horror behind his eyes. \"You know the price. It is high.\"  I kept silent. I wanted Evarin to go on.  He shivered a little, shook his head and the horror vanished. \"So each of us has a Dreamer of his own who can grant him power to do as he wills. And after years and years, as the Dreamers grow old, they grow mortal. They can be killed. And fewer are born, now; fewer to each generation. As they grow older and weaker, it is safe to let them wake; but never too strongly, or too long.\" He laughed, bitterly. A fury came from nowhere into his face.  \"And you loosed a Dreamer!\" he cried. \"A Dreamer with all his power hardly come upon him! He is harmless as yet--but he wakes, and he walks! And one day the power will come upon him--and he will destroy us all!\" Evarin's thin features were drawn with despair; not arrogant, now, but full of suffering. \"A Dreamer--\", he sighed. \"A Dreamer, and you had been made one with him already! Can you see now why we do not trust you--brother?\"  Without answering I rose and went to the window. This window did not look on the neat little park, but on a vast tract of wild country. Far away, curious trails of smoke spiralled up into the sunlight and a wispy fog lay in the bottomlands.  \"Down there,\" said Evarin in a low voice, \"Down there the Dreamer walks and waits! Down there--\"  But I did not hear the rest, for my mind completed it. Down there--  Down there is my lost memory. Down there was my life.  Somewhere down there I had left my soul.     CHAPTER THREE  Flowers of Danger   I turned my back on the window. \"Rhys is a Dreamer,\" I said with slow certainty. \"What is Gamine?\"  Evarin nodded slowly, ignoring the question. \"Rhys is a Dreamer, yes. He is old--so old he is almost mortal now; so he wakes, and he too walks. But he was one of us once--the only Dreamer ever born within the Rainbow City. His loyalty is double; but he will never harm Narabedla, because he is of our blood.\" Evarin cleared his throat. \"So Gamine takes what knowledge can be had from his old, old mind. And does not pay.\"  \"Who is Gamine?\" I asked again. Evarin still hesitated.  \"Karamy hates Gamine,\" he said, after minutes. \"So no man sees Gamine's face. I would not ask too many questions--unless you ask them of Karamy.\" A smile flickered on the mobile features. \"Ask Karamy,\" he said gleefully, \"She will tell!\"  \"She will?\" I said stupidly, because I could think of nothing else to say. Evarin's grin was delicately malicious. \"Oh, I am sure of that! Karamy is quick to strike. Gamine and I have little love lost, but we agree on one thing; that Karamy's procession of slaves is monstrous. And that you are a fool to help Karamy pay for her--desires. Karamy is far too fond of power in her own hands, to pay to put it into yours.\"  Karamy. Karamy who took my memory--  \"She did.\" Evarin murmured, and I realized I had spoken aloud. The room seemed full of a weighty silence. Evarin's prowling footsteps made no noise as he came to my side. \"I can give it back to you, though. I have made you a Toy.\" His effete voice rather disgusted me, and I moved away, but he followed. \"Look here, and find your memory.\"  And he put something small and hard into my hand; something wrapped in silvery silks.  I raised my hand curiously, untwisting the wrappings. They were smooth and shining and colorless, with a bluish cast, like Gamine's veils; no fabric I had ever seen. Evarin backed slowly away from me. For an instant all I could see was a blurred invisibility--like Gamine's face behind the veils--then a sort of mirror became slowly visible. It did not seem to reflect anything; rather, it was a coldly shining surface, cloudy, glittering from within. I bent to examine the pattern of the shadows that moved on the surface. There was a curious pull from the mirror, a cold that crept sluggishly from my hand. A familiar, soothing cold. As if drawn by a magnet, my eyes bent closer--  Recognition crashed in my mind. Evarin--and his gilt deadly Toys.... I dashed the colorless thing to the floor, giving it a savage kick. The blurred invisibility wavered; I caught a glimpse of a tiny jewelled mechanism, before it sprang back to gray ice again. Evarin had backed halfway across the room; I leaped at him, collaring the dandy and wrenching him close. \"I've a good mind to tie the thing across your throat!\" I grated.  Evarin's lip twisted up. Suddenly his whole face melted in a blurring invisibility and I felt his whole substance evaporate from between my hands. He writhed like smoke, and I leaped backward just as he materialized, whole and deadly, too close. \"I am always--guarded!\" he jerked out"]]]
