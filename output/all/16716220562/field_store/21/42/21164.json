A dyed pattern may be produced in several ways:  1. The dye is applied to the desired parts of the fabric and means taken to set it there without it spreading to other parts. This is known as direct coloring. Block printing and stenciling, as ordinarily done, are examples. Calico printing is an industrial application of the method.  2. A resist of some kind is applied to parts of the fabric to prevent their taking the dye, after which the fabric is treated in a dye-bath. Batik decoration and tie-dyed work both fall in this class. Stencils and print blocks may also be used in the application of the resist.  3. A \"discharge\" is put on parts of previously dyed goods, which either removes the color where it touches, or else alters the shade. Different discharges are used according to the nature of the dye and the goods. Some chemicals used as discharges are liable, unless skillfully handled, to attack and tender the cloth. The method belongs rather to the industrial world where abundant apparatus and trained dyeing chemists are available. It is not, however, beyond the skill of a good craftsman who has acquired some experience with dyes.  The dye for direct coloring is applied in liquid form, sometimes thickened into a paste by use of gums, starch, etc. Often mordants or other assisting chemicals are incorporated into the mixture. In block printing this color mixture is brushed on the block, which is then imprinted on the fabric in the desired place, and the color driven into the fiber with pressure or a sharp blow. Stenciling is done by brushing the color mixture through the open parts of the stencil, or by blown stenciling in which a volatile color mixture is sprayed with an atomizer.  The best method of setting the dyes in this direct coloring is that pursued commercially in calico printing, treatment with dry steam, _i.e._, steam applied at a temperature sufficiently high to prevent its condensation into drops of hot water on the fabric, which would be quite ruinous to the design. This is done successfully by Oriental craftsmen, and it would be very desirable to have suitable apparatus in American schools and studios.  Next best, though considerably less efficient, is the commonly practiced method of laying the fabric between dampened cloths and pressing with a hot iron until dry.  The resist method has an advantage in that it allows the use of a dye-bath. The limitation of temperatures that may be used places some restriction on the choice of dyes. Batik dyeing must be done without melting the wax resist. But after eliminating those dyes which require high temperatures and also those not suitable for pattern dyeing, there still remains a good range of colors. Batik is without doubt the most versatile of all methods of pattern dyeing.  Tie-dyed work depends upon tightly wound string or yarn to resist the dye. It also has the advantage of the dye-bath. Though less versatile than batik, it has a time-honored place as a method of beautiful and charming results. The introduction of sticks over which the tying is done, such sticks as are used by the children in stick printing, has opened new problems with added variety and much interest.   DYES  The colors available for craft work are commonly grouped into the following classes, which will be briefly described:  _Direct Colors._ These are so called because they are applied to all fibers directly without the use of mordants. They are principally used for dyeing cotton. Some dyes of this class have affinity for both cotton and wool. Most of the package dyes sold at the local stores are of this class. They are applied to cotton in a boiling bath and to wool at high temperature near the boiling point. Different assistants are used varying with the dye and the nature of the fabric.  The direct colors, being very soluble, are prone to \"bleed\" when the goods are washed, but owing to this same fact it is easy to produce level dyeing on the goods. On this same account, however, and also on account of the high temperature required, they are not well suited for pattern dyeing.  _Acid Colors._ These have great commercial value for dyeing wool and sometimes silk. The best of them are quite fast to light but not to washing. They are not suitable for cotton or linen.  _Basic Colors._ These will dye wool and silk directly and also raffia, straw, basketry material, leather and wood. They dye cotton when mordanted with tannic acid, and this constitutes a very large commercial use. Basic dyes are especially strong in coloring power. Many of them are fugitive to light. A few of the best of them, however, when properly applied, are fast to washing and fairly fast to light.  _Sulphur Colors._ These are used extensively on cotton, giving colors fast to washing and to light. The dyeing is done at high temperature in a strongly alkaline bath of sodium sulphide along with other assistants. The colors are all dull and the range of colors is not complete, there being a lack of reds. These dyes are not suitable for silks.  _Vat Colors_ are so called because the method of dyeing is that of the indigo vat. Indigo has been known for a long time, but only in recent years have other dyes of this class been produced, until now the series includes the entire range of colors. As a class they are the fastest colors ever known. The best of them are so fast that the cloth will wear out without the color changing. They are used chiefly on cotton and linen, sometimes on silk.  Vat dyes have been very expensive and scarcely obtainable during the war. Their future is of great interest and importance both in the industries and to craft workers.  In addition to the dyes above mentioned there are many others the use of which is quite complicated and technical and therefore confined to the industries.  For a fuller discussion of dyes and their uses the reader is referred to Pellew's \"Dyes and Dyeing\" (Robert McBride & Co., New York). This is a most excellent book written for craftsmen. Like most of our literature, the treatment of dyes is based upon pre-war conditions, when nearly all of our colors were imported. The latest edition, however, contains an added chapter dealing with the present transitional state, incident to the transfer of the industry to this side of the water and the development of great American color houses.  It may be added that the leading firms carrying school art supplies offer dyes in suitable form especially adapted for the problems in pattern dyeing.  Perhaps a few suggestions to the less experienced of our readers will prove helpful. All of the good dyes manufactured today are in a very pure form. The use of one dye alone often gives results that are crude without any subtle beauty. It is frequently necessary to apply the principle well known to all workers in color, that colors are softened and beautified by small admixtures of their compliments; that one color that is cold, or another that is hot, becomes warmed or toned by a suitable admixture of other colors.  It may be stated that most of the beautiful dyeing is built up from two or more colors. This is accomplished, according to the nature of the dyes and the fabric, by mixing the colors in the same dye-bath, or by dyeing the cloth successively in different colors. Of course the previous condition of the fabric must be taken into account. A bleached cotton cloth must be treated differently from a grayed one if an equally soft effect is desired.  In the old days dyes contained impurities which often caused beautiful grayed effects. But it is inexcusable today for anyone with knowledge of the above principle and with elementary knowledge of dyes and dye-baths not to get equally good results.  The inartistic work that we see so prevalent today in the realm of dyed fabrics is due in part to ignorance and lack of appreciation of good color and in part to the commercial race for profit. As the taste of the people makes demand for better things the response of industry will not be wanting.  Nor need the craftsman of today spend idle time mourning the disappearance of vegetable colors and his necessity for using coal tar dyes. We must remember that only the best of the vegetable dyeing has come down to us. The proportion of poor work with vegetable dyes has always been as large or even larger than with the present-day colors. We are too prone to compare the ordinary home dyeing of today or the cheaper commercial dyeing with the good pieces that have been preserved from the past. When in justice the comparison is made of the best with the best, the coal tar dyes not only do not suffer but they really gain.  The coal tar dyes are like the vegetable dyes in the sense of being organic. In many instances they are identical chemically with corresponding dyes formerly obtained from vegetables. The one difference, as we have indicated, is their purity. Just as our granules of sugar have displaced the sweetening of former days; just as our modern medicines have succeeded the herb-teas of our grandparents, so also have come our dyes. All are achievements of science.  Coal tar dyes have come to stay, vegetable dyes for the most part have gone and will not return, and there is no sadness in the word. It is rather for us to rise to the challenge that has come, to recognize our greater heritage, and by pains, patience and intelligence in our work to ply the art worthily.   COLOR MIXING  The following general principles of color mixing apply to dyeing, both when colors are mixed in a dye-bath and when they are dyed one color over another:  Red is grayed by small amounts of yellow and blue or by any color containing both of these, as green, brown or gray.  Yellow is grayed by small amounts of red and blue or by any color containing both of these, as purple, brown or gray.  Blue is grayed by small amounts of red and yellow, or by any color containing both of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49823"],["title","Batik and Other Pattern Dyeing (#4)"],["body","se, as orange, brown or gray.  Red plus yellow gives orange or yellowish red or reddish yellow. These are grayed by a small amount of blue or any color containing blue, as green, purple, brown or gray.  Red plus blue gives purple or reddish blue or bluish red. These are grayed by a small amount of yellow or any color containing yellow, as orange, green, brown or gray.  Blue plus yellow gives green or bluish yellow (usually called greenish yellow) or yellowish blue (usually called greenish blue). These are grayed by a small amount of red or any color containing red, as orange, purple, brown or gray.  Red plus yellow plus blue give--  (1) One of the above if any one or two of the three is present in the small proportion necessary for graying purposes.  (2) Gray if all three are present in such proportion as to neutralize each other. If this is perfectly accomplished we have a neutral gray, otherwise a red gray, yellow gray, blue gray, purple gray, etc. Gray intensified becomes black, and there are modified blacks, as blue black, green black, etc. In making up a gray or black, beginners usually err in taking too large a proportion of yellow, and perhaps also of red.  (3) Brown if the three are present within certain other ranges of proportion. Browns may be classified as yellow browns, red browns, blue browns, green browns, purple browns, etc.  There are all gradations between neutral gray and the browns; between the browns and the secondary colors, orange, green and purple; between the secondary colors and the primary colors, red, yellow and blue.  In the practical handling of dyes, in order to get the entire range of colors from the primary colors, it is necessary that the red, yellow and blue dyes chosen be pure and luminous in color quality. Fortunately, there are such dyes.  There are, however, other valuable dyes that do not have this purity of color. For example, there are yellows containing considerable red or brown, reds containing yellow or blue, blues containing red, etc. Then there are dyes that are green, brown, purple and black. All of these have limitations when used in compounding colors. Neither a yellow inclined to the brown, nor a red containing blue, can be used to form a luminous orange. Likewise the compounding of a vivid blue green, or reseda green, forbids either the yellow or the blue containing any appreciable admixture of red.  All of these dyes find great use in the industries, and all of them, within their limitations, are valuable for color mixing. Having acquired a working knowledge of red, yellow and blue dyes, it will be found of practical benefit to include some of the others. An experienced craftsman works with a small range of colors chosen for his particular purpose.  Dyes differ in coloring power, even different specimens of the same dye, so that it is not possible to give quantitative formulas for certain colors bearing popular names. It will be helpful to discuss a few of them.  Olive green may be made by adding to blue-green either red or preferably yellow brown. This addition should be made a little at a time with frequent tests, a suggestion applicable to all color mixing.  Tan is obtained by mixing yellow and yellow brown. An added tinge of blue or green gives pongee.  Gold contains much yellow with certain smaller amounts of red and blue. But it might be difficult to control the addition of these colors, so it is better to start with much yellow and add a little at a time orange and blue green.  For burnt orange add yellow brown to orange.  For turquoise add to blue a little yellow, or preferably blue green.  For old rose add to dilute red a tinge of blue or preferably purple.  Taupe is a gray thrown off, usually with purple, but sometimes with red or yellow or blue.  Salmon is formed by adding to yellow some orange and a tinge of brown.  Any dyeing over old color must be considered as a mixing of the new color with the old, which manner of thinking will help in choosing the dye necessary for a desired effect. For example, a green cloth is to be dyed black. There should be two dyeings, the first a red to neutralize the green, the second a black to intensify the neutrality. Likewise a red cloth becomes black by dyeing first green and then black.  Over a light yellow purple may be dyed, the result will be a grayed purple. Over a strong yellow much purple will be required and the result will be a very much grayed purple approaching if not becoming a purple black.  In batik decoration by successive dyeings the craftsman is constantly mixing the new dye with that already in the fiber. Having once introduced an intensity of any primary color, yellow, red or blue, he must thereafter, unless he removes this color, complete his pattern by producing secondary and tertiary colors.    [Illustration: {BATIK DESIGN} {p. 53}]     CHAPTER III  WAX RESIST PROCESSES   The most commonly used fabrics for batiks are thin silks, white or light in color. Wax penetrates the sheer materials better. They take the color more evenly, and retain their brilliant texture. Heavy materials must be waxed on both sides to insure perfect stopping out of color.    [Illustration: {PAINTING A DESIGN} {p. 54}]  The design is more easily applied to thin goods, as the decoration is readily traced. On heavy fabrics the design is either drawn free hand or pounced. When the outline is drawn in wax the drawing does not disappear in the dyeing. When only parts of the design are painted in with wax the outline must be redrawn after each dyeing. For this purpose pouncing is best.  Velvets should be stopped out on the wrong side. Steaming will raise the pile again, or it may be sent to the dry cleaner.    [Illustration: A BATIK FRAME {p. 55}]    [Illustration: AN OUTLINE DRAWING IN WAX {p. 55}]  Wood is a good medium to take wax resist. The wax is removed by scraping. The surface is cleaned with gasoline and finished in any approved manner. Toys, frames, trays, basket bottoms, boxes, etc., are very pleasing when decorated in this manner.    [Illustration: COLOR PAINTED WITHIN WAX OUTLINES {p. 56}]  Leather and paper are dampened and pasted smoothly on glass. They are then decorated like wood.  Chiffons and crepes may be waxed double, or even folded four times.    [Illustration: THE COMPLETED PATTERN {p. 57}]  In applying a design, care should be taken to keep the fabric straight. Drawing a thread from the fabric makes a good guide.  When working upon woven materials it is best to use a frame placed horizontally upon a table. A frame suitable for this work should be light to handle and strong. It should be high enough above the table to keep the wax or dye from touching it. When the wax touches an obstacle before it is cold it sticks. The wax is apt to break when pulled away from the object. Color penetrates by accident and the result is disappointing. Some artists work on a table upon which smooth or glazed paper is spread. Here again the wax may also suffer. When dyes are painted on the fabric, if they touch the table or other objects they spread and mar the definite outline of the design.  A frame, around the inside edge of which are cloth strips for pinning or sewing the fabric securely, is an excellent aid to good workmanship. Adjustable holes with corners secured by screws and wing nuts make it possible to roll long pieces of cloth at the top and bottom of the frame. Or by means of these holes the strips may be spliced together to form a still larger frame.  Paper should be rolled with the cloth to prevent the wax sticking. Handled in this manner only a small part of the work needs to be exposed, and the work can be done on a small table or school desk.  Another advantage of such a frame is the ease with which the piece is laid aside without injury during the intervals of work. This is especially valuable where class problems are being conducted. It also permits of the work being done in any position--horizontal, inclined or upright.  When dyeing the material more than once the wax must be carefully mended after each dyeing, or soon the first spaces covered with the resist are lost or badly obscured. The material should always be dry before applying the wax.    [Illustration: COLORS PAINTED WITHOUT WAX OUTLINES {p. 59}]  Some workers use pure beeswax. It does not break easily when worked in a warm dye-bath. It melts at a high temperature. Resin mixed with beeswax melts at a still higher temperature. There are special batik waxes that have all the desired qualities of toughness and resistance. These mixed waxes are similar to those used by industrial works in Java. Paraffin and beeswax are also used.  The best container for molten wax is a double boiler, the common kitchen utensil, as it is possible to keep the wax hot through a class period without having the heater in the class room. As means of heating, an electric toaster, gas plate, canned heat, etc., are suggested.  The wax must be applied hot. The brush, while waxing, should be kept hot to insure good penetration of the wax. To accomplish this, each time the brush is dipped into the molten wax it should be held there sufficiently long to remelt any wax that may have congealed in or on the brush.  To apply the wax, some use a tjanting. Others prefer the simpler method of a good sable or camel's hair brush. The brush gives a broader and more varied treatment. A broad brush is best for covering large surfaces. Brushes used for painting in oils or water colors are used for painting in wax and dyes.  Those who are interested further in the possibilities of the tjanting are referred to Pieter Mijer's excellent treatment of this subject.  Dyes suitable for pattern dyeing should not run or \"bleed.\" Some use only primary colors. Others desire a more extended range. A good selection may include red, yellow, blue, orange, green, purple, brown and black.    [Illustration: PART OF A DESIGN STOPPED OUT WITH WAX, READY FOR THE       FIRST DYEING {p. 61}]  The"]]]
