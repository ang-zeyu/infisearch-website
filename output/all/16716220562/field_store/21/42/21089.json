It pays six dollars and your lunch while you're here. Or you could give blood, but the law restricts you to once every three months on that, and it only pays thirty-five dollars. Or--\"  Jeff shook his head and leaned forward. He looked directly into her eyes. \"I don't think you understand,\" he said softly. \"I want money. Lots of it. Not five or ten dollars.\" He looked down at the desk. \"I've heard you have other kinds of work.\"  The woman's eyes narrowed. \"There are higher-paying categories of Volunteer work, of course. But you must understand that they are higher paying because they involve a greater risk to the health of the Volunteer. For instance, we've been running circulation studies with heart catheterizations. We pay a hundred dollars for these, but there is an appreciable risk involved. Or sternal marrow punctures for blood studies. Usually we start--\"  \"I said money,\" said Jeff implacably. \"Not peanuts.\"  Her eyes widened and she stared at him for a long moment. It was a strange, penetrating stare that took him in from his face to his feet. Her smile faded and her fingers were suddenly nervous. \"Have you any idea what you're talking about?\"  \"I have. I'm talking about the Mercy Men.\"  She stood up abruptly and disappeared into an inner office. Jeff waited, his whole body trembling. Beads of sweat broke out on his forehead, and he gave a visible start when the woman opened the door again.  \"Come in here, please.\"  Then he was on the right track. He tried to conceal the excitement in his eyes as he took a seat in the small room. He waited, fidgeting. The woman packed up a small telephone on the desk and punched several buttons in rapid succession. The silence was almost intolerable as he waited, a silence that was alive and vibrant. Finally a signal light flickered and she took up the receiver.  \"Dr. Schiml? This is the Volunteer office, Doctor.\" She shot Jeff a swift glance. \"There's another man here to see you.\"  Meyer felt his heart pound. He shifted in his chair and started to take out a cigarette. Then he checked himself.  \"That's right,\" the woman was saying, eyeing him as if he were a biological specimen. \"I'm sorry, he hasn't given a name.... Ten minutes? All right, Doctor, I'll have him wait.\" With that, she replaced the receiver and left the room without a word.  Jeff stood up, stretched his legs and looked about the room. It was small, with just a desk and two or three chairs. Obviously it served as a conference room of some sort. One wall held the panel of file buttons; another held the telephone and visiphone viewer. Over the visiphone screen, a large lighted panel announced the date in sharp black letters: 32 April, 2109. Below it, the little transistor clock had just changed to read 11:23 A.M. Almost noon. And every passing minute his quarry drew farther and farther away.  He glanced out the window at the rising tiers of buildings. Across the courtyard the first of the ward-towers rose. To one side of it were a series of long, low structures with skylights. These were the kitchens, perhaps, or maintenance buildings. There were dozens of them--any one of which could be hiding Paul Conroe. Jeff clenched his hands until the nails bit his palms. He stared down at the buildings. Conroe could be anywhere down there. _Another man had already seen Dr. Schiml...._  A door clicked behind him and he turned sharply. A man entered the room and closed the door behind him. Smiling, he walked over to the desk. Meyer nodded and watched the man. He felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. For the briefest instant the doctor had caught his eye, and Jeff felt everything that he had planned to say crumble like dust around him.  The man hardly looked like a doctor, although his white jacket was immaculate and a stethoscope peeped from his side pocket. He was tall and slender, almost fifty years old, with round, cheerful pink cheeks and a little pug nose that seemed completely out of place on his face.  A harmless-looking man, Jeff thought, except for his eyes. But his eyes--they were the sharpest, most penetrating eyes Jeff had ever seen. And they were watching him. Quite independent of the smiling face, they watched his every move, studying him. The eyes were full of wisdom, but they were also tinged with caution.  The doctor sat down and motioned Jeff to the seat facing the desk. He pushed a cigar case across the desk to him.  Jeff hesitated, then took one. \"I thought these were slightly illegal,\" he said.  The doctor grinned. \"Slightly. Thanks to us, as you probably know. We did most of the work here on tobacco smoke and cancer--actually got legislation pushed through on it.\" He leaned back easily in his chair as he lit his own cigar. \"Still, one once in a while won't do too much harm. And there's nothing like a good smoke to get things talked out. I'm Roger Schiml, by the way. I didn't get your name.\"  \"Meyer,\" said Jeff. \"Jeffrey Meyer.\"  The doctor's eyes narrowed quizzically. \"I hope my girl didn't bother you too much. She channels most of the volunteer work here, as you see. Then, occasionally, cases come in which she'd rather turn over to me.\" He paused for a moment. \"Cases like yours, for instance.\"  Jeff blinked, his mind racing. It would take acting, he thought, real acting to fool this man. The face was deceptively young and benign, almost complacent. But the eyes were far from young. They were old, old eyes. They had seen more than eyes should see. They missed nothing. To fool a man with eyes like that--Jeff took a deep breath and said, \"I want to join the Mercy Men.\"  Dr. Schiml's eyes widened very slightly. For a long moment he said nothing, just stared at the huge man before him. Then he said, \"That's interesting. It's also very curious. The name, I mean--oh, I can understand the attraction such an idea might have for people, but the name that's become so popular--it baffles me. 'Mercy Men.' It gives you a curious feeling, don't you think? Brings up mental pictures of handsome young interns fighting the forces of evil and death, the brave heroes giving their all for the upward flight of humanity--all that garbage, you know.\" The eyes hardened quite suddenly. \"Where did you hear of the Mercy Men, I wonder?\"  Jeff shrugged. \"The word's been around for quite a while. A snatch here, a story there--even though it isn't advertised too openly.\"  Dr. Schiml looked him straight in the eye. \"And suppose I told you that there is no such organization, either here or anywhere else on Earth that I know of?\"  A tight smile appeared on Jeff's face. \"I'd call you a class-A liar.\"  Schiml's eyebrows went up. \"I see. That's a big word. Maybe you can support it.\"  \"I can. There are Mercy Men here. There have been for several years.\"  \"You're sure of that.\"  \"Quite. I know one. He was a skid-rower with a taste for morphine when I first ran into him--a champagne appetite to go with a beer income. Then he went out of circulation for about six months. Now he has a place up in the Catskills, with many, many thousands of dollars in the bank. Of course, he uses the money to feed several hundred cats in his basement.\" Jeff's eyes narrowed. \"He never liked cats very much before he left here. There are other funny things he does--nothing serious, of course, but peculiar. Still, he doesn't need the dope any more.\"  Schiml smiled and put his fingers together. \"That would be Luke Tandy. Yes, Luke was a little different when he left, but the work was satisfactory and we paid off.\"  \"Yes,\" said Jeff softly. \"One hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Cash on the line. To him or his heirs. He was lucky.\"  \"So what are you doing here?\"  \"I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars too.\"  The doctor's eyes met Jeff's squarely. \"And you are a liar too.\"  Jeff reddened. \"What do you mean--\"  \"Look, let's get this straight right now. Don't lie to me. I'll catch you every time.\" The doctor's eyes were hard. \"I see a man who's eaten well for a long time, wearing dirty but expensive clothes, who doesn't drink, who doesn't use drugs, who is young and strong and capable. He tells me he wants to join the Mercy Men for money. He tells me a lie. Now I'll ask you again: why are you here?\"  \"For money. For one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\"  The doctor sighed and leaned back. \"All right, no matter. We'll go into it later, I suppose. But I think you'd better understand certain things. It's no accident that your information on the Mercy Men is so vague. We've been careful to keep it that way, of course. The more vague the stories, the fewer curiosity-seekers and busybodies we have to contend with. Also, the more distasteful the stories, the more desperate people will become before they come to us. This we particularly desire. Because the work we do here requires a very desperate man to volunteer.\"  As he talked, the doctor brought out a pack of cards from the desk and began riffling them nervously in his fingers. Jeff's eyes caught them and a chill went down his back. They were curious cards, not the regular playing variety. These were smaller, with a peculiar marking system in bright red on the white faces. Jeff shivered and he was puzzled at the chill that gripped his body. He shifted in his chair in growing tension and tried to take his eyes from the cards.  The doctor snubbed out his cigar, leaned back in the chair and gave the cards a riffle and regarded Jeff closely. \"We've done a lot here since the Center opened--work based on years of background research. A century or more ago there were terrible medical problems to be faced: polio was a killer then; they had no idea of cancer control; they were faced with a terrific death rate from heart disease. All those things are beaten now, a thing of the past. But as the old killers moved out, new ones took their place. Look at the half-dozen NVI plagues we've had in the past"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49531"],["title","A Man Obsessed (#4)"],["body"," years--neurotoxic virus infections that started to appear out of nowhere twenty years ago. Look at the alky-sikys you see in every bar today, a completely new type of alcoholism-psychosis that we haven't even been able to describe, much less cure. Look at the statistics on mental disease, rising in geometric progression almost every year.\"  The tall doctor stood up and walked to the window. \"We don't know why it's happening, but it is. Something's on the march, something ghastly and evil among the people. Something that has to be stopped.\" He gave the cards a sharp riffle and tossed them onto the desk with a sigh. \"We can't stop it until we know something about the human brain and how it works, and why it does what it does, and how. We don't even understand fully the structure of the nervous system, much less understand its function. And we've learned all we can from cats and dogs and monkeys. Any further study of a monkey's brain will give us great insight into the neuroses and complexes of monkeys, no doubt. But it won't teach us anything more about _men_.\" His voice was very soft. \"You can see where this leads, I think.\"  Jeff Meyer nodded slowly. \"You need men,\" he said.  \"We need men. Men to study. Cruel as it may sound, men to experiment upon. We can't learn any more from any other variety of ... experimental animal. But there are problems. Toy around with a man's brain and he is likely to die, quite abruptly. Or he may be deranged, or he may go violently insane. Most of the work, however well planned, however certain we were of results, however safe it appeared, proved to be completely unpredictable. Much of the work and many of the results were quite horrible. But we're making progress, slow--but progress nonetheless. So the work continues.  \"It hasn't been very popular. No man in his right mind would volunteer for such a job. So we hired men. For the most truly altruistic work in the world, our workers come with the most mercenary of motives: we pay for their services and we pay well. A hundred thousand dollars is a small fee, on our scale. We have the government behind us. The sky is the limit, if we need a man for a job. The money is paid, when the work is completed, either to the man himself or to his heirs. You see why the name they've given themselves is so curious--Medical Mercenaries, the 'Mercy Men.' That's why a man must be desperate to come to us. That's why we must be so very careful who joins us, for what motives.\"  Jeff Meyer stared at his hands and waited in the silence of the room. His eyes strayed once again to the curious cards, and the chill of fear went through him like a ghastly breeze. This was a port of last resort, a road that could end in horror and death. Ted Bahr had said it wasn't worth it--that Conroe would never escape alive--but he knew that Conroe could. And he knew Conroe well enough to know that he would.  Jeff felt the old bitterness and hatred swell up in his mind, and his hands trembled as he sat. He had long since thrown aside his life as he had known it, cast off the veneer of civilized life that he had acquired, to hunt Paul Conroe down and kill him. There was nothing else in his life that mattered. It had been a long, grueling hunt, tracking him, following him, studying him, tracing his movements and habits, plotting trap after trap, driving the man to desperation. But there had been no indication, anywhere along the line, that Conroe would turn to such a desperate gamble as this.  But he must have known that death otherwise was inevitable. Here he could be changed. He might disappear from the face of the Earth in the oblivion of quiet death, to be sure, but he also might emerge, unscathed, to live in wealth the rest of his life, unrecognizable and safe.  Jeff Meyer looked up at the doctor and his eyes were hard. \"I haven't changed my mind,\" he said. \"What has to be done to join?\"  Dr. Schiml sighed, and turned resignedly to the file panel. \"There are tests that are necessary and rules to be obeyed. You'll be confined and regimented. And once you're assigned to a job and sign a release, you're in.\" He leaned forward and punched the visiphone button. Tapping his fingers idly on the desk, he waited until an image blinked and cleared on the screen. \"Blackie,\" he said tiredly. \"Better send the Nasty Frenchman up here. We've got a new recruit.\"  The visiphone snapped off and Jeff sat frozen to his seat, his pulse throbbing in his neck, every nerve in his body screaming in excitement. The face on the screen had been clearly visible for a moment: a pale face with large gray eyes--a woman's face, surrounded by flowing black hair. It was a face that was impressed indelibly on his memory. It belonged to the girl who had danced the night before in the red light.     CHAPTER THREE   There was no doubt of it. She was the girl in the night club, the dancing girl with the flowing black hair and the mask-like smile, who had led him to Conroe and then brought the spotlight to his face to spring the trap too soon. Frantically Jeff fought to control his excitement. He knew his face was white and he avoided the doctor's puzzled glance. But he couldn't control the angry fire burning in his mind, the little voice screaming out: \"_He's here; he's here, somewhere!_\"  But why was she here? The doctor had called her \"Blackie.\" He had spoken to her with familiarity. Jeff's mind whirled. He had the strangest feeling that he had missed something somewhere along the line, that he knew the answer but couldn't quite grasp it. What could the girl's sudden appearance in the Center involve?  Or had her appearance at the night club been the unusual one?  A buzzer rang and the office door opened to admit a small, weasel-faced man. The doctor looked up and smiled. \"Hello, Jacques. This is Jeff Meyer, the new recruit. Take him down and get him quartered in, all right? And you might brief him a little. He's awfully green.\"  The little man scratched his long nose and regarded Jeff with a nasty smile. \"A new one, huh? Where are you going to line him up?\"  \"No telling. We'll see where the tests put him, first. Then we'll talk about jobs.\"  The smile widened on the little man's face, turning down the end of his long pointed nose and revealing a dirty yellow row of teeth. His eyes ran over Jeff from head to toe. \"Big one too. But then, they fall just as hard as the rest. Want me to take him right down?\"  Schiml nodded. \"Maybe he can still get lunch.\" His eyes shifted to Jeff. \"This is the Nasty Frenchman,\" he said, motioning toward the little man with his thumb. \"He's been around for a long time; he can show you the ropes. And don't let him bother you too much--his sense of humor, I mean. Like I say, he's been around here a long time. You'll get quarters and you'll be expected to stay with your group for meals and everything else. That means no contacts outside the hospital as long as you're here. You'll get the daily news reports, and there are magazines and books in the library. If you've got other business outside, you haven't any business in here. Any time you leave the Center it's considered an automatic breach of contract.\"  He paused for a long moment and gave Jeff a strange look, almost a half smile. \"And you'll find that questions aren't appreciated around here, Jeff. Any kind of questions. The men don't like people too much when they ask questions.\"  The Nasty Frenchman shuffled his feet nervously, and Jeff started out the door. Then the little man turned back to Dr. Schiml. \"They brought Tinker back from the table about ten minutes ago. He's in pretty bad shape. Maybe you should look at him?\"  \"This was the big job today, wasn't it?\" Schiml's eyes were sharp. \"What did Dr. Bartel say?\"  \"He said no dice. It was a bust.\"  \"I see. Well, it may be just the diodrax wearing off now, but I'll be down to see.\"  The Nasty Frenchman grunted and turned back to Jeff. His face still wore the nasty little grin. \"Let's go, big boy,\" he said, and started down the hall.         *       *       *       *       *  Jeff watched the corridors as they passed, counting them one by one, trying desperately to keep himself oriented. He glanced at his watch and angrily sucked in his breath. Minutes were slipping by, precious minutes, minutes that could mean success or failure. A thousand questions crowded his mind, and behind them all was the girl. She was the key, he was sure of it. She would know where Conroe was, where he could be found....  They reached an elevator, stepped aboard and shot down at such dizzying speed that Jeff nearly choked. Then, suddenly, they came to a jolting stop and stepped into a dingy, gray corridor that was dimly lit by bare bulbs in the ceiling.  The Nasty Frenchman punched a button in the wall and turned to regard Jeff. The sneering little smile was still on his lips as the far-off rumble of a jitney grew to a sharp clatter. A little car dropped down from its ceiling track. The little man hopped in nimbly and motioned Jeff in beside him. Then the car took off for the ceiling again, swinging crazily and speeding down the maze of corridors and curves.  Jeff stirred uneasily, growing more and more confused with every turn. \"Look,\" he broke out finally, \"where's this thing taking us?\"  The Nasty Frenchman turned pale eyes toward him. \"You worried or something?\"  \"Well, it looks like we're headed for the center of the Earth. I'd like to be able to find my way out sometime--\"  \"Why?\"  The question was so blunt that it left Jeff's jaw sagging for a moment. \"Well, I'm not planning to spend the rest of my life in here.\"  The Nasty Frenchman guffawed. It was not a pleasant laugh. \"Here for a nice restful vacation, huh? You wise guys are all the same. Go ahead, dream--I won't bother you.\"  The little man turned his attention to the controls and the car swung sharply to the right and headed down another corridor. Jeff scowled as he watched the lighted corridors flash by. Were they speeding so far,"]]]
