How did you get out?\"  \"Why, through the court of the lions, of course.\"  \"They might have killed you.\"  \"So I thought; but the king's ocelots are well fed. They did not care to get up to dine off me in the middle of the night.\"  The rainbow colors of the dawn of the tropics illumined the sky to the east, and below, the hills were swathed in pearl gray mist. Alma breathed deep as he looked at Zara, fresh and radiant as the morning itself. The fleecy robe she had slipped on parted at the throat, her dark head was swathed in a pale blue gauze, broidered with silver stars, and not all the turmoil of the night could disguise the fact that she was young and glad to be alive. As she lifted a slender, rounded, white arm to indicate the violet and orange of the horizon, Alma caught her in his arms.  \"Come with me,\" he whispered, \"away from this wicked place. Let me teach you the principles of Abinadi. Together let us live our lives as he has taught, in conformity with the will of the Lord.\"  \"Abinadi!\" she murmured. \"I already believe in him, although he has taught the strange doctrine that we must return good for evil, instead of demanding an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But you must teach me. Alma,\" she added fearfully, \"for there are many things I do not understand. And this strange doctrine of repentance, that they talk so much about--\"  \"The king had better take to heart,\" Alma finished grimly. \"Would that the scales might fall from his eyes, as they have from mine!\"  \"He is going to put Abinadi to death?\"  \"So I fear.\"  \"And you?\"  \"Oh, I shall take up the work where he left off. I'm afraid his mantle will fall on unworthy shoulders. I have carefully written down all his words, and I shall teach them to the people when he is gone. I consecrate my life to the work. God grant me strength and light to do it well!\"  \"Does Abinadi know?\"  \"Yes; I go now to visit him in his cell.\"  \"Tarry a little, Sir Prophet,\" she commanded, running her hand through his yellow hair.  Together they watched the sun rise. The mocking birds sang riotously. The lavender flowers of the bougainvilaea drooped in the garden, while from the patio below the air came laden with the heavy odor of the blossom called \"The Perfume of the Night.\" The lovers did not notice that with it was mingled the scent of the ill-omened \"Flower of the Dead.\"  III.  THE EXECUTION.  The great market place was the heart of the city. The streets, like so many arteries, emptied into its pulsating center. There all the buying and selling went on. Here was a fruit stand from which a bronze Lamanitish goddess flicked the flies. Yonder was a clothier's containing garments of chameleon dyes. There were cafes, candy stands, butcher shops, fish from the lake, venders of pottery, and makers of lace. The band played there in the afternoon, and lovers sought the shade of its arbors in the evening.  This morning something of unusual occurrence was about to happen. People were running hither and thither. There was a hushed murmur of excitement among the crowds, which were larger than on any market day. Four regiments of soldiers were stationed at the comers, while a fifth was keeping the people back from an open space in the middle of the square.  \"Wherefore the crowd?\" asked the countryman who had just brought his cart of vegetables to the city that morning, of a young man who was hurrying to the scene.  The other looked at him in surprise, \"Why, they are going to burn the Prophet Abinadi.\"  \"They're not going to burn him alive?\"  \"How do you think they'd burn him--dead?\" he threw back over his shoulder, as he hurried on.  The crowd was impatient.  \"Light the fire, and let us see if this false prophet is pluckily true to his convictions.\"  \"What are they waiting for?\" called another.  There was a blare of trumpets, a blast of martial music, and then the cry, \"Make way for the king!\"  On a palanquin, borne aloft on the shoulders of men, surmounted by a green canopy, reclined the king. As soon as he reached the place of execution he ordered the soldiers to bring forth the prisoner. When Abinadi, sustained by the heroism of martyrdom, but very weak and trembling physically, stood before him, Noah pronounced sternly: \"Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee and thou art worthy of death; for thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men, and now for this cause thou shalt be put to death, unless thou wilt recall all the words thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.\"  With a hunted look in his eyes Abinadi answered: \"I will not recall the words I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true. I will suffer even unto death. I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me, ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall stand as a testimony against you at the last day.\"  The words touched even the callous heart of Noah, and he was half convinced. He turned to the priests.  \"Shall we release him?\"  \"Death to Abinadi, he has reviled the king!\" was the shout.  \"Death to Abinadi!\"  \"Let his God delay the flames!\"  \"He says we shall all be captives to the Lamanites!\"  \"Down with false prophets!\"  Amid the maledictions, they bound Abinadi to the stake and lighted the fagots under his feet.  As the flames licked his quivering limbs, and he writhed in agony, he looked into the faces of the terror-stricken populace and said in accents thick, \"It will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities. Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts. And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies.\"  As the flames mounted higher and higher, and the victim writhed in agony, a young man, with sunny hair, made his way out of the crowd, for he could stand it no longer. Henceforth he was the disciple of the dead prophet, and the blood of martyrdom had won its first convert in Alma.  His was not the only sick heart, for when the agonized victim looked out of his pain-dimmed eyes and said prophetically to Noah, \"Ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire,\" the king called suddenly, \"Ho, take me hence!\"  IV.  THE WATERS OF MORMON.  Gloom reigned in the palace and in the heart of Zara. The death of Abinadi seemed to portend evil. Alma was condemned to death, and guards were scouting the country for him, for he had disappeared. Zara was torn with fear, for she expected daily to see him dragged there in irons. Again she thought he had been secretly murdered, and this hunting for him was a pretense.  Then a message came to her. She sent for Amulon, who came gladly, for she had locked herself up in her apartments and refused to see him for days, while he, whose will was law, chafed like a chained lion. She was peculiarly gracious, and it was with difficulty he restrained himself, for his love for this maiden, who was the first who had ever opposed him, swept him off his feet.  \"I have a favor to ask of you. Amulon, as always,\" she began.  \"Which is already granted, if it lies within my power, princess.\"  \"Ever am I more indebted to you.\"  \"What is my lady's latest caprice?\"  \"You know I am virtually a prisoner here. All of the palace is mine, but the bird is none the less barred because the cage is gilded. An aged aunt of mine is dying, and she has sent for me to soothe her last hours. I would go to her bedside. Will you not ask the king's permission that I may go?\"  Amulon was touched by her earnestness, for ever are strong men weakest through their strength.  \"Go, Zara, and I will be responsible to the king.\" He stepped to the door and summoned Mulek. \"Do you accompany this lady wherever she goes. See that no harm approaches, and return her in safety to the palace.\"  Mulek bowed and retreated.  Zara sallied out accompanied by the giant soldier Mulek. They made their way to a large house with a stone front. They entered, and passed through corridor after corridor, until they came to the one that led to the death chamber.  \"You will wait here for me, Mulek?\"  \"The Lord Amulon said I was not to let you out of my sight.\"  \"But you can't go in there when she is dying!\"  \"I go where you do,\" he answered doggedly.  She was in despair. But everyone has his vulnerable point. She began to plead with him, using all her art, but he only shook his head. She tore a heavy gold chain from her neck. Three great emeralds hung pendant from it. The bauble was worth a fortune. She thrust it into his hand, saying imperiously, \"Wait here, I will soon be back.\"  Before he could recover himself she was gone. His first impulse was to follow her, but he distinguished the sound of a woman's voice, and it deterred him.  The giant waited a long time. He paced restlessly around the room. When the afternoon sun faded into evening he grew alarmed. He rang a bell, which no one answered. He walked through the deserted halls. He came back and went to the room of the sick woman. There was no couch there, and a new light broke in on him. He ran through the house shouting. A Lamanitish woman, a servant, confronted him.  \"Where is Zara, the daughter of Gideon?\" he fairly shouted.  She eyed him calmly. \"I know of no such a woman.\"  \"I brought her here,\" he reiterated.  \"She is not here,\" she repeated.  He rushed through the house, but found no trace of her whom he sought. His first impulse was to flee and escape the anger of Amulon. But on second thought he decided that would look as if he had connived at her escape. If he reported at once, she might yet be found. He started on a run back to the palace.  When he presented himself before Amulon, a sweating, palpitating, trembling wretch, the courtier gave him one look and then roared, \"Where is the girl?\"  \"Alas, I know not!\" wailed the other. \"I turned, m'lord, and she was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50955"],["title","The Cities of the Sun (#3)"],["body","e. Some power of magic--\" he dodged a heavy bronze vase that Amulon, in his rage, hurled, at his head. It crashed into the door beyond and splintered it.  The chief priest clapped his hands. Slaves appeared.  \"Take him,\" he commanded. \"Let him be lashed. Send soldiers to search the house of Zeezrom, and arrest every one you find there.\"  All night Amulon paced the palace, and all night rose the shrieks of Mulek, lashed to the whipping post.  In the meantime Zara, after her escape from Mulek, was being borne through tall hedges of organ cactus on the outskirts of the city. Through fields of maguey--the large century plant--until they reached the prairie where the mesquite grew, they continued their flight.  [Illustration: ALMA BAPTIZING IN THE WATERS OF MORMON.]  Beyond, palm trees were gracefully silhouetted against the sky. Plantains rattled in the wind. As they neared the oasis, they felt the dread stillness of the tropic jungle, for the night was coming on. The rich velvet of the sward was flecked with the wild tulip, and long mosses cast black shadows in a pool as clear and deep as a woman's eyes.  Such were the Waters of Mormon, where Alma, the sweet-spirited, baptized believers and taught the gospel of the Savior, thus carrying on the work of Abinadi.  When the slaves stopped, and Alma saw that the white palanquin bore a woman, he came forward. Zara slipped lightly out, without assistance, and ran to meet him.  \"Zara!\" he exclaimed.  \"It is I, Alma.\" Then she continued breathlessly, \"They have located you. The sentence of death hangs over you and your followers. You must flee quickly.\"  \"How did you find out?\"  \"Ever since you went away I have lived on the name of Alma. Every breath that concerned you my intuition has ferreted out. The armies of the king have orders to march against you now, for the king fears the stronghold you are gaining among the people.\"  \"And you came to tell me this! If they knew it, what would they do to you?\"  \"I don't know; I'm not going back to find out.\"  \"Not going back?\"  \"No; I'm going with you--if you will let me.\"  \"Let you, Zara!\" A look of glad surprise broke over his face, as he took her tenderly in his arms. But amid all his joyful exultation, there was a fear in his heart of hearts. He knew that behind his cherished one lay luxury and pleasure, and ahead of her was--the desert.  V.  THE FLIGHT.  Consternation reigned in the palace. The unsuccessful army returned, announcing the escape of Alma and four hundred and fifty of his followers. Amulon, in an angry mood, and the king had had words over the disappearance of Zara. Noah foresaw trouble with her father, and Gideon was one of his best generals. Nor was he mistaken, for along came the sturdy old soldier demanding to see his daughter. Noah explained that the girl was gone, that every effort had been made to locate her, but without avail.  Gideon did not believe it. He thought they were deceiving him. He poured execrations on their heads.  \"There is only one fate that awaits a woman that steps inside your palace. Were there not enough, but my daughter must grace your court? She was of a different type, and that was why you coveted her. You have lied to me, for you have something to conceal. A father's curse be on you!\"  It was in vain that the king denied any knowledge of Zara's whereabouts. He had been involved in so many intrigues that he was not believed when he spoke the truth.  \"Curse you. You will tell me where she is, or I will run you through!\" and Gideon drew his sword. \"It would be a service to rid the Nephites of such a tyrant.\"  Noah could have summoned his guards, but Gideon had challenged him as man to man. The king had been a soldier in his youth, but years of dissipation had rendered his flesh flabby and his spirit afraid.  They crossed swords and lunged at each other. A few moments and the king was breathless. Gideon so evidently had the advantage that Noah, in sheer cowardice, turned and fled. He rushed to the temple. With drawn sword Gideon followed him. Through chamber after chamber the king ran. The rooms were superb with their mosaic and metal work, but Noah did not notice any of the decorations, for after him followed grim Nemesis. The two flying figures, one very little behind the other, reached the top of the second pyramid. Noah mounted the steps that led to the top of the tower. This was ascended by a series of ladders, and when he reached the second he kicked the first from under him. When he reached the top his face was purple, and every breath was a pain. He could go no further, and he knew that his respite was short. He looked down from the dizzy height. Then he lost himself in astonishment.  \"Let me down!\" he screamed. \"The armies of the Lamanites are upon us!\"  Gideon, deeming this but a ruse, was in no wise deterred in his pursuit.  \"I tell you they are spread out in battle array on the plains below! Let me down that I may save my people!\" pleaded Noah.  \"Save your people? you had better save your own neck,\" Gideon thought grimly. He went to the parapet and looked over. The king was right, there were the Lamanite phalanxes spread out upon the plain as far as the eye could see.  \"Come down and save your people,\" he called, sheathing his sword. He himself went over and began to beat the alarum drum to call the men to arms. As the old king tottered down there was time for a new fear to supplant the other. None knew better than he how illy his kingdom was prepared for war. He had made his people lovers of pleasure. The standing army was small, and no match for the fierce Indians inured to hardship.  \"Call the people together and tell them to bring their families and flee into the wilderness,\" he commanded. \"It were folly to fight them here.\"  When all the people of the city congregated, Noah, like a good leader, led the flight.  The Lamanites were not slow to discover the tactics, and started out in swift pursuit. They soon overtook the Nephites and the massacre commenced. Noah, maddened by the sight of the blood, bade the heralds command all the men to flee, for they were retarded by the women and children.  \"They will not murder the women in cold blood,\" reasoned the valorous king, \"and some of us may be saved while Gideon engages the enemy here.\"  Like geese that follow their leader, on the spur of the moment many of the men turned and followed the king and his priests, who were in full flight.  After they had gone some distance into the wilderness, they began to come to their senses. One commoner voiced the sentiment of the men when he said, \"If our loved ones are slain, it were better that we had perished with them.\"  \"But, at least, after first striking a blow in their defense,\" added another.  \"Let us go back and see if they are dead. And if they are,\"--here the speaker looked meaningly at Noah--\"we will seek revenge.\"  \"We are a laughing stock and a bye word,\" said one man who prided himself on his honor.  They were all heartily ashamed of themselves, and, as is always the case under such circumstances, they sought someone on whom to lay the blame. Whereupon, when the king commanded them not to return, it brought their anger to a head. Instead of obeying him, they turned viciously upon him as the cause of all their misfortunes. They overpowered him roughly and bound him hand and foot. Amulon, who at least had the saving grace of loyalty, was the only one who drew his sword in defense of the king. He was run through the side for his pains. The other priests, for their part, seeing themselves so out-numbered, took to their heels.  Amulon, weak from loss of blood, staggered over to a brush heap, and there they let him lie. With presence of mind, he stuffed his shirt into the wound and staunched the flow of blood. He was in a raging fever, and one of the men taking pity on him as he tossed with sleepless eyes, brought him a cup of water.  When night was well advanced, he dragged himself down to a stream and drank deep of the running water. He was conscious of the fact that no one had paid any attention to him. To attempt the escape of Noah, he knew was hopeless. He felt that the king must have help, and have it quickly. Urged on by some power beyond himself, the wounded man arose and staggered out into the jungle.  He found the priests, or rather, they found him wandering in the woods, and Amulon, by his old power of eloquence, rallied them and brought them back. But lo, when they arrived at the place where the Nephites had camped, they were gone, and Amulon feared that in his daze he had mistaken the place. But Himni raised a shout, and they found only too ghastly evidence of the recent presence of the Nephites. The trunk of an immense tree had been partially burned. Lashed to its side was what was left of a man, under whom a fire had been built. One of the priests walked over, and from the ashes picked out the king's signet ring. They had burned Noah to death. Thus had the prophecy of Abinadi been fulfilled.  \"His life was as a garment in a furnace of fire.\"  VI.  THE ABDUCTION.  Like nomads the priests wandered into the forest, subsisting on berries and wild game. One day Omo, the voluptuary, came into camp with what for him was unusual speed. The men loafing around the camp began to jeer at him.  \"I have seen such a sight--\" he began.  \"You must have seen something to make you run. He has seen such a sight--\"  \"As you would all break your necks to see.\"  \"What have you seen?\"  \"Women.\"  \"Women!\" they muttered.  \"Girls--young, beautiful, graceful as gazelles.\"  \"He has been seeing visions.\"  \"Listen. As I lay under a willow, that I might digest my dinner out of the heat of the sun, I did hear singing and laughter--\"  \"He was asleep and dreamed it.\"  \"Very cautiously did I crawl out, and there I beheld fifty Lamanitish maidens--\"  \"Lamanites! Huh!\"  \"Fifty Lamanitish damsels, as I did start to say, wreathed with garlands and bedecked with golden circlets on their arms and ankles,"]]]
