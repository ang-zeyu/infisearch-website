In the field, none, of course.\"  \"Seest, father?\"  \"What thinkst me, vixen, a spineless cuddlepet? From this minute 'til return here I match your paragon youngblade loll for loll, cup for cup, wench for wench. Is it what you've been niggling at me to say?\"  \"Aye, father and king, exactly--for as you say, you do.\" She hugged him so fervently as almost to lift him off the ground, kissed him twice, and hurried away.  \"A thing I would like to talk to you about, sire,\" Tedric said quickly, before the king could bring up any of the matters just past. \"Armor. There was enough of the god-metal to equip three men fully, and headnecks for their horses. You, sire, and me, and Sciro of your Guard. Break precedent, sire, I beg, and wear me this armor of proof instead of the gold; for what we face promises to be worse than anything you or I have yet seen.\"  \"I fear me 'tis true, but 'tis impossible, nonetheless. Lomarr's king wears gold. He fights in gold; at need he dies in gold.\"  And that was, Tedric knew, very definitely that. It was senseless, it was idiotic, but it was absolutely true. No king of Lomarr could possibly break that particular precedent. To appear in that spectacularly conspicuous fashion, one flashing golden figure in a sea of dull iron-gray, was part of the king's job. The fact that his father and his grandfather and so on for six generations back had died in golden armor could not sway him, any more than it could have swayed Tedric himself in similar case. But there might be a way out.  \"But need it be _solid_ gold, sire? Wouldst not an overlay of gold suffice?\"  \"Yea, Lord Tedric, and 'twould be a welcome thing indeed. I yearn not, nor did my father nor his father, to pit gold 'gainst hard-swung axe; e'en less to hide behind ten ranks of iron while others fight. But simply 'tis not possible. If the gold be thick enough for the rivets to hold, 'tis too heavy to lift. If thin enough to be possible of wearing, the gold flies off in sheets at first blow and the fraud is revealed. Hast ideas? I listen.\"  \"I know not, sire....\" Tedric thought for minutes. \"I have seen gold hammered into thin sheets ... but not thin enough ... but it might be possible to hammer it thin enough to be overlaid on the god-metal with pitch or gum. Wouldst wear it so, sire?\"  \"Aye, my Tedric, and gladly: just so the overlay comes not off by handsbreadths under blow of sword or axe.\"  \"Handsbreadths? Nay. Scratches and mars, of course, easily to be overlaid again ere next day's dawn. But handsbreadths? Nay, sire.\"  \"In that case, try; and may Great Llosir guide your hand.\"  Tedric went forthwith to the castle and got a chunk of raw, massy gold. He took it to his shop and tried to work it into the thin, smooth film he could visualize so clearly.  And tried--and tried--and tried.  And failed--and failed--and failed.  He was still trying--and still failing--three weeks later. Time was running short; the hours that had formerly dragged like days now flew like minutes. His crew had done their futile best to help; Bendon, his foreman, was still standing by. The king was looking on and offering advice. So were Rhoann and Trycie. Sciro and Schillan and other more or less notable persons were also trying to be of use.  Tedric, strained and tense, was pounding carefully at a sheet of his latest production. It was a pitiful thing--lumpy in spots, ragged and rough, with holes where hammer had met anvil through its substance. The smith's left hand twitched at precisely the wrong instant, just as the hammer struck. The flimsy sheet fell into three ragged pieces.  Completely frustrated, Tedric leaped backward, swore fulminantly, and hurled the hammer with all his strength toward the nearest wall. And in that instant there appeared, in the now familiar cage-like structure of shimmering, interlaced bars, the form of flesh that was Llosir the god. High in the air directly over the forge the apparition hung, motionless and silent, and stared.  Everyone except Tedric gave homage to the god, but he merely switched from the viciously corrosive Devossian words he had been using to more parliamentary Lomarrian.  \"Is it possible, Lord Sir, for any human being to do anything with this foul, slimy, salvy, perverse, treacherous, and generally-bedamned stuff?\"  \"It is. Definitely. Not only possible, but fairly easy and fairly simple, if the proper tools, apparatus, and techniques are employed,\" Llosir's bell-toned-organ pseudo-voice replied. \"Ordinarily, in your lifetime, you would come to know nothing of gold leaf--although really _thin_ gold leaf is not required here--nor of gold-beater's skins and membranes and how to use them, nor of the adhesives to be employed and the techniques of employing them. The necessary tools and materials are, or can very shortly be made, available to you; you can now absorb quite readily the required information and knowledge.  \"For this business of beating out gold leaf, your hammer and anvil are both completely wrong. Listen carefully and remember. For the first, preliminary thinning down, you take ...\"[A]         *       *       *       *       *  Lomarr's army set out at dawn. First the wide-ranging scouts: lean, hard, fine-trained runners, stripped to clouts and moccasins and carrying only a light bow and a few arrows apiece. Then the hunters. They, too, scattered widely and went practically naked: but bore the hundred-pound bows and the savagely-tearing arrows of their trade.  Then the Heavy Horse, comparatively few in number, but of the old blood all, led by Tedric and Sciro and surrounding glittering Phagon and his standard-bearers. It took a lot of horse to carry a full-armored knight of the Old Blood, but the horse-farmers of the Middle Marches bred for size and strength and stamina.  Next came century after century of light horse--mounted swordsmen and spearmen and javelineers--followed by even more numerous centuries of foot-slogging infantry.  Last of all came the big-wheeled, creaking wagons: loaded, not only with the usual supplies and equipment of war, but also with thousands of loaves of bread--hard, flat, heavy loaves made from ling, the corn-like grain which was the staple cereal of the region.  \"Bread, sire?\" Tedric had asked, wonderingly, when Phagon had first broached the idea. Men on the march lived on meat--a straight, unrelieved diet of meat for weeks and months on end--and all too frequently not enough of that to maintain weight and strength. They expected nothing else; an occasional fist-sized chunk of bread was sheerest luxury. \"Bread! A whole loaf each man a day?\"  \"Aye,\" Phagon had chuckled in reply. \"All farmsmen along the way will have ready my fraction of ling, and Schillan will at need buy more. To each man a loaf each day, and all the meat he can eat. 'Tis why we go up the Midvale, where farmsmen all breed savage dogs to guard their fields 'gainst hordes of game. Such feeding will be noised abroad. Canst think of a better device to lure Taggad's ill-fed mercenaries to our standards?\"  Tedric couldn't.  There is no need to dwell in detail upon the army's long, slow march. Leaving the city of Lompoar, it moved up the Lotar River, through the spectacularly scenic gorge of the Coast Range, and into the Middle Valley; that incredibly lush and fertile region which, lying between the Low Umpasseurs on the east and the Coast Range on the west, comprised roughly a third of Lomarr's area. Into and through the straggling hamlet of Bonoy, lying at the junction of the Midvale River with the Lotar. Then straight north, through the timberlands and meadows of the Midvale's west bank.  Game was, as Phagon had said, incredibly plentiful; out-numbering by literally thousands to one both domestic animals and men. Buffalo-like lippita, moose-like rolatoes, pig-like accides--the largest and among the tastiest of Lomarr's game animals--were so abundant that one good hunter could kill in half an hour enough to feed a century for a day. Hence most of the hunters' time was spent in their traveling dryers, preserving meat against a coming day of need.  On, up the bluely placid Lake Midvale, a full day's march long and half that in width. Past the Chain Lakes, strung on the river like beads on a string. Past Lake Ardo, and on toward Lake Middlemarch and the Middlemarch Castle which was to be Tedric's official residence henceforth.  As the main body passed the head of the lake, a couple of scouts brought in a runner bursting with news.  \"Thank Sarpedion, sire, I had not to run to Lompoar to reach you!\" he cried, dropping to his knees. \"Middlemarch Castle is besieged! Hurlo of the Marches is slain!\" and he went on to tell a story of onslaught and slaughter.  \"And the raiders worn iron,\" Phagon remarked, when the tale was done. \"Sarlonian iron, no doubt?\"  \"Aye, sire, but how couldst ...\"  \"No matter. Take him to the rear. Feed him.\"  \"You _expected_ this raid, sire,\" Tedric said, rather than asked, after scouts and runner had disappeared.  \"Aye. 'Twas no raid, but the first skirmish of a war. No fool, Taggad of Sarlon; nor Issian of Devoss, barbarian though he is. They knew what loomed, and struck first. The only surprise was Hurlo's death ... he had my direct orders not to do battle 'gainst any force, however slight-seeming, but to withdraw forthwith into the castle, which was to be kept stocked to withstand a siege of months ... this keeps me from boiling him in oil for stupidity, incompetence, and disloyalty.\"  Phagon frowned in thought, then went on: \"Were there forces that appeared not...? Surely not--Taggad would not split his forces at all seriously: 'tis but to annoy me ... or perhaps they are mostly barbarians despite the Sarlonian iron ... to harry and flee is no doubt their aim, but for Lomarr's good not one of them should escape. Knowst the Upper Midvale, Tedric, above the lake?\"  \"But little, sire; a few"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49462"],["title","Lord Tedric (#4)"],["body","only. I was there but once.\"  \"'Tis enough. Take half the Royal Guard and a century of bowmen. Cross the Midvale at the ford three miles above us here. Go up and around the lake. The Upper Midvale is fordable almost anywhere at this season, so stay far enough away from the lake that none see you. Cross it, swing in a wide circle toward the peninsula on which sits Middlemarch Castle, and in three days...?\"  \"Three days will be ample, sire.\"  \"Three days from tomorrow's dawn, exactly as the top rim of the sun clears the meadow, make your charge out of the covering forest, with your archers spread to pick off all who seek to flee. I will be on this side of the peninsula; between us they'll be ground like ling. None shall get away!\"  Phagon's assumptions, however, were slightly in error. When Tedric's riders charged, at the crack of the indicated dawn, they did not tear through a motley horde of half-armored, half-trained barbarians. Instead, they struck two full centuries of Sarlon's heaviest armor! And Phagon the King fared worse. At first sight of that brilliant golden armor a solid column of armored knights formed as though by magic and charged it at full gallop!  Phagon fought, of course; fought as his breed had always fought. At first on horse, with his terrible sword, under the trenchant edge of which knight after knight died. His horse dropped, slaughtered; his sword was knocked away; but, afoot, the war-axe chained to his steel belt by links of super-steel was still his. He swung and swung and swung again; again and again; and with each swing an enemy ceased to live; but sheer weight of metal was too much. Finally, still swinging his murderous weapon, Phagon of Lomarr went flat on the ground.  At the first assault on their king, Tedric with his sword and Sciro with his hammer had gone starkly berserk. Sciro was nearer, but Tedric was faster and stronger and had the better horse.  \"Dreegor!\" he yelled, thumping his steed's sides with his armored legs and rising high in his stirrups. Nostrils flaring, the mighty beast raged forward and Tedric struck as he had never struck before. Eight times that terrific blade came down, and eight men and eight horses died. Then, suddenly--Tedric never did know how it happened, since Dreegor was later found uninjured--he found himself afoot. No place for sword, this, but made to order for axe. Hence, driving forward as resistlessly as though a phalanx of iron were behind him, he hewed his way toward his sovereign.  Thus he was near at hand when Phagon went down. So was doughty Sciro; and by the time the Sarlonians had learned that sword nor axe nor hammer could cut or smash that gold-seeming armor fury personified was upon them. Tedric straddled his king's head, Sciro his feet; and, back to back, two of Lomarr's mightiest armsmasters wove circular webs of flying steel through which it was sheerest suicide to attempt to pass. Thus battle raged until the last armored foeman was down.  \"Art hurt, sire?\" Tedric asked anxiously as he and Sciro lifted Phagon to his feet.  \"Nay, my masters-at-arms,\" the monarch gasped, still panting for breath. \"Bruised merely, and somewhat winded.\" He opened his visor to let more air in; then, as he regained control, he shook off the supporting hands and stood erect under his own power. \"I fear me, Tedric, that you and that vixen daughter of mine were in some sense right. Methinks I may be--Oh, the veriest trifle!--out of condition. But the battle is almost over. Did any escape?\"  None had.  \"'Tis well. Tedric, I know not how to honor....\"  \"Honor me no farther, sire, I beg. Hast honored me already far more than I deserved, or ever will.... Or, at least, at the moment ... there may be later, perhaps ... that is, a thing ...\" he fell silent.  \"A thing?\" Phagon grinned broadly. \"I know not whether Rhoann will be overly pleased at being called so, but 'twill be borne in mind nonetheless. Now you, Sciro; Lord Sciro now and henceforth, and all your line. Lord of what I will not now say; but when we have taken Sarlo you and all others shall know.\"  \"My thanks, sire, and my obeisance,\" said Sciro.  \"Schillan, with me to my pavilion. I am weary and sore, and would fain rest.\"  As the two Lords of the Realm, so lately commoners, strode away to do what had to be done:  \"Neither of us feels any nobler than ever, I know,\" Sciro said, \"but in one way 'tis well--very well indeed.\"  \"The Lady Trycie, eh? The wind does set so, then, as I thought.\"  \"Aye. For long and long. It wondered me often, your choice of the Lady Rhoann over _her_. Howbeit, 'twill be a wondrous thing to be your brother-in-law as well as in arms.\"  Tedric grinned companionably, but before he could reply they had to separate and go to work.  The king did not rest long; the heralds called Tedric in before half his job was done.  \"What thinkst you, Tedric, should be next?\" Phagon asked.  \"First punish Devoss, sire!\" Tedric snarled. \"Back-track them--storm High Pass if defended--raze half the steppes with sword and torch--drive them the full length of their country and into Northern Sound!\"  \"Interesting, my impetuous youngblade, but not at all practical,\" Phagon countered. \"Hast considered the matter of time--the avalanches of rocks doubtless set up and ready to sweep those narrow paths--what Taggad would be doing while we cavort through the wastelands?\"  Tedric deflated almost instantaneously. \"Nay, sire,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"I thought not of any such.\"  \"'Tis the trouble with you--you know not _how_ to think.\" Phagon was deadly serious now. \"'Tis a hard thing to learn; impossible for many; but learn it you must if you end not as Hurlo ended. Also, take heed: disobey my orders but once, as Hurlo did, and you hang in chains from the highest battlement of your own Castle Middlemarch until your bones rot apart and drop into the lake.\"  His monarch's vicious threat--or rather, promise--left Tedric completely unmoved. \"'Tis what I would deserve, sire, or less; but no fear of that. Stupid I may be, but disloyal? Nay, sire. Your word always has been and always will be my law.\"  \"Not stupid, Tedric, but lacking in judgment, which is not as bad; since the condition is, if you care enough to make it so, remediable. You _must_ care enough, Tedric. You _must_ learn, and quickly; for much more than your own life is at hazard.\"  The younger man stared questioningly and the king went on: \"My life, the lives of my family, and the future of all Lomarr,\" he said quietly.  \"In that case, sire, wilt learn, and quickly,\" Tedric declared; and, as days and weeks went by, he did.         *       *       *       *       *  \"ALL previous attempts on the city of Sarlo were made in what seemed to be the only feasible way--crossing the Tegula at Lower Ford, going down its north bank through the gorge to the West Branch, and down that to the Sarlo.\" Phagon was lecturing from a large map, using a sharp stick as pointer; Tedric, Sciro, Schillan, and two or three other high-ranking officers were watching and listening. \"The West Branch flows into Sarlo only forty miles above Sarlo Bay. The city of Sarlo is here, on the north bank of the Sarlo River, right on the Bay, and is five-sixths surrounded by water. The Sarlo River is wide and deep, uncrossable against any real opposition. Thus, Sarlonian strategy has always been not to make any strong stand anywhere along the West Branch, but to fight delaying actions merely--making their real stand on the north bank of the Sarlo, only a few miles from Sarlo City itself. The Sarlo River, gentlemen, is well called 'Sarlo's Shield.' It has never been crossed.\"  \"How do you expect to cross it, then, sire?\" Schillan asked.  \"Strictly speaking, we cross it not, but float down it. We cross the Tegula at Upper Ford, not Lower....\"  \"_Upper_ Ford, sire? Above the terrible gorge of the Low Umpasseurs?\"  \"Yea. That gorge, undefended, is passable. 'Tis rugged, but passage can be made. Once through the gorge our way to the Lake of the Spiders, from which springs the Middle Branch of the Sarlo, is clear and open.\"  \"But 'tis held, sire, that Middle Valley is impassable for troops,\" a grizzled captain protested.  \"We traverse it, nonetheless. On rafts, at six or seven miles an hour, faster by far than any army can march. But 'tis enough of explanation. Lord Sciro, attend!\"  \"I listen, sire.\"  \"At earliest dawn take two centuries of axemen and one century of bowmen, with the wagonload of wood-workers' supplies about which some of you have wondered. Strike straight north at forced march. Cross the Tegula. Straight north again, to the Lake of the Spiders and the head of the Middle Branch. Build rafts, large enough and of sufficient number to bear our whole force; strong enough to stand rough usage. The rafts should be done, or nearly, by the time we get there.\"  \"I hear, sire, and I obey.\"  Tedric, almost stunned by the novelty and audacity of this, the first amphibian operation in the history of his world, was dubious but willing. And as the map of that operation spread itself in his mind, he grew enthusiastic.  \"We attack then, not from the south but from the north-east!\"  \"Aye, and on solid ground, not across deep water. But to bed, gentlemen--tomorrow the clarions sound before dawn!\"  Dawn came. Sciro and his force struck out. The main army marched away, up the north bank of the Upper Midvale, which for thirty or forty miles flowed almost directly from the north-east. There, however, it circled sharply to flow from the south-east and the Lomarrians left it, continuing their march across undulating foothills straight for Upper Ford. From the south, the approach to this ford, lying just above (east of) the Low Umpasseur Mountains, at the point where the Middle Marches mounted a stiff but not abrupt gradient to become the Upper Marches, was not too difficult. Nor was the entrapment of most of the Sarlonians and barbarians on watch. The stream, while only knee-deep for the most part, was"]]]
