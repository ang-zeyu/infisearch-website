It had not long to wait.  A hint came by some underground channel that Professor Hawkins had offered a suggestion to the American government that had been accepted as a basis for experiment. A reporter went post-haste to the professor's home. He was admitted, but the professor would not see him at the moment. The reporter sat down patiently to wait. A motor car drove up to the house and a man in soldier's uniform stepped out. The reporter gave a whistle. A second car discharged a quietly dressed man in civilian clothes attended by two other army officers. The reporter stared. He recognized the men. Most people on two continents would have recognized them. They passed through the house to the professor's laboratory at the rear. A long time passed. The reporter fidgeted nervously. Some conference of colossal importance was taking place back there in the laboratory.  It was an hour later that the visitors left. With them went a young man the reporter had not seen before. The professor came slowly into the room and smiled apologetically.  \"I am very sorry to have kept you waiting, but it was necessary. I think that in about two hours I will have some news for you. In the meantime there is nothing more to say.\"  \"Can you tell me what really happened? How did this Varrhus make the berg?\"  \"It's the simplest thing in the world,\" said the professor with a smile. \"I've managed to duplicate it on a small scale back in my laboratory. Suppose you come back there and I'll show you.\"  A girl appeared in the doorway with a worried frown on her face.  \"Father, has Teddy gone?\"  \"Yes. We'll hear in about two hours.\" The professor turned to the reporter with instinctive courtesy. \"This is my daughter, Evelyn.\"  The girl shook hands.  \"You want to know about the iceberg, too? Teddy has gone to break it up now.\"  \"To try to break it up,\" corrected the professor with a smile. \"'Teddy' is my assistant.\"  \"But how?\" insisted the reporter. \"You seem to be so confident, and every one else does nothing but guess.\"  \"I'll show you quite clearly,\" the professor said gently, \"if you'll come back to the laboratory.\"  They moved toward the rear of the house. A hullabaloo of whistles broke out in the harbor. The girl turned toward the professor.  \"Teddy already?\"  The professor frowned.  \"He hasn't had time.\" He went to a window and looked out, inspecting the sky keenly. A slender black splinter hung suspended in the air. The professor flung open the window, and a musical humming filled the room. As they watched a smoking object detached itself from the black flyer and fell downward.  \"That must be Varrhus,\" said the professor.  A winged flyer with the insignia of the American aviation corps painted on the under surface of its wings darted into their field of vision. Black smoke trailed behind it as it shot toward the sinister black craft. There was an instant's pause, and then little puffs of white mist appeared before the propeller of the aÃ«roplane.  \"He's firing his machine gun!\" said the reporter excitedly.  As he spoke the black flyer dropped like a stone, and the American plane shot above it. Almost instantly the black flyer checked in mid-air and rose vertically with amazing speed. The American plane drove on for a second, and then wavered. It began to climb, stalled, and dropped toward the earth in a series of side slips and maple-leaf turns. It came down erratically, crazily.  \"Killed!\" said the professor with compressed lips.  His daughter uttered a cry:  \"And Varrhus is getting away!\"  The black flyer had become but the merest speck. It had attained an almost unbelievable height. Now it deliberately swung around and headed off toward the northeast with its same incredible speed.     CHAPTER III.   Teddy Gerrod was stuffing his feet into heavy, fur-lined arctic boots. Ten or twelve soldiers were loading clumsy, awkward-looking engines on improvised sledges resting on the ice at the foot of the fort embankments. Others were putting equally ungainly iron globes with winged metal rods attached to them on other sledges. A dozen befurred and swathed figures came down the slope of the embankment and examined the preparations. A naval launch ran smartly alongside the edge of the ice, and a messenger came over at the double to the commandant of the fort, who stood by Teddy Gerrod. The messenger saluted.  \"Sir, the object dropped from the black flyer was a tin float having a message attached. The smoke was from a smoke fuse, lighted to attract attention.\"  He handed over the letter, saluted again, and retired. The commandant tore open the letter and read it through, then swore frankly.  \"A threat to freeze the Croton reservoir and cut off New York City's water supply if an answer to his previous demands is not given within forty-eight hours! And he can do it! Mr. Gerrod, you've simply got to settle this business. New York would go crazy if the people knew this. There'd be no way to supply the water the city has to have. And seven million people without water----\"  Teddy smiled grimly.  \"I'm going to try. Professor Hawkins is usually right, and we ought to be able to do something about this berg.\"  A second messenger came up and saluted.  \"Sir, Lieutenant Davis reports that the plane has been recovered and Lieutenant Curtiss' body examined. There are no bullet marks, and the body seemed to be frozen solidly. He cannot say, as yet, what caused Lieutenant Curtiss' death.\"  \"Frozen,\" said Teddy laconically.  \"In mid-air?\" asked the commandant sharply. \"And in a fraction of a second, wearing heavy aviator's clothing?\"  Teddy nodded, and buttoned up the huge fur coat in which he was enveloped.  \"I'm ready to start off now, if the sledges are.\"  The little party moved away from the shore. The heavy mist still hung over the expanse of ice, but near the shore the ice was thinner. The sledges were roped together, and Teddy walked at the head. The party tugged at the ropes on the sledges, puffing out clouds of frosty breath at every exhalation. Teddy had taken the compass bearings of the steam plume, and after he had gone a hundred yards from the shore the wisdom of his course became apparent. They were completely surrounded by a thick fog in which objects five yards off were lost to view. Teddy, leading the small column, could not be seen except as a dim and shadowy figure by the men hardly more than two paces in his rear. He referred constantly to his compass, and once or twice glanced at the thermometer he had strapped on the sleeve of his great coat.  \"Forty degrees,\" he murmured to himself. \"And in New York it's eighty-four in the shade. The ice must be colder still because it's dry and hard.\"  The party toiled on. Presently small snow crystals crunched underfoot.  \"Frozen mist,\" said Teddy, and glanced at his thermometer. \"H'm! Twenty-two degrees. Ten below freezing.\"  The party stopped for a breathing spell.  \"I hope you men smoke,\" said Teddy, \"because it's going to be cold a few hundred yards farther on. We'll come clear of this mist presently. If you smoke, and inhale, it'll probably warm up your lungs a little. You don't need it yet, though. Any of you who haven't pulled down the flaps of your helmets had better do so now.\"  A moment or so later they took up their march again. The sledges, with their heavy loads, were cumbersome things to drag over the uneven surface of the ice. The men panted and gasped as they threw their weight on the ropes. Teddy felt the air growing colder still, and presently noticed that the mist no longer seemed to be as thick as before. He glanced down at the front of his heavy fur coat. It was covered with tiny white crystals. He held up his hand with the thick mitten on it to form a dark background, and saw numberless infinitesimal snowflakes drifting slowly toward the ice under his feet. His thermometer showed two degrees above zero--and New York, six miles away, was sweltering in August heat!  \"Not much farther,\" he called cheerfully. \"We're almost there.\"  They panted and tugged on, a hundred and fifty yards more. Then they stopped and stared.  Three hundred yards away the great column of steam was issuing from the ice. A hollow hillock of snow and ice rose to a height of twenty feet, like the miniature crater of a volcano. From it, in an unbroken stream, the mass of steam emerged with a roaring, rushing sound. It rose five hundred feet before it broke into the plumelike formation that was so characteristic. There was a space, perhaps six hundred paces across, in which there was no mist. The cold was too intense to allow of the formation of fog. Water vapor condensed instantly in that frigid atmosphere. But around the clearing the mist rose from the surface of the ice. It became noticeable when it was merely waist-high, then rose to the height of a man, and climbed to a height of fifty feet in a circular wall all about the strange white open space. Teddy, looking at the top of the wall of vapor, saw that it undulated gently, as if waves were flowing back and forth around the tall column of steam.  The men began to unload their sledges. The awkward little trench mortars were set in place and careful measurements made of the distance to the steam plume. While the men labored, Teddy moved forward toward the central cone. Five degrees below zero, fifteen degrees below zero, thirty degrees below zero----His breath cut sharply when it went into his lungs. Teddy put his mittened hand over his nose and face to partially warm the air before he breathed it in. Now, even through the heavy, arctic clothing he wore, he felt the bitter cold. He detached the thermometer from his sleeve and clumsily tied it to a cord. He had hoped to be able to lower it down the rim of the crater, but that was impossible. He flung it toward the hillock of snow and ice, let it remain there an instant, then hastily"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50585"],["title","A Thousand Degrees Below Zero (#3)"],["body","it back to read it. The ether in the thermometer had frozen into a solid mass in the bulb of the instrument.  Teddy went back to where the men had made ready. Four of the wicked little guns would fling their three-hundred-pound bombs into the center of the column of steam. If all went well, at least one charge of T.N.T. would explode far down the orifice.  The propelling charges had been inserted, and now the slender rods were put into the muzzles of the short, squat weapons. The winged bombs were balanced on the muzzles like top-heavy oranges on as many sticks. At half-second intervals, the four guns went off one after the other.  Before the last had exploded, or just as the flame leaped from its muzzle, the hillock of ice rose as in an eruption. Four cracking detonations blended into one colossal roar that half stunned the little fur-clad party. The rush of air threw them from their feet. When they rose again a huge hole showed in the center of the clearing, a gaping chasm that went down deep into the heart of the ice. A cloud of yellowish smoke floated above them. And the column of steam had ceased! Only a few stray wisps of white vapor floated up from the opening.  \"It's done!\"  Teddy gave orders for a quick return to the fort. The mortars could be returned for. At the moment the important thing was to send the news to England and Japan.  The return trip was made quickly, and Teddy made hurried explanations to the commandant of the forts of what should be done. Men should bore deep holes twenty feet apart, the holes to be along the edges of clearly defined sections of the ice. Simultaneous blasts should be set off, and the sections would float free. The iceberg would not grow again. It was done for.  Cablegrams were prepared and rushed through to Folkestone, Yokohama, and Gibraltar. If men took trench mortars and fired shells that would fall down the holes from which the steam issued, the cause of the ice cakes would be destroyed and the ice itself could be blasted off and towed out to sea to melt.  Teddy rushed back to the professor's home to report to him the full verification of his theories, and it was there and then that the first authentic explanation of the ice floe was given to the world. Word of his effort and of the disappearance of the steam plume had preceded him, and as he sped uptown in the taxicab newsboys were already on the streets with their extras. Only the front pages--showing signs of having hastily been hacked to pieces to make room for the story--had anything about the latest development, and those extras are singularly perfect reflections of the public attitude at that time.     CHAPTER IV.   Teddy threw himself out of the machine and rushed up the steps. Evelyn opened the door before he could ring, and his beaming face told her the news he had to give even without his enthusiastic, \"It worked!\"  \"The steam plume has stopped?\" asked the professor anxiously.  \"Absolutely,\" said Teddy cheerfully. \"Not a sign of steam except from two or three puddles of hot water that were cooling off when we left to get back to the fort. The commandant was setting his men to work with the navy-yard men when I started here.\"  \"Tell me about this, won't you?\" said the reporter briskly. \"I'll catch the devil from the city editor for missing out on that part of it, but if you'll give me the full story----\"  \"What's your paper?\"  The reporter told him.  \"That's all right,\" said Teddy easily. \"They were calling extras of that paper as I came uptown. The professor has told you the theory of the thing?\"  \"No,\" said Evelyn. \"He was starting to, but the black flyer appeared and shot down the other aÃ«roplane, and father was so much upset that he couldn't go into details. Was the pilot of the aÃ«roplane killed?\"  Teddy nodded.  \"Frozen, poor chap. He never knew what struck him.\"  \"What did happen?\" asked the reporter again. \"You people seem to take this so much as a matter of course, and no one else can do anything but guess.\"  \"The professor knows more about low temperatures than any other man in the world,\" explained Teddy. \"It's only natural that he should be fairly certain of his facts.\"  He smiled at the professor as the old man made a deprecating gesture.  \"Father is much upset,\" said Evelyn. \"I think it would be best if Teddy explained. Will that be all right?\"  \"Only, in your account of the matter,\" said Teddy decidedly, \"the professor must be given credit for the whole thing. It's his work, and he's entitled to it.\"  \"No, no,\" protested the professor. \"Teddy did a great deal.\"  Evelyn pressed his arm, and he obediently was quiet. The two young people smiled at him.  \"You see how I am ruled,\" said the professor in mock tragedy. \"My daughter----\"  \"Is going to see that you rest a while,\" said Evelyn, with a twinkle in her eyes. \"Teddy, you go and explain the whole thing while I take father out and discipline him.\"  With a laugh, she led the old man away. Teddy smiled.  \"We aren't accustomed to reporters,\" he said, \"or I suspect we'd act differently. Miss Hawkins is a most capable physicist, and helps her father immensely. The three of us work together so much that----Well, come along to the laboratory.\"  The two went to the rear of the house. On the way they passed through a long room full of glass cabinets in which odd bits of metal work glittered brightly.  \"The professor's hobby,\" said Teddy, with a nod toward the cases. \"Antique jewelry and ancient metal work. He's probably better informed on low temperatures than any one else I know of, but I really believe he's as much of an authority on that, too. This is Phoenician, and that's early Greek. These are Egyptian in this case. This way.\"  He opened a small door and they were in the laboratory.  \"I'm afraid I'll have to lecture a bit,\" said Teddy. \"Here's how the professor used to work out what was taking place out in the harbor.\"  He showed an intricate combination of silvered globes, tubes, and half a dozen thermometers.  \"You see,\" Teddy began, \"the water in the harbor was at a certain temperature. At this time of the year it would be around 52Â° Fahrenheit. The professor knew that fact, and then the fact that a huge mass of it was turned into ice. When you turn water into ice you have to take a lot of heat out of it, and that heat has to go somewhere. When water freezes normally in winter that heat goes into the air, which is cold. In this case the air was considerably warmer than the ice, and was as a matter of fact, undoubtedly radiating heat into the ice, instead of taking it away. The heat that would have to be taken from say ten pounds of water at 52Â° to make it freeze, if put into another smaller quantity of water would turn the smaller quantity of water into steam. You see?\"  \"The steam plume!\" exclaimed the reporter.  \"Of course,\" said Teddy. \"We measure heat by calories usually. That's the amount of heat required to raise a pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. Suppose you have a mass of water. To make it freeze you have to take twenty thousand calories of heat out of it. Suppose you take that heat out. You've got to do something with it. Suppose you put it into another smaller mass of water. It will make that second mass of water hot, so hot that it will turn into steam at a high temperature.\"  \"Then Varrhus,\" said the reporter thoughtfully, \"was taking the heat from a big bunch of water and putting it into a small bunch, and the small bunch went up in steam. Is that right?\"  \"Precisely.\" Teddy turned to a file on which hung a number of sheets of paper covered with figures. \"Here are the professor's calculations. We could only figure approximately, but we knew the size and depth of the ice cake, very nearly the temperature of the water that had been frozen, and naturally it was not hard to estimate the number of calories that had had to be taken out of the harbor water to make the ice cake. To check up, we figured out how much water that number of calories would turn into steam. The professor appealed to the government scientists who had watched the cake from the first. He found that from the size of the plume and the other means of checking its volume, he had come within ten per cent of calculating the amount of water that had actually poured out in the shape of steam.\"  \"But--but that's amazing!\" said the reporter.  \"It was good work,\" Teddy said in some satisfaction. \"Then we knew what Varrhus had done, and it remained to find out how he'd done it. Nothing like that had ever happened before. He couldn't very well have an engine working there in the water. The professor took to his mathematics again. Assume that I have a stove here that will make it just so warm at a distance of five feet. I'm leaving warm air out of consideration now and only thinking of radiated heat. If I put my thermometer ten feet away how much heat will I get?\"  \"Half as much?\" asked the reporter.  \"One-quarter as much,\" said Teddy. \"Or three times away I'll get one-ninth as much, or four times away I'll get one-sixteenth as much. You see? If I want to make the ends of an iron bar hot, and I can only heat the middle, the middle has to be red-hot or white-hot to make the ends even warm. If I have to make the middle of a bar red-hot to have the ends warm, you see in order to make the ends cold the middle would have to be very cold indeed.\"  \"Y-yes, I understand.\"  \"Well, the professor worked on that principle. He knew the temperature of the edges, and he knew the size of the ice cake. It was easy to figure what the temperature must be in the middle. It worked out to within two degrees of absolute zero!\"  \"What's that?\"  \"There isn't any limit to high temperatures. You can go up two thousand degrees, three thousand, four, or five. Some things almost certainly produce a temperature of as much as eight thousand degrees. But high temperatures are produced by putting more heat in--by stuffing the thing with calories. I make an iron bar red-hot by putting calories in. I"]]]
