He had no use for the giddy, half-hysterical people who crowded these smoke-filled holes night after night. They came in droves from the heart of the city to drink the watery gin and puff frantically on the contraband cigarettes as they tried desperately to drive off the steam and pressure of their daily lives.  Meyer hated the smell and stuffiness of the place; he hated the loud screams of laughter, the idiotic giggles; he hated the blubbering alky-sikys who crowded the bars with their whisky and their strange, unearthly dream-worlds. Above all, he hated the horrible, resounding artificiality, the brassiness and clanging noise of the crowd. His skin crawled. He knew that he couldn't possibly disappear into such a crowd, that he was as obvious, sitting there, as if he had been painted with red polka dots. And he knew that if Conroe spotted him a second before he spotted Conroe--He eased back in the chair and fought for control of his trembling hands.  The lights dimmed suddenly and a huge red spotlight caught the curtain at the back of the show floor. Jeff heard Bahr catch his breath for a moment, then let out a small, uneasy sigh. The crowd hushed as the girl parted the curtains and stepped out onto the middle of the floor, to a fanfare of tinny music. Jeff's eyes widened as they followed her to the center of the red light.  \"That's her.\"  Jeff glanced sharply at Bahr. \"The girl? She's the one?\"  Bahr nodded. \"Conroe knows how to pick them. He's supposed to meet her later. This is her first show for the evening. Then she has another at ten and another at two. He's supposed to take her home.\" He glanced around the room carefully. \"Watch yourself,\" he muttered, and silently slipped away from the table.  The girl was nervous. Jeff sat close enough to see the fear in her face as she whirled around the floor. The music had shifted into a slow throbbing undertone, as she started to dance. She moved slowly, circling the floor. Her hair was long and black, flowing around her shoulders, and her body moved with carefully calculated grace to the music. But there was fear in her face as she whirled, and her eyes sought the faces on the fringe of the circle.  The music quickened imperceptibly and Jeff felt a chill run up his spine. The upper part of the shimmering gown slipped from the girl's shoulders, and slowly the tempo of the dance began to change from the stately rhythm it had a moment before. The throb of the music became hypnotic, moving faster and faster. Jeff's hands trembled as he tried to draw his eyes away from the undulating figure. There had been nothing to mark the change, but suddenly the dance had become obscene as the music rose--so viciously obscene that Jeff nearly gagged.  He felt the tension in the crowd around him. He heard their breathing rise, felt the desperate eagerness in their hard, bright eyes as they watched. The nervousness had left the girl's face. She had forgotten her fear, and a little smile appeared on her face as her body moved in abandon to the quickening beat.  Slowly she moved toward the tables, and the spotlight followed her, playing tricks with her hair and gown, concealing and revealing, twisting and swaying.... Jeff felt his body freeze. He fought to move, fought to take his eyes from the writhing figure as she drew closer and closer--  And then she was among the people, moving from table to table, never slowing her motion, graceful as a cat, twisting and twirling in the flickering red light. In and out she moved until she reached Jeff's table, her face inscrutable--a peacefully smiling mask. With amazing grace she leaped up on the table top and gave Jeff's glass a kick that sent it spinning onto the floor with a crash. And then the red light hit him full in the face--  \"Get out of the light!\"  Like a cat he threw his chair back and struck the girl, knocking her from the table. Someone screamed and the light swung to the girl, then back to him. The table went over. He rolled out of the light, twisting and fighting through the stunned and screaming crowd. His gun was in his hand, and he frantically searched the shouting room with his eyes.  \"Get him! There he goes!\"  He heard Bahr's voice roar from the side of the room. Jeff swung sharply to the sound of the voice. He saw the tall, slender figure crouched with his back to the bar, eyes wide with fear and desperation. There was no mistaking the face, the hollow cheeks and the high forehead, the graying hair. It was the face he had seen in his dreams, the twisted lips, the evil, ghoulish face of the man he had hunted to the ends of the earth. For a fraction of a second he saw Paul Conroe, crouched at bay, and then the figure was gone, twisting through the crowd toward the door--  \"Stop him!\" Jeff swung savagely into the crowd, screaming at Bahr across the room. \"He's heading for the street! Get him!\" The gun kicked sharply against his hand as he fired at the moving head. Rising for an instant, it disappeared again into the sea of heads. A scream rose at the shot. Women dropped to the floor, glasses crashed, tables went over. Someone clawed ineffectually for Jeff's leg. Then, abruptly, the lights went out and there was another scream.  \"The door, the door--Don't let him get out--\"  Jeff plunged to the side of the room, wrenched open the emergency exit and plunged down the dark, narrow walkway to the street. He heard shots as he ran. Turning the corner of the building, he saw the tall figure running pell-mell down the wet street.  \"There he goes! Get him!\"  Ted Bahr hung from the door. He gasped as he held his side, his face twisted in pain. \"He hit me,\" he panted. \"He's broken away--\" A jet car slid from the curb and whined down the street toward the fleeing figure. \"He can't make it--I've got men on every corner in cars. They'll get him, drive him back--\"  \"But where's he going?\" A sob of rage choked Jeff's voice. \"She sold us out, the bitch. She fingered me when she saw him come in--\" His whole body trembled and the words tumbled out, almost incoherent. \"But he must know the streets are blocked. Where's he running?\"  \"You think I'm a mind reader? I don't know. There are no open buildings in the whole block but this place and the Hoffman Center. He can't go anywhere else and he can't get out of the block. We've got every escapeway sewed up tight. He'll have to come back here or be shot down out there.\"  They watched the gloomy street, tears of rage in Jeff's eyes. His hands shook uncontrollably and his shoulders sagged in exhaustion and defeat. The tavern door had burst open and people were crowding out. Jeff and Ted Bahr moved back into the shadows of the alleyway and waited and listened.  \"There's got to be a shot!\" Jeff burst out. \"He couldn't have slipped through.\" He turned to Bahr frantically. \"Could he have gone into the Center?\"  \"On what pretense? They'd throw him to the Mercy Men--or the booby hatch, one or the other. He'd know better than to try.\" The sandy-haired man sank down on his haunches and gripped his side tightly. \"He'll be back or we'll hear the shooting. He couldn't have slipped through.\"  A three-wheeled jet car slid in to the curb, and a man came up to them, eyes wide. \"Get him?\"  Bahr scowled. \"No sign. How about the other boys?\"  The man blinked. \"Not a whisper. He never reached the end of the block.\"  \"Did you check with Klett and Barker?\"  \"They haven't seen a soul down here.\"  Bahr glanced at Jeff sharply. \"How about the streets behind? Any chance of a breakthrough there?\"  The man's voice was matter-of-fact. \"It's airtight. He couldn't get through without somebody seeing him.\" He stepped back to the car and spoke rapidly into the talker for a moment or two. \"Nothing yet.\"  \"Damn. How about Howie and the boys inside the place?\"  \"Nothing from them either.\"  Jeff's face darkened. \"The Hoffman Center,\" he said slowly. \"He got into the Center, somehow. He must have.\"  \"He'd have to have gilt-edged medical credentials to get in after hours. They don't mess around over there. And what would it gain him?\"  Jeff peered at Bahr in the darkness. \"Maybe he wanted to be thrown to the Mercy Men. Maybe he's figured that as a last resort, he'll go in and volunteer, make a stab at the Big Cash.\"  Bahr stared at the big man in horror. \"Look--Conroe may be desperate, but he hasn't lost his mind. My God, man! He isn't crazy.\"  \"But he's scared.\"  \"Of course he's scared, but--\"  \"How scared?\"  Bahr shrugged angrily. \"He'd have to be on his last legs to take a gamble like that.\"  \"But they'd take him. They wouldn't ask any questions. They'd swallow him up; _they'd hide him_, whether they knew it or not.\" Jeff's voice rose in excitement. \"Look. We've hunted him down for years. We've never rested; we've never quit. He knows that and he knows why. He knows me. He knows I'm not going to quit until I get him. And he knows I will get him, sooner or later. I'm cutting too close; I'm undermining his friends; I'm always moving closer. Everywhere he goes, everything he does, I'm onto him. And he knows when I do get him, he's going to die. What does that add up to?\"  Bahr blinked in silence. Jeff's face hardened. \"Well, I'll tell you what it adds up to. A man can take just so much. He can slide and twist and hide and keep moving just so long. Then he finds there aren't any more hiding places. But there's one last place a man can go to hide--if he's really at the end of his tether--and that's the Mercy Men. Because there he could vanish as though he'd never existed.\"  Ted Bahr carefully lit a smoke. \"If that's where he went, we're through, Jeff. We'll never get him. We don't even need to worry about trying. Because if he's gone there, he'll never come out again.\"  \"Some of them do.\"  Bahr grunted. \"One in a million, maybe. The odds are so heavy that there's no sense thinking about it. If Paul Conroe has gone to the Mercy Men, then he's dead. And that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49531"],["title","A Man Obsessed (#2)"],["body","that.\"  Jeff returned his weapon to his pocket sharply and walked out to the car at the curb. \"Keep your men where they are,\" he said to Bahr. \"Keep them there for the rest of the night. If he's found a loophole, I want to know it. If he's hidden in the buildings, he'll have to come out sometime. Get some men to search the roofs, and you and I can start on the alleyways. If he's out there, we'll get him.\" He straightened his shoulders and the sullen fire was back in his eyes--an angry, bitter fire. \"And if he's gone into the Center, we'll still get him.\"  Bahr's eyes were wide. \"He'll never come out if he's gone where you think, Jeff. We could wait weeks or months, even years, and we still wouldn't know. Even if he did come out, we might never recognize him.\"  \"I'll recognize him,\" Jeff snarled, looking down into Bahr's face. \"I'm going to kill him. I'm going to know that he's dead, because I'll see him die. And I'll kill him if I have to follow him into the Center to do it.\"     CHAPTER TWO   The news report blatted in Jeff Meyer's ear from the little car radio. The words came through, but he hardly heard them as his eyes watched the huge glass doors of the administration building of the Hoffman Medical Center.    ... no word has yet been received, but it is believed that the   Eurasian governments may be in session several hours more in an   attempt to stem the inflation. On the home front, the stock-market   nosedive, which resulted from the new Senate taxation bill yesterday,   leveled off when the Secretary of Corporative Business announced this   morning that the government would abandon attempts to enforce the new   law, at least for the time being. Secretary Barnes stated that further   study of the bill would be undertaken when more pressing governmental   problems had been cleared--  Jeff snapped off the switch with a snarl. The street passing the Center was crowded. Lines of cars moved into and out of the traffic stream from the huge Center parking tiers. The building rose high, tier upon tier. Its walls gleamed white in the bright morning sunlight, reflecting brilliant facets of golden light from thousands of polished windows.  It was an immense building, sprawling across six perfectly landscaped city blocks, tall trees and cool green terraces setting off the glistening beauty of the architecture. The structure sent tower after tower up from the dingy street below, and at the foot of the towers was a buzz of furious activity. Supply trucks, carrying food and supplies for the twenty-two thousand beds and the people in them, and for the additional thirteen thousand people who worked day and night to keep the huge hospital running, moved toward the unloading platforms.  The Hoffman Medical Center was an age-old dream which had finally come true. Even those who had conceived it had not realized the tremendous need it would fulfill. From its very inception, no expense had been spared. The finest architects had thrown up the shimmering ward-towers, turned toward the sun, to bring light to the sick and injured who rested and healed within. Equipment unequaled anywhere in the world had filled the Center's dressing and surgical rooms. The doctors, nurses, researchers and technicians who staffed the institution had been gathered from the world over. And all the world had conceded the Hoffman Center its place as leader in the realm of medicine, ever since the cornerstone had been laid that rainy morning in the spring of the year 2085. Twenty-four years had passed since that day, and in those years the Hoffman Center had never once faltered in its leadership.  The men in the car sat in stony silence. Finally, Jeff Meyer stirred, extended his hand briefly to Ted Bahr. \"You'll cover things out here?\"  \"Don't worry about it.\" Bahr shook the hand. \"Well wait to hear from you.\" He watched, almost wistfully, as the huge man cut through the traffic and headed for the large glass doors. Then, with a sigh, he stepped on the starter button and snaked the little jet car into the stream of traffic moving toward the city.         *       *       *       *       *  Jeff Meyer stopped in the great, bustling lobby and stared about him almost in awe. He had never been inside the Hoffman Center before, though he had heard of it many times and in many places. Since it had taken over service of the huge metropolis of Boston-New Haven-New York-Philadelphia, the newspapers and TV had been full of stories of the lifesaving and healing that had gone on within its walls. The disease research, conducted by specialists in all phases of medicine who were for the first time gathered together under one agency, had startled the world again and again.  But there had been other stories, too--not from the papers and TV, not these stories. These tales had come by word of mouth: a short sentence or two, a nervous laugh, a sneering joke, a rumor, a whispered story from a wide-eyed alky hanging over a bar. Not the sort of stories one really believed, but the sort that made one wonder.  Several dozen white-garbed women moved across the floor of the huge lobby and talked quietly among themselves. Jeff sniffed uneasily. There was a curiously distasteful odor in the air, an odor of almost unhealthy cleanliness and spotless preservation. The lobby was a mill of activity: the elevators and interbuilding jitneys terminated here; people moved briskly, carrying with them the familiar air of hurry and vast pressure that infected the whole world outside.  Jeff watched, spotting the corridor leading to the main administrative offices. He saw the elevators constantly rising to and returning from the huge admission offices. He noted the corridor twisting off to the staff living quarters. He stood silent, his quick gray eyes cautiously probing and watching. He tried to print an indelible picture in his mind of the layout of the building and was almost floored by the hive-like bustle of the place. There was a complexity in the curved doorways and the brightly lighted corridors.  Somewhere here he could find Paul Conroe. Somewhere in this maze of buildings and passageways was the man he had hunted for. Logic told him that. They had spent the night searching every possible alternative. His muscles ached and his eyes were red from sleeplessness, but there was a hot, angry glow in his heart. He knew that this was the only place that Conroe could have gone. Yet the place where he must be hiding was a place Jeff had heard of only in rumor, a place whose mention carried with it a half-knowledge of staggering wealth and almost indescribable horror.  Someone tapped him on the shoulder. He turned, startled, to face a huge, burly man with a suspicious face and a gray uniform. \"You got business here, mister, or are we just sight-seeing?\"  Jeff forced a grin. \"I don't know where to go,\" he said truthfully.  \"Maybe you should go back out then. No visitors until this afternoon.\"  \"No, I'm not a visitor. I'm looking for the Volunteer's Bank. The ads said to come to the administration offices--\"  The guard's face softened a little. He pointed a finger toward a corridor marked RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION. \"Right over there,\" he said. \"Office is the first door to your right. The nurse will take care of you.\"  Meyer strolled toward the corridor, his mind fumbling with the rumors and bits of half-knowledge that were all that he had to work on: stories of drunks stumbling into the Emergency Rooms and never coming out; tales of quiet, swift raids on narcotics houses, of people who never reached the police stations.  But how could he make the right contact here? \"Research Administration\" covered a multitude of meanings. He had read the advertisements for Hoffman volunteers in all the buses, in the 'copters, on the roads. Newspapers and TV had carried them for years. Meyer glanced down at his unpolished shoes, rubbed a finger over his purposely unshaven chin. What would they expect a volunteer to look like? How could they detect a fraud, an interloper? He shivered as he faced the office door. It would be a gamble, a terrible chance. Because with all the other publicity, no mention had ever been made of the Mercy Men. He glanced back, found the guard still staring at him, and walked into the office.  Several people sat along the wall. A small, mousy-looking man with a bald head and close-set eyes had just sat down in the chair before the desk. He waited for the prim-looking woman wearing a ridiculous little white hat to put down her pen. She didn't even glance up as Jeff took a seat, and she kept writing for several minutes before turning her attention to the little bald man. Then she looked up and gave a frosty smile at him. \"Yes, sir?\"  \"Dr. Bennet asked me to come back today,\" the little man said. \"Follow-up on last week's work.\"  \"Name please?\" The woman took his name and punched the button on a panel before her; an instant later a card flipped down in a slot. She checked it, made an entry and nodded to the man. \"Dr. Bennet will be ready for you at eleven. You'll find magazines in the lounge.\" She indicated another door, and the little man disappeared through it.  Another person, a middle-aged woman, moved to take the little man's place before the desk. Jeff felt restless and glanced at his watch. It was almost eleven. Must she move so slowly? Nothing seemed to hurry her. She worked from person to person, smiling, impersonal, just a trifle chilly. Finally she nodded to Jeff, and he moved to the chair.  \"Name, please?\"  \"You don't have a card on me.\"  She looked up briefly. \"A new volunteer? We're happy to have you, sir. Now if you'll give me your name, I can start the papers through.\"  Jeff cleared his throat, felt his pulse pounding in his forehead. \"I'm not sure just what I want to volunteer for,\" he said cautiously.  The woman smiled. \"We have a rather large selection to choose from. There are the regular 'mycin drug runs every week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You take the drug by"]]]
