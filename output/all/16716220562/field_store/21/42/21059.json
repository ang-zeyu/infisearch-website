All was quiet, no noise, not even the ticking of a clock, could be heard. There was no light save the glimmer of the gas from the passage way outside the cell.  We were alone and felt sad and rather low-spirited. We conversed but little. I walked up and down the cell; Richard laid down and tried to sleep. This was a hard thing for him to do, as his thoughts troubled him. Oh, how I lifted my heart heavenward and prayed most fervently to my Heavenly Father to comfort us in our hour of trial! Presently I heard footsteps, and a voice at the door asked:  \"Do you want anything, mates?\"  I answered, \"No.\"  Poor fellow! It was one of the keepers. They evidently felt for us, for they came two or three times and asked the same question. Then I laid down and tried to sleep, but could not.  We had been in the cell perhaps two hours, when a heavenly influence rested upon us. I said to Richard:  \"How do you feel?\"  He replied, \"I feel happy.\"  I told him I never felt so happy in all my life as at that moment, and remarked I did not care how long we remained in the cell if we could feel like that all the time.  It was the holy influence of the Spirit of the Lord that rested upon us. To us it was a testimony that the gospel we had embraced was true. Our minds became calm and we were strengthened in that hour of trial. At last sleep closed our eyes. Thus ended a very eventful day of our lives.  About half-past 5 next morning our breakfast was handed to us through the small, square hole in the door--bread and butter and coffee. We tasted the coffee, but did not like it; so I asked the keeper to give us some water, which he did.  About 6 o'clock, the cell door was opened and there stood before us an officer from Middlesbrough, a gentleman whom we had seen before. He produced a pair of handcuffs and put them on our wrists. This indignity we felt most keenly. My wrists were so thin the handcuffs were almost too large and they nearly slipped over my hand. He told us to follow him, which we did, and as we passed through the police office, we bade the keepers good-by. Their kindness towards us is still treasured up by me, and if ever the pleasure of meeting them again presents itself, it will be a source of happiness to shake them by the hand and thank them for past favors.  A hack was waiting in front of the office, which we got into and started for the railway which would take us to Middlesbrough.  A little while after the train had started the handcuffs were removed from our wrists. To pass the time away we amused ourselves looking out of the car windows and viewing passing objects and did all we could to make them think we did not care for being taken back to our homes; but could the secrets of our bosoms have been revealed, two aching hearts would have been discovered.  Before the train reached its destination the \"bracelets\" were again placed on our hands. We arrived at Middlesbrough about a quarter to 8 in the evening. Before getting out of the cars we pulled our coat sleeves over the handcuffs, and as soon as we were out in the station, we swung our hands, kept a smile on our countenances and were scarcely noticed by anyone, till we arrived at the Middlesbrough police office. No sooner had we entered the office than one of the officers in charge inquired:  \"Are you the boys that have been brought back?\"  I answered, \"Yes.\"  He said, \"You were not worth bringing back,\" which sentiment found an echo in my own heart.    CHAPTER VIII.  IN THE CELL--A VISIT FROM RICHARD'S FATHER AND MY MOTHER--THE TRIAL--THE DECISION OF THE COURT--A FEW WORDS OF EXPLANATION.  We were soon escorted to a cell, which was much larger and colder than the one we occupied the night previous. The handcuffs taken off, the door closed upon us, and with sad hearts we sat down upon a bed of straw.  We had been in the cell but a few minutes when Richard's father came with some supper for his son. How sad he looked as he entered the cell--a father's love for his boy was clearly manifest. He did not say much, but looked hard at me, as though he blamed me for leading him from home. Of course I was a few months older than Richard, but he was taller and stouter than I, and to look at us it would hardly appear reasonable that I should have power to lead him away. Mr. Sedgwick only stayed a few moments.  The supper was soon spread. Richard, poor fellow, could not eat, but I did justice to my share. We then laid down and tried to sleep, but what with the mice and other small visitors, and thinking of our peculiar situation, we had little sleep that night, and were not sorry when daylight came.  About 8 o'clock the next morning my mother entered the cell with some breakfast for me. She did not say much but evidently felt for me. It was principally through her we had been brought back. Though one of the prime movers in our capture, she was hardly to blame, for she believed it was her duty to do what she had done. So many tales had been told her concerning Utah and the \"Mormons\" that she felt positive there must be a great deal of truth in them.  About half-past 10 o'clock we were escorted into a room where an officer took a description of us--color of our hair, eyes, complexion, our height, etc. Shortly afterwards we were taken into the court room and had our trial before Judge Fallows. Besides the judge and several policemen, our employers, Richard's father and my mother were there.  The judge asked a few questions and then inquired what we had to say for ourselves. I immediately arose and said:  \"What I have to say for myself is this: The room I work in is not a fit place, as it is a cold, damp cellar.\"  Mr. Gould denied this statement.  The judge then asked Richard what he had to say for himself. He replied that his reason for absconding was because we were such close companions, and when I ran away he followed me. One of the police said to me:  \"You're the leader, then, are you?\"  We were then asked by the judge whether we would serve the remainder of our apprenticeship in jail, or go back and work for our employers. We chose the latter alternative.  He then inquired of Mr. Carter what our expenses were and the amount of our passage money. On being informed, he decided that if our employers could obtain the money for our ship tickets it would clear the incurred expenses; but if not, the expenses were to be deducted out of our wages, and the case was dismissed. At this we were not sorry. I went home; but as my parents were not there I went to see Wm. H. Scott.  Before proceeding further, it may be proper to offer a few words concerning our capture. When we did not return to our homes at the time appointed, suspicion was immediately aroused and Mr. Carter told Mr. Gould and our parents he believed we were connected with the \"Mormons,\" and had run away with the intention of going by a vessel that was to sail for America. They at once telegraphed to London to see if the ship had started and were informed it had not.  Our parents were anxious we should be brought back, and my mother begged they would send for us. She said she would do anything rather than have us go to Utah with the \"Mormons.\" Mr. Gould was not much in favor of taking any steps; but Mr. Carter felt quite interested in the matter. He telegraphed to London and had a detective put on our track, and started himself for London that evening and arrived there early next morning, when, accompanied by a detective, he took us off the ship as already narrated.  To again continue the story. I spent the Saturday afternoon after our trial with Wm. H. Scott, who had not yet gone on his mission. He informed us that while we were absent he had had an unpleasant time. Both our parents and employers had suspected him of being the cause of our absconding, and not seeing him in Middlesbrough, they thought he had gone with us; but in this they were mistaken, as William, thinking they would suspect him, went to Stockton and stayed there a few days. After this interview I went home and was treated very kindly by my parents that evening.    CHAPTER IX.  A CLIPPING FROM THE \"MIDDLESBROUGH NEWS\"--A PROMISE MADE BUT NOT FULFILLED--THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO LEAVE HOME.  After my return home I thought seriously over the matter of absconding. I knew I had broken the law and also the promise I had made in my indentures to work seven years with Mr. Gould. Had my parents been more favorable towards me, I should not have left my home and employer to endeavor to emigrate with the Saints until I was free to act upon my own responsibility, and to do as I thought best. But now that I was back again, it was my resolve to stay and finish the remainder of my apprenticeship, providing my parents would grant me permission to attend meetings of the Saints and not be too strict with me.  As Richard and I passed along the streets, people made scornful remarks about us.  On the next Friday, June 1st, my attention was called to the following article, which appeared in the _Middlesbrough News_, published that morning:  \"SATURDAY.--Before W. Fallows, Esq.  \"OFF TO MORMONDOM.--At this court, two youths, named Richard Sedgwick and Robert Aveson, the former an apprentice with Mr. Carter of Gosford Street, and the latter with Mr. Gould of South Street, printer, were charged with absconding on the 18th ult. The lads, in company with a young man who has joined the Mormons and succeeded in converting the lads to his views, went from Sunderland and from thence to London by the steamer _Lady Havelock, en route_ for Utah. A warrant was sent after them, and they were apprehended in London and brought back to Middlesbrough.--Ordered to go back to their work, and the expenses to be deducted out of their wages.\"  The next day, after finishing my work at 4 o'clock, Mr. Gould brought my week's wages, but instead of my usual seven shillings and sixpence he gave me five shillings and sixpence. He said he was going to deduct"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49401"],["title","Eventful Narratives (#5)"],["body"," shillings per week until the full amount of my expenses from London was paid. This did not meet my approval, but as it was according to the decision of the court it could not be prevented.  On the following Sunday, shortly after dinner, I told my parents I wished to go for a walk. Permission was granted, but my father accompanied me.  Richard Sedgwick's parents did not take the same course with him as my parents did with me. He could attend any meetings he wished and was permitted to go where he pleased; but a strict watch was kept over me by my mother, so that I was always in a miserable suspense. Besides this, my mother was all the time talking to me when I was at home, which made me dread to see her.  On Saturday, June 9th, my mother asked me to go with her next day to a meeting of the Wesleyan Reformers.  \"Mother,\" I replied, \"I can't serve two religions at once.\"  \"Yours is the devil's religion!\" she replied.  The next morning, on going to my trunk to get on my Sunday clothes, I discovered they were not there, and on asking my mother where they were, she said:  \"Those clothes you wear every day are good enough for you to go to Mormon meetings in.\"  Pleased to think she would allow me to go even on those terms, I answered that it did not matter with me what kind of clothes I had on so long as the privilege was granted of attending \"Mormon\" meetings.  After breakfast, I went to the front door and sat on the step meditating, while people passed to and fro, dressed in their Sunday clothes. Then I looked at myself in my everyday attire, with no coat on, as mine was not to be had. It seemed to touch me on a sore part to go through the streets in my shirt sleeves, while all others were dressed in their best clothes. But I revered my religion, loved the Saints and was not going to stay in the house all day notwithstanding the clothes worn by me were shabby for the Sabbath.  The church bells were pealing and the people passing to and fro to their respective places of worship as I hurried to my place of destination--Sister Scott's--and related to the folks there how my Sunday clothes had been locked up by my mother. From one of the Saints, a young man living at Scott's, I obtained the loan of a coat. They asked me to come to the afternoon meeting, to be held at their house, which I promised to do.  Returning home about noon, my father commanded that I should stay in the house the remainder of the day. So I was prevented keeping my promise.  That afternoon was one of the most unpleasant of my life. Oh, how slowly the time passed away! I retired early to rest. My prayers were not forgotten; and while on my knees big tears rolled down my cheeks.  Richard and I intended to make our second attempt to leave home; but prior to doing so awaited an answer to a letter which had been sent to President George J. Linford while in the Thames Police office; containing our ship tickets. But three weeks passed away before the expected answer came.  On Saturday evening, June 16th, we received a letter from President Linford. It informed us that our tickets had been received all right and contained his advice to us not to again run away from our homes, but serve out our lawful apprenticeship.  The next day was the time fixed to leave our homes the second time. We intended to start at 5 o'clock in the afternoon by steamer for Shields, a town probably between forty or fifty miles northward.  In the morning of that day I attended the Presbyterian church, and it seemed to me my mother was beginning to think I was weaning myself from \"Mormonism.\"  In the afternoon, Richard and I went to Sister Scott's. There we met some of her relatives from Shields. One of them, a young lady, not intending to return that day, gave me her ticket.  One or two acquaintances of Sister Scott were going to Shields, and we intended, on arriving there, to stay with them that night. Where our final destination would be we hardly knew, though we had been thinking of going to some part of Scotland. Richard had about £1.2s. ($5.50). I had no money, but had borrowed 5s. ($1.25) from Sister Scott.  About half past 4 o'clock we went down to a boat landing, accompanied by nearly all of the Scott family and visiting relatives, who were going to Shields. The steamer we intended to go by was timed to leave at 5 o'clock; a steamer for Stockton also started at the same time. Both the steamers were moored near each other. We were there a few minutes before 5 o'clock and went with our friends into a waiting room on the landing stage. Passengers were walking about the landing, awaiting the departure of the steamers. It was our intention to go aboard the Shields steamer; but before doing so we noticed a man named Brooks, a printer, going on the Stockton steamer. Being acquainted with him, we deemed it advisable to wait till the Stockton steamer should start, for fear Brooks would see us going on the other steamer. This placed us in a rather precarious situation, as both steamers having to start at the same time, we were afraid of being unable to get on the vessel without his seeing us. Anxiously we watched the two boats, wondering which would start first, when we saw the Stockton boat make the first move. How pleased we were! It had not got many feet away when, turning to Richard, I said quickly:  \"Now, let us go!\" (meaning, of course, for us to go on the Shield's steamer.)  No sooner had I spoken these words than a brother in the Church, named John Parish, hurriedly approached us and in a half whisper, said:  \"_Here's your mother!_\"  These words perplexed and astounded me. Was it a reality that we were stopped the second time in our attempt to leave home? To be positive that Parish was correct in his assertion I looked in the direction he pointed, and there, sure enough, was my mother gazing intently at the two steamers--one on its journey and the other just ready to start.    CHAPTER X.  PLANNING TO LEAVE HOME A THIRD TIME--LEAVE MIDDLESBROUGH--ARRIVAL AT NEWCASTLE--LEITH, EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW--A PECULIAR SITUATION: NO MONEY, NO FRIENDS--MAKE UP MY MIND TO GO TO NEW YORK--ARRIVAL AT LIVERPOOL.  I left the waiting room and returned home with my mother.  It was my usual habit to be at home at 4 o'clock on Sundays, but being absent at that time on this occasion, my mother, thinking it probable I was going to a Latter-day Saint evening meeting at Stockton by steamer, came to the boat landing to look for me.  The next morning my mind was fully set to make a third attempt to leave home.  At dinner time, seeing Richard a little ahead of me on the street, I quickly overtook him and said:  \"Now, Richard, make up your mind to go away to-night.\"  He was surprised, and said:  \"We have been stopped twice now, and I don't think it's right for us to go away again; but I'll go with you if you want me to.\"  We then arranged to meet at the theatre, which was near a boat landing, at 7:30 that evening; he agreeing to bring with him out of my box (which was at Sister Scott's), a tin cup, some writing paper, envelopes, and pen and ink.  The working hours in the printing office were from 8 a.m. till 7:30 p.m. The train by which I intended to leave had to start at 7:45 p.m.  Shortly after 7 o'clock that evening it began to rain. The suit I wore was very thin and I would soon be wet through. I discovered also that a new pocket knife, recently purchased, had been left behind; so, thinking of the rain, my poor clothes and the knife, I was in two minds whether to go that night or not. I walked up and down the room in which I worked, hardly knowing what to do. Twenty-five minutes past seven came, but I was still undecided in my mind.  Presently I left the place and hurried down to where Richard was waiting near the theatre. He had the things which he was told to bring. Borrowing twelve shillings from him and, with the five shillings loaned me by Sister Scott, my total stock of cash was seventeen shillings.  The rain still continued and my clothes were wet. I parted with my friend Richard and went on a small steamboat which crossed the river Tees. After crossing, I purchased a ticket to Newcastle on-Tyne for three shillings and a penny and soon boarded the cars and started on my journey.  Newcastle was reached about half past 10 o'clock that night. Getting out of the cars I looked around for a few moments at the elegant and spacious railway station and began to wonder what was the next thing to do, as it was my intention to go to Leith next morning. After finding out where the Leith steamer sailed from I procured lodgings at a private boarding house.  At 4 o'clock I was aroused and quickly dressing myself, left the house and walked the streets for nearly two long hours. About 6 o'clock the steamer started. We arrived at Leith about 5 o'clock in the evening. Among the passengers whose acquaintance I made was an Irishman, bound for Glasgow; and having the address of the president of the Glasgow Conference, I thought it would be best to go there.  We walked from Leith to Edinburgh, about two miles distant, and then took train for Glasgow, reaching the latter place about 8 o'clock. The address I wanted to go to was about two miles from the station.  After entering the house I related to the lady there the particulars of my leaving home, during which time she prepared supper for me. She told me she expected Bro. Cluff in soon. Nearly an hour afterward Brother Cluff came in. They then held a consultation regarding me and Brother Cluff said I could say there that night, but they wished me to leave in the morning.  Next morning I started out to seek work--called at printing offices, paint shops and other places; but after traveling about all day met with no success.  In the evening I wended my way to the Conference House where they allowed me to sleep that night.  Next morning I started out again in search of employment. It appeared strange there should be numerous advertisements for boys wanted in many stores,"]]]
