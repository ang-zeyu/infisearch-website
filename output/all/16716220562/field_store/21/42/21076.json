[_He swings the blade, plunges it into the pail of         water, and laughs aloud at the hissing._  MIME          [_While Siegfried is fixing the blade in the hilt,         moves about in the foreground with the bottle into         which he has poured the contents of the pot. Aside._  He forges a sharp-edged sword:     Fafner, the foe     Of the dwarf, is doomed; I brewed a deadly draught:     Siegfried must perish     When Fafner falls. By guile the goal must be reached; Soon shall smile my reward!     For the shining ring     My brother once made,     And which with a potent     Spell he endowed,     The gleaming gold     That gives boundless might--     That ring I have won now,     I am its lord.          [_He trots briskly about with increasing         satisfaction._      Alberich even,     Whom I served,     Shall be the slave     Of Mime the dwarf.     As Nibelheim's prince     I shall descend there,     And all the host     Shall do my will;     None so honoured as he,     The dwarf once despised!     To the hoard will come thronging     Gods and men;          [_With increasing liveliness._      The world shall cower,     Cowed by my nod,     And at my frown     Shall tremble and fall!     No more shall Mime     Labour and toil,     When others win him     Unending wealth.     Mime, the valiant,     Mime is monarch,     Prince and ruler,     Lord of the world! Hei, Mime! Great luck has been thine! Had any one dreamed of this!  SIEGFRIED          [_During the pauses in Mime's song has been filing         and sharpening the sword and hammering it with the         small hammer. He flattens the rivets of the hilt         with the last strokes, and now grasps the sword._      Nothung! Nothung!     Conquering sword! Once more art thou firm in thy hilt.     Severed wert thou;     I shaped thee anew, No second blow thy blade shall shatter.     The strong steel was splintered,     My father fell;     The son who now lives     Shaped it anew. Bright-gleaming to him it laughs, And for him its edge shall be keen.          [_Swinging the sword before him._      Nothung! Nothung!     Conquering sword! Once more to life I have waked thee.     Dead wert thou,     In fragments hewn, Now shining defiant and fair.     Woe to all robbers!     Show them thy sheen!     Strike at the traitor,     Cut down the rogue! See, Mime, thou smith; Thus sunders Siegfried's sword!          [_He strikes the anvil and splits it in two from         top to bottom, so that it falls asunder with a         great noise. Mime, who has mounted a stool in great         delight, falls in terror to a fitting position on         the ground. Siegfried holds the sword exultantly on         high. The curtain falls._  [Illustration]  [Illustration   THE SECOND ACT       _A deep forest_      _Quite in the background the entrance to a cave.     The ground rises towards a flat knoll in the middle     of the stage, and slopes down again towards the     back, so that only the upper part of the entrance     to the cave is visible to the audience. To the left     a fissured cliff is seen through the trees. It is     night, the darkness being deepest at the back,     where at first the eye can distinguish nothing at     all._  ALBERICH          [_Lying by the cliff, gloomily brooding._      In night-drear woods By Neidhöhl' I keep watch,     With ear alert, Keen and anxious eye.     Timid day,     Tremblest thou forth?     Pale art thou dawning     Athwart the dark?          [_A storm arises in the wood on the right, and from         the same quarter there shines down a bluish light._  What comes yonder, gleaming bright?     Nearer shimmers     A radiant form; It runs like a horse and it shines;     Breaks through the wood,     Rushing this way. Is it the dragon's slayer? Can it mean Fafner's death?          [_The wind subsides; the light vanishes._      The glow has gone, It has faded and died;     All is darkness. Who comes there, shining in shadow?  WANDERER          [_Enters from the wood, and stops opposite Alberich._      To Neidhöhl'     By night I have come; In the dark who is hiding there?          [_As from a sudden rent in the clouds moonlight         streams forth and lights up the Wanderer's figure._  ALBERICH          [_Recognises the Wanderer and shrinks back at first         in alarm, but immediately after breaks out in         violent fury._  'Tis thou who comest thus?     What wilt thou here?     Go, get thee hence! Begone, thou insolent thief!  WANDERER [_Quietly._      Schwarz-Alberich     Wanders here? Guardest thou Fafner's house?  ALBERICH      Art thou intent     On mischief again?     Linger not here!     Off with thee straightway!     Has grief enough Not deluged the earth through thy guile?     Spare it further     Sorrow, thou wretch!  WANDERER      I come as watcher,     Not as worker. The Wanderer's way who bars?  ALBERICH  Thou arch, pestilent plotter!     Were I still the blind,     Silly fool that I was, When I was bound thy captive,     How easy were it To steal the ring again from me!     Beware! For thy cunning     I know well,          [_Mockingly._      And of thy weakness I am fully aware too.     Thy debts were cancelled,     Paid with my treasure;     My ring guerdoned     The giants' toil, Who raised thy citadel high.     Still on the mighty     Haft of thy spear there The runes are written plain Of the compact made with the churls;     And of that     Which by labour they won Thou dost not dare to despoil them:     Thy spear's strong shaft     Thou thyself wouldst split;     The staff that makes thee     Master of all Would crumble to dust in thy hand.  WANDERER  By the steadfast runes of treaties     Thou hast not,     Base one, been bound; On thee my spear may spend its strength, So keen I keep it for war.  ALBERICH      How dire thy threats!     How bold thy defiance! And yet full of fear is thy heart!     Foredoomed to death     Through my curse is he Who now guards the treasure. What heir will succeed him?     Will the hoard all desire Belong as before to the Niblung?-- That gnaws thee with ceaseless torment.     For once I have got it     Safe in my grasp, Better than foolish giants Will I employ its spell.     The God who guards heroes     Truly may tremble!     I will storm Proud Walhall with Hella's hosts, And rule, lord of the world!  WANDERER [_Quietly._      Thy design I know well,     But little I care:     Who wins the ring     Will rule by its might.  ALBERICH  Thou speakest darkly, But to me all is plain.     Thy heart is bold     Because of a boy,          [_Mockingly._  A hero begot of thy blood. Hast thou not fostered a stripling To pluck the fruit thou durst not          [_With growing violence._  Pluck frankly for thyself?  WANDERER [_Lightly._      With me     'Tis useless to wrangle; But Mime thou shouldst beware; For thy brother brings here a boy To compass the giant's doom. He knows not of me; He works for Mime alone. And so I say to thee, Do as seems to thee best.          [_Alberich makes a movement expressive of violent         curiosity._      Take my advice,     Be on thy guard: The boy will hear of the ring When Mime tells him the tale.  ALBERICH [_Violently._  Wilt thou hold thy hand from the hoard?  WANDERER      Whom I love Must fight for himself unaided;     The lord of his fate,     He stands or falls: All my hope hangs upon heroes.  ALDERICH      Does none but Mime     Dispute me the ring?  WANDERER      Only thou and Mime     Covet the gold.  ALDERICH  And yet it is not to be mine?  WANDERER [_Quietly coming nearer._      A hero comes     To set the hoard free; Two Nibelungs yearn for the gold.     Fafner falls,     He who guards the ring; Then a hand, seizing, shall hold it.     More wouldst thou learn,     There Fafner lies, Who, if warned of his death, Gladly would give up the toy. Come, I will wake him for thee.          [_He goes towards the cave, and, standing on the         rising ground in front of it, calls towards it._      Fafner! Fafner!     Wake, dragon! Wake!   ALBERICH [_With anxious amazement, aside._  Does the madman mean it? Am I to have it?  FAFNER'S VOICE  Who troubles my sleep?  WANDERER [_Facing the cave._      A well-wisher comes     To warn thee of danger; Thy doom can be averted, If thou wilt pay the price With the treasure that thou guardest.          [_He leans his ear towards the cave, listening._  FAFNER'S VOICE      What would he?  ALBERICH          [_Has come to the Wanderer and calls into the cave._      Waken, Fafner!     Dragon, awake! A doughty hero comes To try his strength against thine.  FAFNER'S VOICE      I want a meal.  WANDERER  Bold is the boy and strong; Sharp-edged is his sword.  ALBERICH      The ring he seeks,     Nothing besides. Give me the ring, and so     The strife shall be stayed.     Still guarding the hoard, In peace shalt thou live long!  FAFNER [_Yawning._      I have and I hold:--     Let me slumber!  WANDERER          [_Laughs aloud and then turns again to Alberich._  Well, Alberich! That ruse failed, But call me rogue no more.     This one thing thou shouldst     Never forget: Each according to his kind must act; Nothing can change him.     I leave thee the field now;     Show a bold front, And try thy luck with thy brother; Thou knowest his kind perhaps better.     And things unknown     Thou also shalt learn!          [_He turns away, and disappears quickly in the         wood. A storm arises and a bright light breaks         forth; then both quickly cease._  ALBERICH          [_Looks after the Wanderer as he gallops off._      Away on his shining     Horse he rides, And leaves me to care and scorn!     Laugh on! Laugh on,     Ye light-minded     And high-spirited     Race of immortals!     One day ye shall perish     And pass!     Until the gold     Has ceased to gleam,     Will wise Alberich watch,     And his hate shall prevail.          [_He slips into the chasm at the side.

Siegfried carries his sword in a sword-belt of rope. Mime examines the place carefully. At last he looks towards the background, which remains in deep shadow, whilst the rising ground in the middle becomes, after a time, more and more brightly illuminated by the sun._  MIME      Our journey ends here;     Here we halt.  SIEGFRIED          [_Sits down under the lime-tree and looks about         him._  So here I shall learn what fear is? A far way thou hast led me; We have wandered lone together A whole night long in the woods.     This is the last     Of thee, Mime!     Can I not master     My lesson here, Alone I will push forward And never see thee again.  MIME      Lad, believe me,     If thou canst not Learn it here and now,     No other place,     No other time Ever will teach thee fear.     Dost thou see That cavern yawning dark?     Yonder dwells A dragon dread and grim,     Horribly fierce,     Enormous in size,     With terrible jaws     That threaten and gape;     With skin and hair,     All at a gulp, The brute could swallow thee whole.  SIEGFRIED          [_Still sitting under the lime-tree._  'Twere well to close up his gullet; His fangs I will therefore avoid.  MIME      Poison pours     From his venomous mouth;     Were he to spue out     Spittle on thee, Thy body and bones would decay.  SIEGFRIED  That the poison may not consume me, I will keep out of its reach.  MIME      A serpent's tail     Sweeping he swings;     Were that about thee wound     And folded close, Thy limbs would be broken like glass.  SIEGFRIED  That his swinging tail may not touch me, Warily then I must watch.     But answer me this:     Has the brute a heart?  MIME  A pitiless, cruel heart.  SIEGFRIED      It lies, however,     Where all hearts lie, Brute and human alike?  MIME      Of course! There, boy,     The dragon's lies too. At last thou beginnest to fear?  SIEGFRIED          [_Who till now has been lying indolently stretched         out, sits up suddenly._      Nothung into     His heart I will thrust! Is that what is meant by fearing?     Hey, old dotard!     Canst thou teach me     Nothing but this     With all thy craft, Linger no longer by me: No fear is here to be learnt.  MIME      Wait awhile yet!     What I have told thee Seems to thee empty sound;     When thou hast heard     And seen him thyself, Thy senses will swoon, overwhelmed!     When thine eyes grow dim,     And when the ground rocks,     When in thy breast     Thy heart beats loud,          [_Very friendly._  Thou wilt remember who brought thee, And think of me and my love.  SIEGFRIED      Thy love is not wanted!     Hast thou not heard?     Out of my sight with thee;     Let me alone! Begin again talking of love, And on the instant I go!     The horrible winking,     The nods and blinking--     When shall I see     The last of them, And rid be at length of the fool?  MIME      Well, I will off, And rest there by the spring.     Thou must stay here, And as the sun scales the sky     Watch for the foe:     From his cave     He lumbers this way,     Winds and twists     Past this spot, To water at the fountain.  SIEGFRIED [_Laughs._  Liest thou by the spring, Unchecked thither the brute shall go;     He shall swallow thee     Down with the water,     Ere with my sword     To the heart I stab him! So heed well what I say: Rest not beside the spring.     Seek somewhere else     A far-off spot, And nevermore return.  MIME      Thou wilt not refuse     Cooling refreshment When the fierce fight is over?          [_Siegfried motions him angrily away._      Call on me too     Shouldst thou need counsel,          [_Siegfried repeats the gesture with more violence._  Or if felled on a sudden by fear.          [_Siegfried rises and drives him away with furious         gestures._  MIME [_Aside, as he goes away._      Fafner and Siegfried--     Siegfried and Fafner-- Might each the other but slay!          [_He disappears in the wood on the right._  SIEGFRIED          [_Stretches himself at his ease under the         lime-tree, and looks after Mime as he departs._  He is no father of mine! How merry of heart I feel!     Never before     Seemed the forest fair;     Never day     Wore as lovely a smile, For the loathed one has gone at last, To be looked on by me no more.          [_He meditates in silence._  My father--what was he like?-- Ha! like me, without doubt. Had Mime by chance had a son,     He would have been     Mime's image:     Quite as disgusting,     Filthy and grey,     Small and bent,     Hunchbacked and halting,     With ears long and hanging,     Rheumy eyes running--     Off with the fright! To see him makes me sick!          [_He leans further back and looks up through the         branches of the tree. Deep silence. Woodland         murmurs._      What could my mother,     I wonder, be like;     That is not     So easy to picture.          [_Very tenderly._  Her clear shining eyes     Must have been soft, And gentle like the roe-deer's,     Only far fairer.          [_Very softly._  In fear and woe she bore me, But why did she die through me? Must then all human mothers     Thus die on giving     Birth to a son? That would truly be sad!     Ah, if I only     Could see my mother!--     See my mother,     A woman once!          [_He sighs softly, and leans still further back.         Deep silence. Louder murmuring of the wood. His         attention is at last caught by the song of the         birds. He listens with growing interest to one         singing in the branches above him._      O lovely warbler,     I know not thy note; Hast thou thy home in this wood? If I could but understand him, His sweet song might say much-- Perhaps of my mother tell me.     A surly old dwarf     Said to me once     That men might learn     To follow the sense Of birds when they were singing; Could it indeed be done?     Ha! I will sing     After him, On the reed follow him sweetly.     Though wanting the words,     Repeating his measure-- Singing what is his language-- Perhaps I shall know what he says.          [_He runs to the neighbouring spring, cuts a reed         off with his sword, and quickly makes himself a         pipe out of it. He listens again._      He stops to hear,     So now for my song!          [_He blows into the pipe, breaks off, and cuts         it again to improve it. He resumes his blowing,         shakes his head, and cuts the pipe once more. After         another attempt he gets angry, presses the pipe         with his hand, and tries again. He ceases playing         and smiles._      That rings not right;     For the lovely tune The reed is not suited at all.     I fear, sweet bird,     I am too dull; Thy song cannot I learn.          [_He hears the bird again and looks up to him._      He listens so roguishly     There that he shames me;          [_Very tenderly._  He waits, and nothing rewards him.     Heida! Come hearken     Now to my horn;          [_He flings the pipe away._      All I do sounds wrong     On the stupid reed;     To a song of the woods     That I know, A merry song, listen now rather.     I hoped it would bring     Some comrade to me,     But wolves and bears     Were the best that came.     Now I will see     Who answers its note: What comrade will come to its call.          [_He takes the silver hunting-horn and blows on         it. During the long-sustained notes he keeps his         eyes expectantly on the bird. A movement in the         background. Fafner, in the form of a monstrous         lizard-like dragon, has risen from his lair in the         cave. He breaks through the underwood and drags         himself up to the higher ground, so that the front         part of his body rests on it, while he utters a         loud sound, as if yawning._  SIEGFRIED          [_Looks round and gazes at Fafner in astonishment.         He laughs._      My horn with its note     Has allured something lovely; A jolly companion wert thou.  FAFNER          [_At the sight of Siegfried has paused on the high         ground, and remains there._      What is that?  SIEGFRIED      If thou art a beast     Who can use its tongue, Perchance thou couldst teach me something.     Here stands one     Who would learn to fear; Say, wilt thou be his teacher?  FAFNER      Is this insolence?  SIEGFRIED      Courage or insolence,     What matter? With my sword I will slay thee, Wilt thou not teach me to fear.  FAFNER [_Makes a laughing sound._      Drink I came for;     Now food I find too!          [_He opens his jaws and shows his teeth._  SIEGFRIED      What a fine set of teeth     Thou showest me there!     Sweetly they smile     In thy dainty mouth! 'Twere well if I closed up thy gullet; Thy jaws are gaping too wide!  FAFNER      They were not made     For idle talk,     But they will serve     To swallow thee.  SIEGFRIED      Hoho! Ferocious,     Merciless churl!     I have no fancy     To be eaten. Better it seems to me That without delay thou shouldst die!  FAFNER [_Roaring._      Pruh! Come,     Boy, with thy boasts!  SIEGFRIED [_Draws his sword._      Beware, growler!     The boaster comes!          [_He springs towards Fafner and remains defiantly         confronting him. Fafner drags himself further up         the knoll and spits at Siegfried from his nostrils.         Siegfried avoids the poison, springs nearer, and         stands on one side. Fafner tries to reach him         with his tail. Siegfried, who is nearly caught,         springs over Fafner with one bound, and wounds him         in the tail. Fafner roars, pulls his tail angrily         away, and raises the front part of his body so         that he may throw its full weight on Siegfried,         thus offering his breast to the stroke. Siegfried         quickly looks to see where his heart is, and         thrusts his sword into it up to the hilt. Fafner         raises himself still higher in "]]]
