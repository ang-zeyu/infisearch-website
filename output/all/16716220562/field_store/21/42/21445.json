MARINA.                      But what    If I expose beforehand thy bold fraud    To all men?     PRETENDER. Dost thou think I fear thee? Think'st thou    They will believe a Polish maiden more    Than Russia's own tsarevich? Know, proud lady,    That neither king, nor pope, nor nobles trouble    Whether my words be true, whether I be    Dimitry or another. What care they?    But I provide a pretext for revolt    And war; and this is all they need; and thee,    Rebellious one, believe me, they will force    To hold thy peace. Farewell.     MARINA.                    Tsarevich, stay!    At last I hear the speech not of a boy,    But of a man. It reconciles me to thee.    Prince, I forget thy senseless outburst, see    Again Dimitry. Listen; now is the time!    Hasten; delay no more, lead on thy troops    Quickly to Moscow, purge the Kremlin, take    Thy seat upon the throne of Moscow; then    Send me the nuptial envoy; but, God hears me,    Until thy foot be planted on its steps,    Until by thee Boris be overthrown,    I am not one to listen to love-speeches.     PRETENDER. No--easier far to strive with Godunov.    Or play false with the Jesuits of the Court,    Than with a woman. Deuce take them; they're beyond    My power. She twists, and coils, and crawls, slips out    Of hand, she hisses, threatens, bites. Ah, serpent!    Serpent! 'Twas not for nothing that I trembled.    She well-nigh ruined me; but I'm resolved;    At daybreak I will put my troops in motion.     THE LITHUANIAN FRONTIER  (OCTOBER 16TH, 1604)  PRINCE KURBSKY and PRETENDER, both on horseback. Troops approach the Frontier     KURBSKY. (Galloping at their head.)    There, there it is; there is the Russian frontier!    Fatherland! Holy Russia! I am thine!    With scorn from off my clothing now I shake    The foreign dust, and greedily I drink    New air; it is my native air. O father,    Thy soul hath now been solaced; in the grave    Thy bones, disgraced, thrill with a sudden joy!    Again doth flash our old ancestral sword,    This glorious sword--the dread of dark Kazan!    This good sword--servant of the tsars of Moscow!    Now will it revel in its feast of slaughter,    Serving the master of its hopes.     PRETENDER. (Moves quietly with bowed head.) How happy    Is he, how flushed with gladness and with glory    His stainless soul! Brave knight, I envy thee!    The son of Kurbsky, nurtured in exile,    Forgetting all the wrongs borne by thy father,    Redeeming his transgression in the grave,    Ready art thou for the son of great Ivan    To shed thy blood, to give the fatherland    Its lawful tsar. Righteous art thou; thy soul    Should flame with joy.     KURBSKY.             And dost not thou likewise    Rejoice in spirit? There lies our Russia; she    Is thine, tsarevich! There thy people's hearts    Are waiting for thee, there thy Moscow waits,    Thy Kremlin, thy dominion.     PRETENDER.               Russian blood,    O Kurbsky, first must flow! Thou for the tsar    Hast drawn the sword, thou art stainless; but I lead you    Against your brothers; I am summoning    Lithuania against Russia; I am showing    To foes the longed-for way to beauteous Moscow!    But let my sin fall not on me, but thee,    Boris, the regicide! Forward! Set on!     KURBSKY. Forward! Advance! And woe to Godunov.     (They gallop. The troops cross the frontier.)     THE COUNCIL OF THE TSAR  The TSAR, the PATRIARCH and Boyars     TSAR. Is it possible? An unfrocked monk against us    Leads rascal troops, a truant friar dares write    Threats to us! Then 'tis time to tame the madman!    Trubetskoy, set thou forth, and thou Basmanov;    My zealous governors need help. Chernigov    Already by the rebel is besieged;    Rescue the city and citizens.     BASMANOV.                   Three months    Shall not pass, Sire, ere even rumour's tongue    Shall cease to speak of the pretender; caged    In iron, like a wild beast from oversea,    We'll hale him into Moscow, I swear by God.     (Exit with TRUBETSKOY.)     TSAR. The Lord of Sweden hath by envoys tendered    Alliance to me. But we have no need    To lean on foreign aid; we have enough    Of our own warlike people to repel    Traitors and Poles. I have refused.--Shchelkalov!    In every district to the governors    Send edicts, that they mount their steeds, and send    The people as of old on service; likewise    Ride to the monasteries, and there enlist    The servants of the churchmen. In days of old,    When danger faced our country, hermits freely    Went into battle; it is not now our wish    To trouble them; no, let them pray for us;    Such is the tsar's decree, such the resolve    Of his boyars. And now a weighty question    We shall determine; ye know how everywhere    The insolent pretender hath spread abroad    His artful rumours; letters everywhere,    By him distributed, have sowed alarm    And doubt; seditious whispers to and fro    Pass in the market-places; minds are seething.    We needs must cool them; gladly would I refrain    From executions, but by what means and how?    That we will now determine. Holy father,    Thou first declare thy thought.     PATRIARCH.                    The Blessed One,    The All-Highest, hath instilled into thy soul,    Great lord, the spirit of kindness and meek patience;    Thou wishest not perdition for the sinner,    Thou wilt wait quietly, until delusion    Shall pass away; for pass away it will,    And truth's eternal sun will dawn on all.    Thy faithful bedesman, one in worldly matters    No prudent judge, ventures today to offer    His voice to thee. This offspring of the devil,    This unfrocked monk, has known how to appear    Dimitry to the people. Shamelessly    He clothed himself with the name of the tsarevich    As with a stolen vestment. It only needs    To tear it off--and he'll be put to shame    By his own nakedness. The means thereto    God hath Himself supplied. Know, sire, six years    Since then have fled; 'twas in that very year    When to the seat of sovereignty the Lord    Anointed thee--there came to me one evening    A simple shepherd, a venerable old man,    Who told me a strange secret. \"In my young days,\"    He said, \"I lost my sight, and thenceforth knew not    Nor day, nor night, till my old age; in vain    I plied myself with herbs and secret spells;    In vain did I resort in adoration    To the great wonder-workers in the cloister;    Bathed my dark eyes in vain with healing water    From out the holy wells. The Lord vouchsafed not    Healing to me. Then lost I hope at last,    And grew accustomed to my darkness. Even    Slumber showed not to me things visible,    Only of sounds I dreamed. Once in deep sleep    I hear a childish voice; it speaks to me:    `Arise, grandfather, go to Uglich town,    To the Cathedral of Transfiguration;    There pray over my grave. The Lord is gracious--    And I shall pardon thee.'  `But who art thou?'    I asked the childish voice. `I am the tsarevich    Dimitry, whom the Heavenly Tsar hath taken    Into His angel band, and I am now    A mighty wonder-worker. Go, old man.'    I woke, and pondered. What is this? Maybe    God will in very deed vouchsafe to me    Belated healing. I will go. I bent    My footsteps to the distant road. I reached    Uglich, repair unto the holy minster,    Hear mass, and, glowing with zealous soul, I weep    Sweetly, as if the blindness from mine eyes    Were flowing out in tears. And when the people    Began to leave, to my grandson I said:    `Lead me, Ivan, to the grave of the tsarevich    Dimitry.' The boy led me--and I scarce    Had shaped before the grave a silent prayer,    When sight illumed my eyeballs; I beheld    The light of God, my grandson, and the tomb.\"    That is the tale, Sire, which the old man told.     (General agitation. In the course of this speech Boris    several times wipes his face with his handkerchief.)     To Uglich then I sent, where it was learned    That many sufferers had found likewise    Deliverance at the grave of the tsarevich.    This is my counsel; to the Kremlin send    The sacred relics, place them in the Cathedral    Of the Archangel; clearly will the people    See then the godless villain's fraud; the might    Of the fiends will vanish as a cloud of dust.     (Silence.)     PRINCE SHUISKY. What mortal, holy father, knoweth the ways    Of the All-Highest? 'Tis not for me to judge Him.    Untainted sleep and power of wonder-working    He may upon the child's remains bestow;    But vulgar rumour must dispassionately    And diligently be tested; is it for us,    In stormy times of insurrection,    To weigh so great a matter? Will men not say    That insolently we made of sacred things    A worldly instrument? Even now the people    Sway senselessly this way and that, even now    There are enough already of loud rumours;    This is no time to vex the people's minds    With aught so unexpected, grave, and strange.    I myself see 'tis needful to demolish    The rumour spread abroad by the unfrocked monk;    But for this end other and simpler means    Will serve. Therefore, when it shall please thee, Sire,    I will myself appear in public places,    I will persuade, exhort away this madness,    And will expose the vagabond's vile fraud.     TSAR. So be it! My lord Patriarch, I pray thee    Go with us to the palace, where today    I must converse with thee.     (Exeunt; all the boyars follow them.)     1ST BOYAR. (Sotto voce to another.) Didst mark how pale    Our sovereign turned, how from his face there poured    A mighty sweat?     2ND BOYAR.    I durst not, I confess,    Uplift mine eyes, nor breathe, nor even stir.     1ST BOYAR. Prince Shuisky has pulled it through. A    splendid fellow!

Spare Russian blood. Cease    fighting.     OPEN SPACE IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL IN MOSCOW  THE PEOPLE     ONE OF THE PEOPLE. Will the tsar soon come out of the    Cathedral?     ANOTHER. The mass is ended; now the Te Deum is going on.     THE FIRST. What! Have they already cursed him?     THE SECOND. I stood in the porch and heard how the deacon    cried out:--Grishka Otrepiev is anathema!     THE FIRST. Let him curse to his heart's content; the    tsarevich has nothing to do with the Otrepiev.     THE SECOND. But they are now singing mass for the repose    of the soul of the tsarevich.     THE FIRST. What? A mass for the dead sung for a living    Man? They'll suffer for it, the godless wretches!     A THIRD. Hist! A sound. Is it not the tsar?     A FOURTH. No, it is the idiot.     (An idiot enters, in an iron cap, hung round with    chains, surrounded by boys.)     THE BOYS. Nick, Nick, iron nightcap! T-r-r-r-r--     OLD WOMAN. Let him be, you young devils. Innocent one,    pray thou for me a sinner.     IDIOT. Give, give, give a penny.     OLD WOMAN. There is a penny for thee; remember me in    thy prayers.     IDIOT.

(A Russian prisoner enters.)     Who art thou?     PRISONER.   Rozhnov, a nobleman of Moscow.     PRETENDER. Hast long been in the service?     PRISONER.                               About a month.     PRETENDER. Art not ashamed, Rozhnov, that thou hast drawn    The sword against me?     PRISONER.           What else could I do?    'Twas not our fault.     PRETENDER.         Didst fight beneath the walls    Of Seversk?     PRISONER. 'Twas two weeks after the battle    I came from Moscow.     PRETENDER.        What of Godunov?     PRISONER. The battle's loss, Mstislavsky's wound, hath caused him    Much apprehension; Shuisky he hath sent    To take command.     PRETENDER.     But why hath he recalled    Basmanov unto Moscow?     PRISONER.           The tsar rewarded    His services with honour and with gold.    Basmanov in the council of the tsar    Now sits.     PRETENDER. The army had more need of him.    Well, how go things in Moscow?     PRISONER.                    All is quiet,    Thank God.     PRETENDER. Say, do they look for me?     PRISONER.                          God knows;    They dare not talk too much there now. Of some    The tongues have been cut off, of others even    The heads. It is a fearsome state of things--    Each day an execution. All the prisons    Are crammed. Wherever two or three forgather    In public places, instantly a spy    Worms himself in; the tsar himself examines    At leisure the denouncers. It is just    Sheer misery; so silence is the best.     PRETENDER. An enviable life for the tsar's people!    Well, how about the army?     PRISONER.               What of them?    Clothed and full-fed they are content with all.     PRETENDER. But is there much of it?     PRISONER.                         God knows.     PRETENDER.                          All told    Will there be thirty thousand?     PRISONER.                    Yes; 'twill run    Even to fifty thousand.     (The Pretender reflects; those around him glance at    one another.)     PRETENDER.            Well! Of me    What say they in your camp?     PRISONER.                 Your graciousness    They speak of; say that thou, Sire, (be not wrath),    Art a thief, but a fine fellow.     PRETENDER. (Laughing.)        Even so    I'll prove myself to them in deed. My friends,    We will not wait for Shuisky; I wish you joy;    Tomorrow, battle.     (Exit.)     ALL.            Long life to Dimitry!     A POLE. Tomorrow, battle! They are fifty thousand,    And we scarce fifteen thousand. He is mad!     ANOTHER. That's nothing, friend. A single Pole can challenge    Five hundred Muscovites.     PRISONER.              Yes, thou mayst challenge!    But when it comes to fighting, then, thou braggart,    Thou'lt run away.     POLE.           If thou hadst had a sword,    Insolent prisoner, then (pointing to his sword) with this I'd soon    Have vanquished thee.     PRISONER.           A Russian can make shift    Without a sword; how like you this (shows his fist), you fool?     (The Pole looks at him haughtily and departs in    silence. All laugh.)

How gallantly he charged    Today in the last battle, and when wounded,    How swiftly bore me. My poor horse!     PUSHKIN. (To himself.)            Well, here's    A great ado about a horse, when all    Our army's smashed to bits.     PRETENDER.                Listen! Perhaps    He's but exhausted by the loss of blood,    And will recover.     PUSHKIN.        Nay, nay; he is dying.     PRETENDER. (Goes to his horse.)    My poor horse!--what to do? Take off the bridle,    And loose the girth. Let him at least die free.     (He unbridles and unsaddles the horse. Some Poles    enter.)     Good day to you, gentlemen! How is't I see not    Kurbsky among you? I did note today    How to the thick of the fight he clove his path;    Around the hero's sword, like swaying ears    Of corn, hosts thronged; but higher than all of them    His blade was brandished, and his terrible cry    Drowned all cries else. Where is my knight?     POLE.                                     He fell    On the field of battle.     PRETENDER.            Honour to the brave,    And peace be on his soul! How few unscathed    Are left us from the fight! Accursed Cossacks,    Traitors and miscreants, you, you it is    Have ruined us! Not even for three minutes    To keep the foe at bay! I'll teach the villains!    Every tenth man I'll hang. Brigands!     PUSHKIN.                           Whoe'er    Be guilty, all the same we were clean worsted,    Routed!     PRETENDER. But yet we nearly conquered. Just    When I had dealt with their front rank, the Germans    Repulsed us utterly. But they're fine fellows!    By God! Fine fellows! I love them for it. From them    I'll form an honourable troop.     PUSHKIN.                     And where    Shall we now spend the night?     PRETENDER.                  Why, here, in the forest.    Why not this for our night quarters? At daybreak    We'll take the road, and dine in Rilsk. Good night.     (He lies down, puts a saddle under his head, and falls    asleep.)     PUSHKIN. A pleasant sleep, tsarevich! Smashed to bits,    Rescued by flight alone, he is as careless    As a simple child; 'tis clear that Providence    Protects him, and we, my friends, will not lose heart.     MOSCOW. PALACE OF THE TSAR  BORIS. BASMANOV     TSAR. He is vanquished, but what profit lies in that?    We are crowned with a vain conquest; he has mustered    Again his scattered forces, and anew    Threatens us from the ramparts of Putivl.    Meanwhile what are our heroes doing? They stand    At Krom, where from its rotten battlements    A band of Cossacks braves them. There is glory!    No, I am ill content with them; thyself    I shall despatch to take command of them;    I give authority not to birth, but brains.    Their pride of precedence, let it be wounded!    The time has"]]]
