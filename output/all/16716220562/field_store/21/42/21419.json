The Modifier was what he needed to change Ronald. Or to shut him off.  If only the Master Chart hadn't been lost, so he would know what the Modifier looked like! He hoped the Modifier itself wasn't lost. He hated to think of Ronald locked in the Usher tomb of the File Room for 18 flat years. Long before that, he would have worn his fists away hammering at the hatch. Then he might start pounding with his head. Perhaps before the time was up he would have worn himself down to nothing whatsoever.  Manet selected the ripple-finished gray-covered manual from the hodgepodge, and thought: eighteen years.  Perhaps I should have begun here, he told himself. But I really don't have as much interest in that sort of thing as the earthier types. Simple companionship was all I wanted. And, he thought on, even an insipid personality like Ronald's would be bearable with certain compensations.  Manet opened the book to the chapter headed: <i>The Making of a Girl</i>.  <tb>  Veronica crept up behind Manet and slithered her hands up his back and over his shoulders. She leaned forward and breathed a moist warmth into his ear, and worried the lobe with her even white teeth.  \"Daniel Boone,\" she sighed huskily, \"only killed three Indians in his life.\"  \"I know.\"  Manet folded his arms stoically and added: \"Please don't talk.\"  She sighed her instant agreement and moved her expressive hands over his chest and up to the hollows of his throat.  \"I need a shave,\" he observed.  Her hands instantly caressed his face to prove that she liked a rather bristly, masculine countenance.  Manet elbowed Veronica away in a gentlemanly fashion.  She made her return.  \"Not now,\" he instructed her.  \"Whenever you say.\"  He stood up and began pacing off the dimensions of the compartment. There was no doubt about it: he had been missing his regular exercise.  \"Now?\" she asked.  \"I'll tell you.\"  \"If you were a jet pilot,\" Veronica said wistfully, \"you would be romantic. You would grab love when you could. You would never know which moment would be last. You would make the most of each one.\"  \"I'm not a jet pilot,\" Manet said. \"There are no jet pilots. There haven't been any for generations.\"  \"Don't be silly,\" Veronica said. \"Who else would stop those vile North Koreans and Red China 'volunteers'?\"  \"Veronica,\" he said carefully, \"the Korean War is over. It was finished even before the last of the jet pilots.\"  \"Don't be silly,\" she snapped. \"If it were over, I'd know about it, wouldn't I?\"  She would, except that somehow she had turned out even less bright, less equipped with Manet's own store of information, than Ronald. Whoever had built the Lifo kit must have had ancient ideas about what constituted appropriate \"feminine\" characteristics.  \"I suppose,\" he said heavily, \"that you would like me to take you back to Earth and introduce you to Daniel Boone?\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"Veronica, your stupidity is hideous.\"  She lowered her long blonde lashes on her pink cheeks. \"That is a mean thing to say to me. But I forgive you.\"  An invisible hand began pressing down steadily on the top of his head until it forced a sound out of him. \"Aaaawrraagggh! Must you be so cloyingly sweet? Do you have to keep taking that? Isn't there any fight in you at all?\"  He stepped forward and back-handed her across the jaw.  It was the first time he had ever struck a woman, he realized regretfully. He now knew he should have been doing it long ago.  Veronica sprang forward and led with a right.  <tb>  Ronald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through the corridor.  \"Hear that?\" he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth.  \"No, darling.\"  Well, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignore the noise. She was still following orders.  \"Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald,\" the voice carried through sepulchrally.  \"Shut up!\" Manet yelled.  The voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off.  A silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it.  Why hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly took comfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through the station.  Manet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch.  Ronald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. His hands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lips seemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all the shouting but from having nothing to drink for some months.  Ronald didn't say anything to Manet.  But he looked offended.  \"You,\" Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back, \"inside, inside.\"  Ronald sidestepped the lurching girl.  \"Do you know what I'm going to do with you?\" Manet demanded. \"I'm going to lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year, forever! Now what do you think about that?\"  \"If you think it's the <i>right</i> thing, dear,\" Veronica said hesitantly.  \"You know best, Willy,\" Ronald said uncertainly.  Manet slammed the hatch in disgust.  Manet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers of his reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walk carefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But he walked too carefully for this to happen.  As he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: \"In my opinion, William, you should let us out.\"  \"I,\" Veronica said, \"honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill, dearest.\"  Manet giggled. \"What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take you back after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend?\"  He went down the corridor, giggling.  He giggled and thought: This will never do.  <tb>  Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manual diligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in the box to go around.  The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, The Model Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.  He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to make any one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.  He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from him for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.  Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.  But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.  Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he did so, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.  He glanced forward and found the headings: <i>The Final Model</i>.  There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paid a price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came to that? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that he could.  He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment of ill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind and under his fingers....  Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.  Victor was finished. Perfect.  Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.  \"Move!\"  Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of the flesh-sprayers.  As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realized that it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.  \"It's finished!\" were Victor's first words. \"It's done!\"  Manet stared at the tiny wreck. \"To say the least.\"  Victor stepped out of the oblong box. \"There is something you should understand. I am different from the others.\"  \"They all say that.\"  \"I am not your friend.\"  \"No?\"  \"No. You have made yourself an enemy.\"  Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasure at the symmetry of the situation.  \"It completes the final course in socialization,\" Victor continued. \"I am your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have <i>all</i> your knowledge. <i>You</i> do not have all your knowledge. If you let yourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It is my function to use everything I possibly can against you.\"  \"When do you start?\"  \"I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.\"  \"What's so bad about that?\" Manet asked with some interest.  \"You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll never change. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose your interest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'll never change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I've made the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man. <i>I've seen that you will always keep your friends.</i>\"  <tb>  The prospect <i>was</i> frightful.  Victor smiled. \"Aren't you going to denounce me for a fiend?\"  \"Yes, it is time for the denouncement. Tell me, you feel that now you are through? You have fulfilled your function?\"  \"Yes. Yes.\"  \"Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and see me suffer?\"  \"<i>Yes.</i>\"  \"No. Can't do it, old man. Can't. <i>I</i> know. You're too human, too like me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a state of uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it. Something has to be happening to him. He has to be happening to something. You didn't kill me because then you would have nothing left to do. You'll never kill me.\"  \"Of course not!\" Victor stormed. \"Fundamental safety cut-off!\"  \"Rationalization. You don't <i>want</i> to kill me. And you can't stop challenging me at every turn. That's your function.\"  \"Stop talking and just think about your miserable life,\" Victor said meanly. \"Your friends won't grow and mature with you. You won't make any new friends. You'll have me to constantly remind you of your uselessness, your constant unrelenting sterility of purpose. How's that for boredom, for passiveness?\"  \"That's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Manet said irritably, his social manners rusty. \"I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50818"],["title","How to Make Friends (#3)"],["body","rpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every foot of the way. Don't you see? With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend!\""]]]
