Care must also be used in dissolving dye. Granules in the dye-bath work havoc with an otherwise beautiful piece of dyeing. The dye should be filtered through a closely woven cloth. Prepared dyes insure safety, as the compounding and dissolving is done by formula.  After the last dyeing the fabric should be rinsed first in warm, then in cold water. Much of the wax is removed in the rinsing. The remainder of the wax is easily removed by ironing between layers of newspaper, followed if necessary by a bath of gasoline. If the piece is very large it should be finished by a professional cleaner.  There are different approved methods of pattern dyeing with wax resist, in the choice of which the craftsman must consider the conditions under which the work is to be done. We give in outline the steps of three methods:  I. Painting the decoration within waxed outlines, followed by one or more baths for the ground color. This is illustrated on pages 55, 56 and 57, where the following steps were taken:  1. A square of white china silk, clean and free of sizing, was stretched on a frame.  2. The main lines were sketched in with charcoal. The design was outlined in wax. The shapes were made small, as dye is liable to streak when painted over large areas.  3. The colors were mixed and used like water colors.  4. The small bell-shaped flowers were painted red, the pods yellow, the leaves green. These painted surfaces were then stopped out with wax.  5. Two gallons of warm water were softened and made into a soap suds. This solution was divided into two equal parts. The first part was used for wetting the fabric, and \"soaping off\" after dyeing. The second part was made into a brown dye-bath for the dipping.    [Illustration: THE COMPLETED PATTERN {p. 63}]  II. Painting directly on the fabric without waxed outlines, and building up the ground color in one or more baths. The piece illustrated on page 59 was done as follows:  1. The design was drawn free hand upon the fabric, stretched in a frame.  2. The colors were painted directly. The tree was green, the bell-like flowers orange, the dogs golden yellow. The brush strokes were very small.  3. The colored shapes were carefully covered with wax.  4. The background was dyed a deep purple.  III. Building up the pattern by dyeing in successive baths, beginning with the lighter and passing to darker values, and before each dipping stopping out with wax the parts to be retained in the completed work. The piece illustrated on pages 61 and 63 was executed as follows:  1. The design was drawn on strong paper. This was then perforated, and the design pounced on the silk with powdered charcoal, using a stiff bristle brush and scrubbing the charcoal well through the holes.  2. The parts to remain white were stopped out by painting with wax.  3. The piece was dyed yellow, after which the design was again pounced.    [Illustration: SELECTED WORK OF ELEMENTARY HIGH SCHOOL CLASS {p. 65}]  4. The parts to remain yellow were stopped out with wax.  5. The piece was dyed black.  In all these processes a small piece of the goods was carried completely through the dye-bath to test the color.  Some modifications of these processes are valuable. These follow, or are suggested by, practices of the Orient.  1. The design may be applied with blown stenciling.  2. Block printing and stick printing may be used and the color impressions covered with wax.  As concrete illustrations of textile decoration in schools we present some of the results of two class problems in high school, the one by a first and second year class, the other by third and fourth year pupils with a few who were posting.  _First and Second Year Class._ The pupils used the method of paper cutting to secure motives for their designs. Each pupil was supplied with enough white silk to make a collar, or a tie, also with color, wax and a frame upon which to stretch the silk. The method was that of outlining in wax, painting in color, and dipping for the ground color. The pupils were allowed to keep their work after paying for the materials. The illustrations on page 65 were chosen from the finished pieces.  The crepe-de-chene collar is 12 x 12 inches. The outside border and the largest shape at the point of the collar were old rose, the fan-like shape turquoise blue, the band and spottings at the side yellow. The inside border, buds and stem were blue and the alternating shapes yellow.    [Illustration: ALL-OVER PATTERN, ADVANCED HIGH SCHOOL {p. 67}]  These colors were covered with wax and the collar dyed gray. It was then dipped in hot wax, carefully crackled and dipped in a dark gray bath. The wax was removed by ironing between layers of newspaper. Fine embroidery silk was dyed yellow and old rose for the stitchery that finished the edge of the collar.  The sailor collar was made of white china silk. The leaves of the design were painted green, the flowers rose color and the ground dyed a dark gray blue. The dye-bath was made of blue, black and purple. The collar was finished with yellow and old rose stitchery.  The pongee silk vest was designed for a tailored coat. The leaves and flowers were painted realistically. The ground was dyed blue and crackled in a darker blue bath. The edge was finished with dark red stitchery.  _Third and Fourth Year Class._ This work was conducted at a later time. In addition to more training, these pupils had for study many specimens of good batiks and standard illustrations of the same. The designs were made with reference to their fitness as batik designs.  The design units illustrated on page 73 were selected with reference to their adaptability to some form of all-over application.  The design for the book cover, also shown as an all-over pattern, page 70, the all-over pattern, page 67, and the scarf, page 69, were selected as the best work of this class.    [Illustration: ALL-OVER PATTERN, ADVANCED HIGH SCHOOL {p. 69}]    [Illustration: ALL-OVER PATTERN, ADVANCED HIGH SCHOOL {p. 70}]    [Illustration: ALL-OVER PATTERNS, ADVANCED HIGH SCHOOL {p. 71}]  A tracing of the all-over design, page 67, was first made and painted in water colors. The design was transferred to the silk by tracing. The colors of the decoration, following the copy in water color, were painted in without the use of wax outlines. The top units from left to right were blue, violet, yellow; second row, violet, blue, green, violet; third row, yellow, violet, blue; fourth row, violet, blue, green, violet. The stems were violet, the leaves yellow green. The background was dyed a rich brown.  The all-over design, page 69, was used for the end of a scarf. The silk was dyed yellow, parts of the decoration stopped out with wax, the flowers and body of the insect painted in red, the red stopped out with wax, and the background dyed brown. The scarf was finished with a fringe of orange silk.  The all-over design, page 70, was pounced on the silk after each dipping. The material was dyed yellow and the small spottings stopped out. The piece was dipped in a gray purple dye-bath. The resultant color was a grayed lavender. The larger shapes in the design were stopped out and the ground color dyed a deeper purple.  Two other examples of batiks from this class are illustrated:  1. The china silk blouse, page 71, with a yellow background and all-over pattern of white, blue and green shows a design that is suitable for yardage.  2. An all-over design, page 71, also suitable for yardage. The lavender flowers and leaves were painted inside waxed outlines. The spots were connected by flowing waxed outlines. The decoration was covered with wax and the ground color dyed a pale yellow gray.    [Illustration: DESIGN UNITS FOR ALL-OVER PATTERNS {p. 73}]  The china silk handkerchief, page 74, is very interesting. The size is 17 x 17 inches with a one-inch hem. The area inside the hem was covered with wax, placed in a bath of cold water, and carefully crackled. It was then immersed in a blue dye-bath. After drying the same area was rewaxed, again crackled, and immersed in a red dye-bath. The result is very pleasing, a purple border with blue, red and purple crackle forming a delicate net work over the white center.    [Illustration: BATIKED HANDKERCHIEF {p. 74}]     CHAPTER IV  BATIKS AND OTHER ILLUMINATED TEXTILES   Applied design has been the stabilizing factor in art education. It gives to art education a tangible reason for its place in the schools. It injects into every individual and class project the element of discipline that comes through being required to think in terms of definite mediums of expression.    [Illustration: {BATIK DESIGN} {p. 75}]  The greatest emphasis, and for this reason perhaps the greatest success, has been its application in the field of costume designing and interior decoration. Batiks lay a just claim to having enriched this phase of art expression. A new creative and illuminating touch has been given to draperies, covers, cushions, scarfs, wall hangings, and costumes.  The following pages illustrate and explain a number of these illuminated objects.    [Illustration: PORTION OF A JAVANESE SARONG {p. 76}]   SARONGS  The sarong decorated with peacocks and vines is characteristic. The colors are red, blue and light yellow.   END PAPERS  The decoration of the end papers in this book is taken from the design of a very fine old sarong. The material is cotton. It has the quality and texture of the rarest batiks. The dyeing is vegetable indigo. Some of the units were perhaps applied with a tjap, but much of the waxing was done with single and double spouted tjantings. The ground color is a soft gray yellow.   SARONG DETAILS  The batik details shown on page 95 are all taken from old sarongs. The tjanting was used for all these patterns. They are excellent pieces of native craftsmanship.  The pattern on the left has a yellow gray background. The all-over dyeing is brown and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49823"],["title","Batik and Other Pattern Dyeing (#6)"],["body","dark red.  On the right the upper pattern has yellow gray in the background and brown decoration, the lower pattern has brown background and yellow gray decoration.   COSTUME JEWELRY  The band for this ornament, page 78, is made of several layers of georgette crepe picoted. It is ¾ inch wide and 1 yard long. The ornament, 1½ x 2⅜ inches, was modeled from \"petroplast,\" the modeling clay which sets without firing.    [Illustration: BATIKED RIBBON, CAMISOLE, AND COSTUME JEWELRY {p. 78}]  The silk was folded to four thicknesses. The wax was painted in a variety of interesting shapes on the white goods. Bands in red, yellow, green and orange were painted with dyes.  The petroplast was modeled smooth and the bird, flowers and pedestal were incised while the composition was still plastic. When dry it was dipped in black enamel. The outline of the bird was enameled in yellow and orange, the flowers painted in purple and blue, the pedestal in brown.  This adornment was planned to be worn as a necklace to brighten a dark costume.   COSTUME DECORATION  The costume decoration, page 53, was batiked on yellow taffeta silk.  The design was painted in with wax. The piece outside the decoration was covered with wax. The material was dipped in a dark brown bath and finished by ironing between layers of newspapers.  It is suitable for a vest or for millinery.   BLOUSES  1. The blouse, page 84, with a rose design was made of white crepe-de-chene.  The outline of the decoration was waxed, and the roses and leaves painted conventionally. The borders and spaces were painted in wax. The border of the red was painted between waxed outlines.  The fabric was dyed blue, and finished with petroplast beads enameled in red.    [Illustration: BATIKED BLOUSE {p. 80}]  2. The detail of a georgette crepe blouse, page 87, with a dark background and all-over decoration in gold, is a suitable design for yardage. The piece was first dyed gold, and the pattern stopped out with wax. The dye-bath for the ground color was purple black.  3. The pongee silk blouse, page 80, is a good standard for service and artistic merit.  The leaves, stems and lower border decoration were painted in wax on the natural color of the cloth.  The piece was dyed blue, then the flowers and upper border were stopped out. A brown bath followed, giving as the final color a dark bronze. The blouse was belted with a bronze silk cord.  4. The crepe-de-chene blouse, page 82, has a rich green background with an after crackle in an orange bath.  The edges, sleeves and neck are decorated with a narrow orange and gray band.  Petroplast beads decorated to harmonize with the color of the silk, a brown cord girdle weighted with these ornaments, picoted edges, and stitchery of silk floss the same color as the cord finish a garment of great beauty and dignity.   SILK LINING  The crepe-de-chene lining illustrated on page 85 has a grayed yellow-green background. The flower motif has yellow, black and orange in the center, red and purple in the outer parts. The bud is red and purple. The stem and leaves are blue. These colors were painted within wax outlines.    [Illustration: BATIKED BLOUSE WITH PETROPLAST ORNAMENTS {p. 82}]  There were eight yards of this lining. When rolling the waxed goods on the frame, a paper was rolled up with the material to prevent the wax from sticking.  The lining was used for a full length blue serge cape. After two dry cleanings, this garment was still fresh and beautiful.   CAMISOLE  1. The camisole, page 78, was made from a 14 x 36-inch piece of white crepe-de-chene. Half-inch purple ribbon, seven-eighths yard long, made the shoulder straps; a narrow purple ribbon gathered the top.  2. The design in yellow, brown and green was painted within wax outlines. The dyeing was in purple, the crackle penetrating the design.  3. The top was finished with double hemstitching.   BATIKED RIBBON  The ribbon illustrated, page 78, was turquoise blue satin, 7½ x 36 inches.  The design was outlined and parts stopped out. The material was dyed in a blue dye-bath. The blue was stopped out in the flower shapes. The material was dyed in a yellow dye-bath. The leaves were stopped out. The material was dyed in a red dye-bath.  The decoration of the finished ribbon was turquoise blue, gray-blue and yellow-green. The background was dark olive green.    [Illustration: AN ILLUMINATED BLOUSE WITH PETROPLAST BEADS {p. 84}]    [Illustration: A CAPE LINING {p. 85}]   INTERIOR DECORATION   DOOR CURTAIN  The door curtain illustration, page 75, is a symbolic composition with a mystic wall and gate, and imaginary birds and a tree.  The color scheme is a black background, blue and purple tree, yellow and blue birds, a purple and orange fence and gate, and a foreground of blue, yellow and green.  The design was painted directly upon a good quality of silk, without guiding lines or waxed outlines. The painting was done very rapidly, perhaps in ten minutes.  The material was dipped several times, once in yellow, twice in red (more red was added to the dye-bath after the first red was exhausted), twice in the blue which was developed the same as the red, and at last back into the yellow. When the dyeing was completed the piece was thoroughly rinsed and the wax was removed.  The crackle caused through successive dyeings, the soft edges of the outlines and the blending of the background with the shapes freed the piece from the criticism often invited where colors are painted in large areas.   TABLE COVER  This design, page 89, (21 x 25 inches) consists of two conventional dogs adapted from the Chinese. The well-chosen colors are yellow and orange, with accents of black. The border decoration was painted in light green. Large and small spots suggest the use of the tjanting. The darkest values are reseda green.    [Illustration: BATIK DETAIL FROM BLOUSE {p. 87}]  The fabric was first dyed yellow. The dogs and spacing of borders were drawn in fine wax outlines. The dogs were painted orange, with small shapes of black for accents, and covered with wax. The material was then dipped in green dye, rinsed and dried.  The decoration for the border was drawn in wax, and the background for the dogs was also waxed.  In developing a pattern where so much drawing is needed, pains should be taken to retain the original outlines of the drawing. If the design is too much obscured after successive dippings, the drawing should again be transferred. The outline for the dogs and spacings for borders were saved by waxing. The green decoration on the border was not painted until after two dippings.  The crackle, tying the whole decoration, is even and adds beauty to the design.  The beauty of this batik lies in its fitness, its variety of line, its pleasing space relations and its good color scheme.   ELEPHANT DECORATION  The elephant decoration illustrated on page 91 (27 x 25 inches) was done on white taffeta. The frame was made of two-inch basswood with a narrow gilt-edge moulding for a finish. The decoration on the frame was batiked.  The elephant, with its decoration and border, was outlined in wax.    [Illustration: BATIKED TABLE COVER {p. 89}]  The vertical stripes numbered from left to right were: yellow (1-3-5-7-9); orange (2-6-10); magenta (4-8). These were painted in and covered with wax. The fabric was dipped in a dye-bath of grayed purple.  The design on the frame was painted in wax and the colors in the design reproduced from the colors in the silk. Most of the wax was removed with a knife and the balance with a gasoline wash. It was afterwards finished with a coating of wax.  This wall hanging has a few spots where the treatment was not thorough. The red stripe under the elephant's head shows unintentional breaking in the wax. Too much blue crept into many places. It cannot be emphasized too many times--before painting over the colors with wax, the colors must be dry.  This work illustrates the success of painting in rather large surfaces of color without streaks appearing and harmonizing the whole by tying together with crackle. The design of the elephant and the outside border are unusually meritorious.   \"A TABLE BEFORE ME\"  This decoration was drawn on glazed paper and pounced on white china silk, 40 x 72 inches. There was no painting of colors, the process being one of dippings only.  The design was outlined in wax. The small spottings, border lines and markings in the vine were stopped out, and the piece was dipped in a yellow dye-bath.  Through each dipping a dye record was kept by carrying a small piece of the goods through the dye-bath. After each dyeing the wax was carefully mended.    [Illustration: A WALL HANGING WITH BATIKED FRAME {p. 91}]  The bell-like flowers in bands or borders, the flowers at the foot of the vine, the body, wing, tail and lower part of the bird's legs, tendrils, dragon fly and border were stopped out, and the piece dyed orange.  The remaining bands and shapes in the flowers, inside and outside border, and tendrils were stopped out and the next dipping was blue. The background and remaining shapes were a lovely warm gray lavender.  Part of the leaves, head of the bird, upper part of the bird's legs, shapes in the foreground, and roots of the vine were stopped out. The next dyeing was blue.  The vine, remaining leaves, tendrils, the remainder of the foreground and spaces that were needed to fill in were drawn in wax.  The wax was removed from the wing and the tail of the bird and the batik dipped in a dye-bath of deep blue.  The color range in this piece includes red-orange, yellow, blue, turquoise, two shades of lavender, green and sparkles of white broken by every color, on a gray-blue background.  The work on this batik extended over a period of two weeks.   \"THE CAPTURE\"  The frontispiece is worthy of special study.  The material was white pussy willow silk, 40 x 72 inches.  A sketch of the design, 6½ x 10 inches, was made in water colors.    [Illustration: \"A TABLE"]]]
