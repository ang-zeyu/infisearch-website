However, the job I have in mind is not exactly a routine affair. True, nothing out of the way may happen. On the other hand it is possible that Jerry may be planning something very special, knowing full well that the photo planes are over there to try and find out what happened to the missing patrol. You see?\"  The Squadron Leader nodded and smiled faintly.  \"I didn't expect you to let us out of it, sir,\" he said and broadened his smile. \"Just the old hen looking out for her chicks, if you understand what I mean, sir. Rather fond of my lads, and want to keep them around as long as I can. However, I have a suggestion to make.\"  \"By all means, Markham!\" the senior officer said quickly. \"By all means. What is it?\"  \"Make it a voluntary affair, as stated in your orders, sir,\" Eighty-Four's O.C. said, \"but permit the entire Squadron to volunteer. I know every one of my chaps will be eager to go along. And if there is trouble, and I fancy there will be, then the more escort pilots there are along the safer it will be for the photo planes.\"  \"Splendid, Markham!\" Group Captain Ball cried. \"A splendid idea. Of course, that means you want to lead the Patrol?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Markham replied. \"Naturally, I wouldn't want to ... er, miss any of the fun.\"  \"I suspected as much,\" the Adastral House official said with a chuckle. \"Very well, then, Markham. We'll tackle it on that basis. I'll inform the Fifty-Fifth Bomber Command Squadron that you will serve as their escort. We'll schedule the patrol for first thing at dawn tomorrow, and....\"  \"Why not today, sir?\" Markham interrupted with an apologetic gesture. \"We've got all afternoon, and the sooner you get those pictures, the sooner you may be able to find out something ... I hope.\"  \"True,\" Group Captain Ball said. \"Quite true, Markham. On the other hand, delaying things another day may give Jerry the idea we're no longer interested in that Zone. Sort of catch him off guard, you might say. It's a chance worth taking. We jolly well might profit from it.\"  \"Yes, I see your point, sir,\" Markham said with a nod. \"And, after all, we've got a little preparing to do. Checking planes, engines, and all that sort of thing. Right you are, sir. Tomorrow morning at dawn it is.\"  \"Good!\" Group Captain Ball said. Then turning toward Dave and Freddy he continued, \"And now I have a bit of a surprise for you two chaps. In recognition of your....\"  The Air Ministry official stopped short and stared hard at Dave Dawson, who seemed not to be listening. The Yank born R.A.F. ace was gazing out the Squadron Office window with a look on his face that seemed to indicate his thoughts were a million miles away.  Group Captain Ball cleared his throat, and reached out a hand and tapped Dave on the knee.  \"Day dreaming, Dawson?\" he asked sharply. \"All this sort of bores you, eh?\"  Dave jumped as though he had been shot, swallowed hard, and went beet red to the roots of his hair.  \"No, sir, of course not!\" he said hastily. \"I was.... Well, I was just thinking, sir.\"  \"Really?\" the senior officer murmured. \"Mind telling us about what, Dawson?\"  Dave turned even a shade redder, and avoided Group Captain Ball's steady gaze.  \"About the photo patrol you're planning, sir,\" he finally said after a couple of false starts. \"It seems to me.... That is.... Well, I mean sir, I....\"  \"Come, come, Dawson!\" the Adastral House official jacked him up as he stumbled. \"Just what do you mean, anyway?\"  Dave hesitated, then took a deep breath, and sort of squared his shoulders.  \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" he said, \"but I'm not in favor of your plan at all. Frankly, I don't think you'd gain any more from it than you have from the others. To tell the truth, I've got a hunch it would be a waste of time, and perhaps a loss of pilots and planes!\"     CHAPTER SEVEN  _Dave's Plan_   Had a Nazi Stuka come plowing down through the Squadron Office roof and lighted on Markham's desk the stunned amazement of the others would not have been any greater. Freddy gulped and looked actually scared stiff. Markham, Group Captain Ball, and Colonel Trevor sat up a bit in their chairs and gaped pop-eyed at each other. It was the Air Ministry official who first found his tongue.  \"Well, bless me, rather!\" he breathed. \"In my time I've been told a thing or two right to my face, but.... Well, I must say, Dawson, that once you get started you get right to the point. So my plan is a bit of a wash-out in your mind, eh?\"  At that moment Dave would have given a lot if a great big hole had opened up in the floor so that he could jump into it and disappear completely. However, no hole opened up, and so he stuck to his guns.  \"Yes, sir,\" he said doggedly. \"I know I'm speaking out of turn, but you asked me, sir. So I gave you a truthful answer.\"  \"The truth is always welcomed, of course,\" Group Captain Ball said a bit stiffly. \"Supposing, though, instead of wasting time defending yourself, you explain why there would be no sense in carrying out such a stupid mission?\"  \"Just a minute!\" Dave said as his cheeks got hot. \"I didn't say the mission was stupid, sir. I didn't say, either, that carrying it out would be a waste of time. I meant that carrying it out _as planned_ would be a waste of time, in my opinion.\"  \"Why?\"  It was Colonel Trevor who shot out the single word. He had leaned farther forward in his chair, and was regarding Dave not out of hostile eyes, but out of eyes that showed frank curiosity, and an earnest desire to learn the truth.  \"Because of what's already happened, Colonel,\" Dave replied. \"Look at it this way. Countless photo patrols were made over the terrain of Zone K Dash Twenty-Four. Each time Jerry planes were encountered and there was a scramble or two. At first the pictures didn't show anything of interest. Then suddenly they showed a lot of crazy changes in a certain area. Finally, the pictures gave every indication that that certain area had been completely evacuated. And lastly, a photo flight that went over at night failed to return. You follow me, sir?\"  \"Yes,\" the Intelligence officer grunted. \"But you're only giving a case history of what's happened. We know all about that.\"  \"Why did it happen?\" Dave shot right back at him. \"If you want my opinion I think it's because the Nazis _knew all the time_ what we were up to. They saw our bombers upstairs, but no eggs were dropped. They saw our bombers circling around over the area day after day, and still no bombs came down. The Jerry fighter pilots tangled with our fighters, and the photo ships still stuck to their job. What in the world do you think the Nazis on the ground were imagining? That we were practicing formation flying or something? The heck they did! They knew darn well that we were taking pictures, and more pictures. And not being exactly dumb, they did the logical thing!\"  The ghost of a smile quivered at the corners of Colonel Trevor's mouth. Even Markham and Group Captain Ball were having trouble keeping a straight face. The straight from the shoulder honesty of the young Yank was not exactly an every day occurrence in British Army life, and they were a bit more amused than they were shocked.  \"And what was the logical thing for the Nazis to do?\" the Intelligence officer eventually asked quietly.  \"Kid us along, of course!\" Dave cried, warming up to his subject. \"Pull the old razzle-dazzle on us, so that we wouldn't know where we were from a three dollar hat. Don't you get me?\"  \"I was quite a while in the States,\" Colonel Trevor said with a chuckle, \"but I'm afraid I didn't quite pick up all of your American slang expressions. What do you mean by what you've just said, Dawson?\"  Dave grinned, and blushed slightly.  \"Sorry, sir,\" he said. \"I sort of shoved into high gear without realizing it. I mean, I ... well, anyway, I'm sure Jerry knew what we were up to all the time, so he purposely made things all the more confusing. Matter of fact, I wouldn't be at all surprised but what he kidded us along step by step hoping that we would send over that night patrol.\"  \"What?\" Group Captain Ball exploded in a loud voice. \"Led us along? What in the world do you mean by that? I think you've gone balmy, my lad. Of all the rot!\"  \"Maybe so, sir,\" Dave said evenly and held up two fingers. \"But there are two things _we_ don't know. One, what the new Nazi secret weapon is all about. And, two, what happened to that night picture patrol. Correct, sir?\"  \"Unfortunately, yes,\" the other grunted backing down a little. \"But what's that got to do with what the Nazis did? I mean, all this kidding along, as you express it.\"  \"You're pinning me down kind of tight, sir,\" Dave said with a half grin. \"That part is just a hunch that sticks in my craw. I mean, I've got the hunch that there was one thing the _Nazis didn't know_. For certain, I mean.\"  Group Captain Ball groaned and threw up his hands.  \"My word!\" he cried. \"More blasted riddles! Come to the point, Dawson. What in the world _do_ you mean?\"  Dave hesitated a moment and then gave it to them straight.  \"The new Nazi secret weapon,\" he said. \"The Jerries were not certain how successful it would be against an air invasion. So they _tried it out_!\"  As Dave's echo faded away into silence not a man uttered a sound. Not a man hardly so much as breathed. The exploding verbal bomb shell had driven home a possible truth that not one of them had even so much as considered. Not even so much as suspected of existence.  \"By George!\" Group Captain Ball finally breathed in an awed tone. \"The chap has hit upon something. No doubt about it at all. It's quite possible, this hunch of his. Quite, indeed. The blasted Nazis have been playing games with me to serve their own purpose. Dawson! I apologize for being a bit rude awhile back. You're quite right. I'm afraid we have been wasting our time. And would waste more to make another photo patrol.

He was sauntering towards the spaceport, but he was in no hurry. He had allowed himself plenty of time to breathe the fresh spring air, to listen to the myriad of sounds made by his fellow men, and to revel in the grand freedom that being out in the open gave him. Soon enough he would be breathing canned air, pungent with the odor of compressor oil and the tang of the greenery used to replenish the oxygen, unable to walk freely more than a few dozen steps, and unable to see what lies beyond his viewports.  Occasionally his eyes looked along the low southern sky towards Alpha Centauri. Proxima, of course, could not be resolved by the naked eye, much less the stinking little overheated mote that rotated about Proxima. Obviously unfit for human life and patently incapable of spawning life of its own, it was Paul Grayson's destination, and would be his home for a few days or a few weeks depending entirely upon whether things went good or bad.  Only during the last four out of two thousand millions of years of its life had this planet been useful. Man needed a place to stand; not to move the earth with Archimedes's lever but to survey the galaxy. Proxima Centauri I was the only planet in the trinary and as bad as it was, it was useful for a space station.  In an hour, Paul Grayson would be locked in a capsule of metal hurling himself through space towards Proxima I. He was looking forward to ten days cooped up in a spacecraft of the type furnished by the Bureau of Astrogation to its engineers which was a far cry from the sumptuous craft run by the Big Brass. His confines would be lined with functional scientific equipment; his air supply would be medically acceptable but aesthetically horrible; and his vision limited to the cabin, for beyond the viewports would be only the formless, endless, abysmal blackness of absolutely nothing while the ship mounted into multiples of the speed of light.  Then days in a building filled to the dome with power equipment and radio gear; timing mechanism and recorders; and a refrigerator set-up that struggled with the awesome heat poured into Proxima I by its close-by luminary but which succeeded only in lowering the temperature to the point where the potting compound in the transformers did not run out, where the calibrating resistors would not change their values, where the recording machines would still make a record.  And then again more days in the ship before it returned to earth. Call it thirty days and understand why Paul Grayson sauntered along killing time in the fresh air before taking off.  Paul grinned. Four years ago he had arrived a full hour early and wasted the hour in the smelly ship instead of filling his lungs with clean fresh air. Never again. He would arrive a full five minutes before check-in time.  He heard some radio music, its tone stripped of high frequencies from its passage through the slit of a partially-opened window. He sniffed the air and laughed because someone was cooking corned beef and cabbage. Then he was out of the range of the radio music. Paul liked music. He hummed a tune as he walked, and then as the fancy struck him, he started to sing. It was faint singing; it would not have carried more than a few feet, but it sufficed for Paul. It was a refrain from an early atomic-age ballad:      \"_Round and round and round go the deuterons     Round and round the magnet swings them     Round and round and round go the deuterons     Smack! In the target goes the ion beam!_\"  Paul stopped his song because the interesting click of high heels on the sidewalk pointed to the approach of someone who might view _a cappella_ singing as an indication of inebriation.  She was coming towards him, walking on the same side of the sidewalk. Her step was quick and lithe, and the slight breeze outlined her frock against her body, revealing and at the same time concealing just enough to quicken the pulse and awaken the interest. Paul was thirty and unmarried, and experienced enough to catalogue her shrewdly.  No crude attempt at pick-up would work on this woman. She was sure of herself and obviously could not want for admirers. It would take careful strategy over a period of time to get to first base with a woman like her; an inept campaigner would be called out on strikes. And Paul Grayson had to be on the way to Centauri within the hour, which automatically eliminated the initial step in any plausible scheme to wrangle an introduction.  Paul Grayson grinned ruefully. It seemed to him that when he had hours to spend and nothing to do, the streets were barren of presentable women while the most interesting specimens of womanhood smiled and offered their charms when he was en route towards some schedule that could not be delayed.  This was woman enough to make a man forget his timetables--almost.  She came forward, her face lighted by the street lamp that Paul had just passed. Blue-eyed and fair-skinned, her hurried route was on collision course with his and with a minute shake of his head because he had neither the time nor the inclination to attempt anything as crude as striking up an acquaintance by barring her path, Paul angled his course aside.  She angled too.  \"Hello,\" she said brightly. \"I thought you'd be along sooner.\"  Paul Grayson gulped. Obviously she mistook him for someone else and a faint feeling of jealousy ran through him for the lucky man who owned her affections. The street lamp behind him must have cast heavy shadows across his face making identification difficult. He opened his mouth to explain away the mistake, but the girl came up to him, hardly slackening her pace until the last possible moment. Then instead of speaking, Paul found his parted mouth met by hers. Her lips were warm. Her arms came around him in a quick embrace, and his arms instinctively closed about her waist.  Paul kissed back, cheerfully accepting the pleasure of the error with a sort of devilish glee.  Then he stepped back.  \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"that I am not the guy you thought I was.\"  She looked up at him with a blink. Her expression changed to surprise, and then her mouth opened in a scream as her eyes flicked away from him and centered over his left shoulder.  Paul started to whirl, but someone dropped the north pole on the back of his skull. It chilled him completely. Her scream rang in his ears as he fell forward. Vaguely he felt the silk of her dress against his outstretched hands, and then against his cheek just before the sidewalk rose up to grind against his face. Something pulled at his coat.  Then he felt nothing more. Only the frightened scream of the woman that rang in his ears, shrill, angry, fearful, and never ending----  ----until Paul realized that the siren wail was not her scream but the ringing of his own ears, and that the girl was sitting a-sprawl on the sidewalk with his head between her thighs. She was rubbing the nape of his neck with her fingertips, quietly erasing the pain bit by bit.  The threshold of ringing in his ears diminished and his field of vision increased as the darting lights went away, and Paul Grayson then could hear the sound of running feet and the babble of voices.  \"What happened?\"  \"This man was clipped by a thug.\"  \"You saw it?\" came the voices in a mad garble of scrambled speeches.  \"Right in front of my eyes.\"  The babble broke into many and varied subjects. Curiosity, both morbid and Samaritan; anger both righteous and superficial, but both directed at the things that make such happenings possible; suggestions both sensible and absurd, and offers both welcome and ridiculous.  Paul groaned and tried to lift his hand to the raw spot on his chin where the sidewalk had removed some hide.  The woman looked down at him and smiled in a wan, apprehensive manner. \"You're all right?\"  Paul struggled to sit up and made it with her help. The wave of pain rose and localized in his head at about forty degrees right latitude. It made him want to carry his head at an angle with his neck ducked down below the level of the knot of pain. Hands helped him to his feet, led him across the sidewalk while he became stronger by the moment.  He shook his head to clear it and winced as the motion caused the knot of pain to vibrate nastily. \"What happened?\" he asked in a quavering voice. It sounded like someone else's voice to him, and surprised at the sound of it he repeated the question. It still sounded like someone else's voice and while he was wondering if his voice would sound like that for the rest of his life, the girl explained what had happened.  Paul missed most of it, but then asked another question: \"Did you see him?\"  \"No,\" she said. Her voice was regretful, yet tinted with a dash of amusement. \"He sort of rose out of the shadow behind you--you're a tall man, you know. All I saw was a ragged silhouette. He "]]]
