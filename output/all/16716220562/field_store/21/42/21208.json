Eddie's mother was cool and wary.  \"Have you information as to the whereabouts of Dr. Mitchell Prell, Mrs. Dukas?\" she was asked. \"We know that the last Moon rocket landed with him aboard.\"  Before she could lie Eddie blurted, \"He was here all that day. He's gone now. He didn't make his destination very clear.\"  Eileen Dukas's eyes widened with panic and surprise. She had expected Eddie to be more discreet.  \"You have no right to question my son!\" she stated coldly.  \"Mrs. Dukas,\" she was informed, \"when there is an investigation of the deaths of two hundred million people, we have more than the right to question anybody.\"  Young Ed was scared. But he felt some of the hero-impulse. Or the desire to follow faithfully the instructions of his idol, Uncle Mitch.  \"If you psych my memory, what little I know will come clearer than if I just told it,\" he challenged.  This was done forthwith, out in the police car parked in the street. When the helmet of the apparatus was removed from Eddie's head, the police had certain comments of Mitchell Prell's to study. Possibly they could puzzle out some of their hidden meaning. But this couldn't have satisfied them very much.  The next day the letter Prell had mentioned arrived. At least it could be assumed that it was the one. Uncle Mitch had managed to make one step of his purpose anyway! Under the heading of \"Vital Section, Schaeffer Laboratories,\" it said:       MRS. DUKAS:       _Will you kindly report at your earliest convenience to the      above section. This is of greatest importance. Please bring      your son._       _Sincerely_,       DR. M. BART  Ed was both cold with tension and hot with eagerness. The following day he and his mother were in the battered City. Fire had scarred it. A boiling tidal wave had washed over portions of it. But the great building over the many subterranean levels of the Schaeffer Labs had stood firm. Quakes had not broken it down.  An elevator took them below, to that steel- and lead- and concrete-shielded place which might have resisted for a while even a noval outburst of the sun. They were requested to lie down on something like sensipsych couches. A voice--maybe Dr. Bart's--spoke to them from a swift-gathering dream: \"Think about Jack Dukas. Your husband. Your father. Things he said. His manner of speech. His expressions, gestures, temperament, likes and dislikes, hobbies, jokes, skills. The people that he knew. Their faces and mannerisms. As many of them as possible will be contacted and psyched like this, too. Think of his memories told to you. Think of everything ... everything ... everything....\"  For Eileen Dukas it must have been much the same as for her son. Pearly haze seemed to float inside Eddie's mind. Like a million bits of ancient news clippings always in motion, his recollections of his father seemed to burst in a thousand ever-shifting fragments within his brain. He felt an awful compulsion to recall. It sapped his strength until all consciousness faded away. Yet before this happened he knew that the probing would go on and on.  The next thing he knew he was sitting groggily in a pneumatic tube train, with his mother, all but exhausted, too, leaning against him. Almost as an afterthought, their own minds and bodies had been \"recorded\" there at the laboratory. They seldom exchanged questions or speculations afterward about what had happened to them. It had been a dream. Let it be a dream.     II   Life had become hard enough for Eileen Dukas and her son. While most people treated them all right--from some they even received exaggerated kindness--there was, very often, a certain disturbing expression in eyes that looked at them.  Les Payten, Eddie's friend said once, \"I promise, Ed. No more talk about your uncle from me. Finished, see? You've had enough.\"  Eddie suppressed the anger which sprang from loyalty to Mitchell Prell, for he understood Les Payten's good intentions.  At regular intervals there were police visits at the house, and questioning. \"It's partly for your protection, Mrs. Dukas,\" was one honest comment from the detectives. But Eddie sensed that there was more to it than that. Subtly, the interpretation of law had changed since the lunar blowup. It went backward, as grief sought people to blame. Catastrophe had been too big for reason or fairness. And the scapegoat himself was not around to be mobbed.  A freckle-faced brat from the Youth Center--her name, Barbara Day, had been drawn out of a hat, for of course she had no known parents--offered advice: \"You ought to go far away, Eddie, where folks don't know you. It would be better.\"  Ed knew that this was good advice. Many people were saying and shouting and whispering that too much knowledge was a dangerous possession. And Ed's uncle still represented such a thing. More than once Ed had to run fast, with some big lug chasing him. Black eyes he collected with great frequency, and delivered some, too. Still, he ached inside. It was as if Uncle Mitch were part of him.  The world began to look normal and green again. But the undercurrents of memory were still there. And Ed Dukas began to answer hate with hate, though he didn't like to.  There was a crowd of young toughs with rocks to throw, in front of the house one night. \"This is the place,\" Eddie heard one of them say. \"Both my parents are gone. And the bums that live here were in on the reason.\"  Ed had seen the boy around before: Ash Parker. Now the rocks flew for a while, and Ed and his mother crouched behind locked doors. There might have been a lynching, except that Les Payten found a neighbor with a tear-gas vial and some other neighbors with sharp tongues and courage.  It was the final straw, however. \"Will we have to leave, Eddie?\" his mother asked.  \"It's best,\" he growled. \"But I'll be back!\"  Next day the house was being boarded up. Packing began even before the colonial travel permits were prepared.  It was goodbye to Les Payten and Barbara Day, and the newly ringed planet, Earth, with its billions of inhabitants and its great shops that still worked to give the whole solar system to mankind and maybe a segment of the larger universe as well. The pattern of the future seemed set, and specialists still didn't think that there was any real reason to make a change. In fact, they denied that any change was possible. Nobody would give up the threshold of immortality, once it was gained. Nor would they relinquish other triumphs that could bring idleness and decay if they were not used to accomplish bigger and bigger tasks. So, even the fearful ones were caught in the rushing current of the times.  Ed Dukas was soon on a crowded liner. Because she might need him, he kept close to his mother. Around them were other colonists--young graduates from technical schools, newlyweds and people who were physically young, too, though they were fresh from the rejuvenation vats. They were the aged, awed by another lifetime before them.  The liner blasted off. A week later it landed on an asteroid of middling size. The Dukases were assigned to one of a group of trim cottages that were not even all alike. Under the great glass roof, which kept in the synthetic air, the new gardens and fruit trees were already growing. And in coiled tubes of clear plastic filled with water, circulated green algae from which almost any kind of basic food could be made.  To Eddie it was a satisfying dip into space that he had so much anticipated. Amid great heaps of steel and plastic and house parts and atomic machines to maintain a normal temperature so far from the sun, life went on. Eddie's mother worked in the office of a shop for robot machines. He worked too--when and where he could--when he was not at school.  There was a little more of peace, for a while anyway. There was the usual psychological treatment to subdue possible devils of the lunar catastrophe which might remain in his mind. There were sports and an artificial lake to swim in with his companions. However, Ed Dukas was wary of making deep friendships.  He was then a sullen, overly matured youth of thirteen, earnest about everything he did--for he knew that the years ahead were grimly earnest. Carefully he kept up with the reports in scientific journals: about the laying of the keel of the first star ship on a minute asteroid with only a number and no name. Harwell was in charge. The propellant would be pure radiant energy--the best of them all; energy so concentrated that it would be truly massive and hurled at the speed of light, which was not remarkable, since it _would_ be light, far more intense per unit area than the noval explosion of a star!  This was by no means the only major advance that had been accomplished and was reported. Technological progress was steady in all fields, across the board, making a solid front. Others of its facets also had a special appeal to Ed Dukas. Biological science, in its newest interpretations, he knew to be the most important of these. Now it was no longer just simple rejuvenation--restoring rusty organs. It was a thing that could start from a single cell, in warm, sticky fluids, giving rebirth to something that had already been. And it had a further development--bringing the same results but more swiftly and easily, and with different, far more rugged flesh. It was frightening and fascinating. Knowing was like feeling the shadow of a demon or an angel.         *       *       *       *       *  Ed Dukas and his mother spent four years on their asteroid. Then one day a letter fluttered in her hand. And she seemed not to know whether to look happy or terrified. She did not show her son the letter.  \"We've had enough of being here,\" she stated. \"We're going home.\"  So they went back across the millions of miles. They cleaned up the house, on which obscene insults had been scribbled in chalk. On two successive days Eddie was jumped by gangs. He fought free and escaped. But on the third evening he was cornered. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50063"],["title","People Minus X (#6)"],["body","time Ash Parker was the ringleader. Ed battled like a bobcat, but eight opponents were too many. He was flat on his back, and they were kicking him. His own blood was in his mouth. What might happen when he blacked out was anybody's guess. Once, before medical knowledge had advanced to where it was, it would have been murder for sure.  Somebody intervened--a big guy in a gray business suit who had come striding along the block with an eager attention.  He didn't say anything at first. He just collared the toughs, two at a time in swift succession, and thrust them away.  Eddie staggered up and faced his benefactor, intent on giving him sincere thanks. \"Mister ... I ...\"  \"Hello, Eddie!\" the man said, chuckling. \"I see you turned out hardy. Seventeen you'd be now.\"  Young Ed Dukas heard the voice and looked at the face. He stiffened. Then he made a statement in a flat tone that sounded very formal and unemotional, which it was not: \"Sir, you're my father.\"  The man nodded. \"Just off the assembly line, pal. The same guy--because you and your mother, and some other people, remembered what I was like. There was no record of me or of my mind. So, okay, they made one, fella. From the memories of me left in other minds. Thanks, Eddie.\"  \"Thanks?\" Ed Dukas said in a choked voice.  Bloody and dirty, he stepped forward. Father and son clung to each other. It was a moment of great triumph.  Ed's mind pictured filaments, as fragile at first as pink spiderweb but already outlining a human shape, held suspended in a kind of jelly--growing there, forming according to a record. Now even the record could be synthesized. It seemed like real freedom from death at last.  Ash Parker had not fled. Now he spoke, sounding awed, \"Jeez, Mr. Dukas. I didn't believe it. Maybe my folks can come back, too.\"  \"Your parents _will_ come back,\" Jack Dukas affirmed. \"I am the first 'memory man' to be resurrected. Among those killed who had had their bodies and minds recorded as was recommended, about a hundred thousand are alive again, as I think you know. Millions more are in process. One way or another, by record or by the memories of others, in flesh of the old kind or the new, almost everyone will return.\"  Ed felt his father's hand. As far as he could tell, it _was_ of flesh. Yet it could be something else; Ed nearly trembled with excitement as his eager wonder and primitive dread of the strange battled inside him. He thought again of Mitchell Prell's first samples of vitaplasm.  \"Of which flesh are you, Dad?\" Ed asked anxiously.  His father studied him there in the twilight of the day, while the silvery ring of lunar wreckage brightened in the sky.  \"The old kind, Eddie,\" he answered.  \"I'm glad,\" Ed said, feeling greatly relieved, a reaction which he knew was odd for one who loved the thought of coming miracles.  Jack Dukas sighed as if he had escaped a terrible fate. \"So am I glad, pal,\" he said. \"I guess I was favored by family connections.\" Here he paused, but his wink meant Uncle Mitch. \"However,\" he continued, \"the old flesh takes so much longer. That's why in many cases it won't be used. There must be thousands of androids already among us, living like everybody else. Since personal concerns are involved, statistics are kept rather confidential. These synthetic people have organs the same as we have. And you can't recognize them just by looking. Only they're thirty per cent heavier, stronger, and they don't tire. There was a thought, once, that robots would make human beings obsolete and replace them. Sorry, Eddie. Why be gruesome at a time like this? Let's patch you up and then find your mother.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Young Ed Dukas was happier than he had ever been before. For quite a while he found peace. Maybe that was true of most of humanity now--for the past three or four years at least. There was no sharp delineation of an interval before the smokes of doubt began to come back.  Les Payten was still around. And Barbara Day continued to live at the Youth Center on the hill. Often the three would meet. Their childhood was behind them. Barbara Day's freckles had faded. Her dark hair had a coppery glint. A promise of beauty had begun to blossom. And her talk expressed many whimsical thoughts.  \"We all know each other, Eddie,\" she once said. \"So don't be offended. I sometimes think that you wonder whether your father is really the same person that he was--whether he ever could be more than a careful duplicate.\"  Les Payten frowned. \"You're speaking to me, too, Babs,\" he pointed out. \"I also have a 'memory father.' He's good to me, and mostly I like him. But sometimes I get scared, though I don't always know why.\"  Ed's skin tingled. \"Could I be myself now and still be myself in another body, years later? Could there ever be two of me--truly--constructed exactly the same? I don't deny such a thing. I simply don't know.\"  But Ed Dukas continued to wonder about his father. There were several occasions when his dad was supposed to recognize certain people, casually encountered in the street. For they knew him.  Ed was present on one of these occasions. \"Sorry, friend,\" Jack Dukas apologized to a burly, jovial man. \"I guess they forgot to put a picture of you inside my head.\"  Les Payten's father was also subtly different from his original--though in a somewhat different way. The change was even very dimly apparent in his face. He had once been a big, easy-going, timid soul, nagged by his wife. Now his features bore a hint of brutality. He walked with a slight swagger. He did not roar, but the aura of power was there.  Ed's mother explained the change to his father: \"Memory seems not always to match facts, Jack. Mrs. Payten fooled herself into believing that Ronald Payten used to be a bully. So she even fooled Schaeffer's mind-machines. And lo! Ronald Payten _is_ a bully now, as far as she is concerned. No, don't worry about her too much, Jack. She may even like being pushed around.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the months that passed, from out on an asteroid came the step-by-step reports of the building of the first huge star ship. At home, one by one, old acquaintances--or was it just their reasonable facsimiles?--reappeared. Gradually most of the dead of the lunar blowup were restored to life--except for certain scientists who remained unforgiven.  But a new type of population was creeping into the fabric of human society. Its humanness, in an old sense, could be debated. Its first quiet intrusion was marked by an awe that faded into a shrug; it began to be accepted casually and somewhat dully, as most past novelties had been accepted before. Foresight could extend into tomorrow, but its pictures remained not quite real. The skills of cool, clear thinking, which education tried to impart in an era that needed it so much, fell short again. No doubt it should have been remembered that the shift from inattention to unreasonable panic can often be swift.  Even young Ed Dukas, though dedicated in his heart to New and Coming Things, sometimes lost sight of these deeper concerns because of his lighter interests. Without much help from art, Barbara Day turned out to be beautiful. She had a pair of suitors automatically. Ed could have had his stocky frame lengthened. Les Payten could have had his big ears trimmed. But young men often frown on the vanity of tampering with one's appearance. Sometimes there is even a certain pride in minor ugliness.  They all had their dates, their dancing, their canoe rides--traditional pleasures, inherited from generations past. And they had the age-old problems of youth approaching adulthood. But now, for them and for their increasingly complex civilization, there was a new problem--vitaplasm, which could be grown like flesh, though faster, impressed with a shape, personality and memories. It was said that 30 per cent of those who died in the explosion of the Moon lab were brought back in this firmer, cheaper medium. But its use did not stop here. For one thing, there were certain adventurous persons, alive and healthy, who changed the character of their bodies willfully.  One fact some might forget: there were other dead from years before, but remembered and still loved--parents, grandparents. Besides, there were historical characters--Washington, Lincoln, Edison, Cleopatra.  Possibly Joe Doakes could awaken from extinction, puzzled, wondering, frightened, but finding himself at least superficially the same, eating much the same food, enjoying much the same things. Then something super in his body would dawn on him, scaring him more or making him exultant. But it all seemed good at first glance, so a joyful world forgot its times of suspicion, even against the warnings of specialists, and released the new processes to almost any operator who could construct the needed equipment.  The solar system was big; the universe, optimistically promised, seemed endless. There was plenty of room. And the task of bringing back just those who had perished with the Moon was enormous and slow. So in cellars and out-of-the-way places countless biological technicians tried their skill. They could not have made the grade at all if they were stupid, and their results, generally, were good.  The various Julius Caesars and Michelangelos really came into being as novelties, side-show pieces. All were reasonable likenesses, physically. From existing minds such traits and skills as each was supposed to possess could be copied more or less accurately. But none of the pseudo-great amounted to very much. They enjoyed a brief popularity; then, assuming the costumes and customs of a changed world, they sank into nonentity among the populace. Like most of those of the new flesh, they kept this secret as if by intuitive prudence. The many people restored in normal protoplasm were less reticent.  That there were androids around him, known, suspected and unrecognized as such, was a thrilling"]]]
