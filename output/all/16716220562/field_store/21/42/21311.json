So the devil rose up in rebellion against God, and was cast down with all who put up their heads for him\" (\"Compendium,\" page 285).  Advantage of Having a Body.--Our prophet likewise affirms: \"At the first organization in heaven we were all present, and saw the Savior chosen and appointed, and the plan of salvation made, and we sanctioned it. We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man, and when cast out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine, showing that he would prefer a swine's body to having none. All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not\" (Ibid, page 288).  Testimony of Moses.--The following passages from our sacred writings will here find place:  \"And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying--Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.  \"But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.  \"Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power: by the power of mine Only Begotten I caused that he should be cast down;  \"And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.\" (Moses 4:1-4.)  Testimony of Abraham.--Still more comprehensive are the appended paragraphs of a similar glorious revelation:  \"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;  \"And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.   \"And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;  \"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;  \"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon: and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate: and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and ever.  \"And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.  \"And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate: and, at that day, many followed after him.\" (Book of Abr. 3:22-28.)  Truth Speaks for Itself.--What a sublime presentation! What a wealth of doctrine! What a wonderful scope of prophecy! The whole divine scheme for human progress revealed at a glance! Surely the Book of Abraham, whose authenticity has recently been assailed by Christian scholars, and defended by \"Mormon\" writers and speakers, can stand upon its own merits in refutation of any argument brought against it as a divine record. Who but God could reveal such principles as this marvelous book contains? Who but one inspired of heaven could teach them in so pure a spirit and in such majestic terms? Truth--eternal truth--speaks for itself: it is not dependent upon books or translators. These are but some of the means used in making it known to the world. It is not limited to time and place. Whether in the catacombs of Egypt, or in the mounds of America, whether spoken anciently or modernly,    \"Truth is truth, where'er 'tis found,   On Christian or on heathen ground.\"  \"Mormon\" Philosophy.--Note the sound philosophy of this revelation--the divine proposition to \"make an earth,\" not out of nothing--an absurdity put forth by Christian theologians in their teachings relative to the creation--but out of \"materials\" already in existence, eternal spirit and eternal matter, as never-ending as space and duration. Then ask yourself, reader, if the \"Mormon\" doctrine, set forth in the Book of Abraham, is not the only logical, scientific, common-sense presentation possible or conceivable in the premises.  Note also that it was the design to \"make an earth;\" the inference being that this was not the only earth that had been created, nor would it be the last.  \"And then the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth\" (Abr. 4:1).    CHAPTER V.  Creation of the Earth.  Two Creations.--There were two creations--the first spiritual, the second temporal. This truth is taught inferentially in the first and second chapters of Genesis, King James's Translation; but more plainly and pointedly in the Book of Moses, a reproduction of the Book of Genesis, revised and amplified by the spirit of revelation in Joseph the Seer. Here is the modern rendering of the passages bearing directly upon this point:  As Related in the Book of Moses.--\"And now, behold, I say unto you, that these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that I, the Lord God, made the heaven and the earth.  \"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air;  \"But I, the Lord God, spake, and there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.  \"And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.\" (Moses 3:4-7.)  Adam's Incarnation.--In the Book of Abraham the incarnation of Adam is thus described:  \"And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man's spirit) and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul\" (Abr. 5:7).  Plurality of Worlds.--Regarding this earth and other creations, the Lord said to Moses:  \"And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.  \"And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many.  \"But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.\"  * * * * * * * * * * *  \"And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine.  \"And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof, even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works; neither to my words.  \"For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\"--Moses 1:33-39.  Purposes of Earth Life.--God's purpose, primarily, in placing man upon the earth, is to give him a body, a mortal tabernacle, which is rendered immortal through death and the resurrection. The spirit and the body constitute the soul. It is the soul that is redeemed from the grave (D&C 88:15,16). It is the soul that goes on to perfection. Man is here also for experience, that he may advance from stage to stage of growth and development, approximating nearer and nearer to the divine ideal voiced by the Savior: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\"--Matthew 5:48.  Man on Probation.--There is still another purpose in man's mortal existence, and it is referred to in the Book of Abraham, where the Creator, after announcing to \"those who were with him\" the proposed making of an earth \"whereon these may dwell,\" says: \"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command.\" Thus we are shown that man while here is on probation, that he may demonstrate his worthiness to inherit the great things held in reserve for the righteous.    CHAPTER VI.  Elect of Elohim.

A stature mingling strength with grace,   Of meek though God-like mien;   The glory of whose countenance   Outshone the noonday sheen.   Whiter his hair than ocean spray,   Or frost of Alpine hill.   He spake;--attention grew more grave,   The stillness e'en more still.    \"Father!\"--the voice like music fell,   Clear as the murmuring flow   Of mountain streamlet trickling down   From heights of virgin snow.   \"Father,\" it said, \"since one must die,   Thy children to redeem,   From spheres all formless now and void,   Where pulsing life shall teem:    \"And mighty Michael foremost fall,   That mortal man may be;   And chosen Savior yet must send,   Lo, here am I--send me!

Freedom--man's faith, man's work, God's grace--   Must span the great gulf o'er;   Life, death, the guerdon or the doom,   Rejoice we or deplore.\"    Still rang that voice, when sudden rose   Aloft a towering form,   Proudly erect as lowering peak   'Lumed by the gathering storm;   A presence bright and beautiful,   With eye of flashing fire,   A lip whose haughty curl bespoke   A sense of inward ire:    \"Send me!\"--coiled 'neath his courtly smile   A scarce concealed disdain--   \"And none shall hence, from heaven to earth,   That shall not rise again;   My saving plan exception scorns.   Man's will?--Nay, mine alone.   As recompense, I claim the right   To sit on yonder throne!    \"Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush   Resumed and denser grew.   All eyes were turned; the general gaze   One common Magnet drew.   A moment there was solemn pause--   Listened Eternity,   While rolled from lips Omnipotent   The Father's firm decree:    \"Jehovah, thou my Messenger!   Son Ahman, thee I send;   And one shall go thy face before,   While twelve thy steps attend;   And many more on that far shore,   The pathway shall prepare,   That I, the First, the last may come,   And earth my glory share.    \"After and ere thy going down,   An army shall descend--   The host of God, and house of him   Whom I have named my friend.   Through him, upon Idumea,   Shall come, all life to leaven,   The guileless ones, the sovereign Sons,   Throned on the heights of heaven.    \"Go forth, thou Chosen of the Gods,   Whose strength shall in thee dwell!   Go down betime and rescue earth,   Dethroning death and hell,   On thee alone man's fate depends,   The fate of beings all.   Thou shalt not fail, though thou art free--   Free, but too great to fall.    \"By arm divine, both mine and thine,   The lost thou shalt restore,   And man, redeemed, with God shall be,   As God forevermore.   Return, and to the parent fold   This wandering planet bring,   And Earth shall hail thee Conqueror,   And Heaven proclaim thee King.\"    'Twas done. From congregation vast   Tumultuous murmurs rose;   Waves of conflicting sound, as when   Two meeting seas oppose;   'Twas finished. But the Heavens wept;   And still their annals tell   How one was Choice of Elohim,   O'er one who fighting fell.    (\"Elias,\" Canto III, Part One.)    The Way of Salvation.  CHAPTER I.  The Law of Obedience.  Man Helpless.--When Adam and Eve had transgressed the divine command by partaking of the forbidden fruit, it was as if the human race had fallen into a pit, from which they were powerless, by any act of their own, to emerge. They could not climb out, for they did not know how to climb; and even had they known, there was no means by which to climb. Human endeavor, unassisted, could accomplish nothing in the way of deliverance. Man in his mortal condition needed spiritual enlightenment, having forgotten all that he had previously known. In other words, he needed a ladder, that he might climb out of the pit, and that ladder was furnished in the revelation, of the Gospel of Christ. Without it there is no salvation, no exaltation. The Tower of Babel symbolizes the situation: All man's efforts to reach heaven, without divine assistance, must end in confusion and failure.  Redemption by Grace.--The gospel ladder rests upon the rock of Christ's atonement--an act of grace, a free gift from God to all mankind--the wicked as well as the righteous. All profit by it, for, as the result of that atonement, all are brought forth from the grave. And this is eminently just: Adam's posterity were consigned to death for no deed of their own doing. It is fitting, therefore, that their redemption should come unconditionally.  Salvation by Obedience.--But redemption is not salvation, nor salvation exaltation, as already explained. Men must \"work out their salvation\" (Phillipians 2:12), and gain exaltation by continuous upward striving. Salvation and exaltation, while depending primarily upon the grace of God, are also the fruits of man's acceptance of the gospel, and his steadfast adherence thereto, until it shall have done for him its perfect work. There are degrees of glory--\"many mansions\" in the great house of God, and the highest are reserved for those who render to the Master of the house the fulness of their obedience.  \"Salvation means a man's being placed beyond the power of all his enemies. * * * Until a man can triumph over death, he is not saved. * * * To get salvation we must not only do some things, but everything which God has commanded\" (\"Joseph Smith's Teachings,\" pp. 146-150).  Heaven's First Law.--\"Order is heaven's first law,\" says human wisdom. \"Not so,\" says divine inspiration, \"obedience is heaven's first law, and order follows as the result.\" [A] Without obedience, spiritual growth, eternal progress, is impossible. Says Joseph the prophet: \"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundation of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated; and when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated\" (D&C 130:20,21).  Illustrations of Obedience.--That obedience is required from those who become and remain members of the Church of Christ, should not surprise any intelligent student of political science, nor even a casual observer of the everyday life of men and nations. All governments demand from their people obedience to the laws enacted for the general welfare. Without such obedience, there would be no peace, no protection. This is readily conceded by most men as to human governments; but some people think it strange that divine government should be administered upon like principles, and for similar, though higher, ends.  A friend of mine once said to me: \"Why do I need to belong to a church, to subscribe to a creed, or to undergo any ordinance, in order to be saved? I have always been truthful, honest, virtuous, benevolent--why will this not suffice to make my peace with God and pave my way to heaven?\"  Aliens and Naturalization.--I answered on this wise: \"Let me use a comparison to illustrate the point. Suppose you were an alien, born in Great Britain, in Scandinavia, or in some other foreign land, and you came to America desiring to become a citizen of the United States. When told that you must take out citizenship papers, forswear allegiance to every foreign power, and honor and uphold the Constitution and laws of this Republic, suppose you were to reply: `Why, what is the need of all that? I am a good man, I have always done right, and am clean, moral, and upright in conduct and conversation--why is that not sufficient to entitle me to vote, to hold office, pre-empt land, and enjoy all the rights and privileges of an American freeman?' Do you think such a plea would avail? No, you do not. You see its inconsistency as quickly as would the government unto whom it might be made. You would not expect to become a citizen of the United States upon your own terms. Why, then, should you hope for admittance into God's kingdom upon any other conditions than those which the King himself has laid down?\"  Man's Proper Attitude.--Truthfulness, honesty, virtue, and benevolence are precious possessions, inestimable treasures. They enrich the soul under all conditions, outside or inside the kingdom of God; but they are not valuable enough to purchase a passport into that kingdom. We must not count upon our personal qualities, however admirable and commendable, to gain us admission into the divine presence. Man's proper attitude, as a seeker for salvation, is one of humility, not of self-righteousness. When the Pharisee and the Publican prayed in the Temple at Jerusalem, the former thanking the Lord that he was better than other men, and the latter meekly murmuring: \"God be merciful to me, a sinner,\" the Savior, pointing to the Publican, said: That man is justified, rather than the other, \"for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted\" (Luke 18:13,14).  Obedience Better Than Sacrifice.--\"Obedience is better than sacrifice.\" So said obedient Samuel to disobedient Saul. Adam's obedience in offering sacrifice without knowing why, simply because the Lord had commanded him (Moses 5:6) Abraham's obedience in offering Isaac--for the same reason--was far more precious in the sight of heaven than the sacrifice itself. In Abraham's case the will was taken "]]]
