What country is that, and who are they fighting? I don't believe I ever heard....\"  The English youth cut himself off short as Dave rolled over on the seat and collapsed with laughter. Then before Freddy could draw in breath to demand an explanation, the compartment door was rolled aside and a tall moon faced youth in the uniform of an R.A.F. flying officer stood in the doorway. Dave cut short his laughter, and both looked up into the grinning face of the man in the doorway.  \"Am I interrupting something, chaps?\" he asked in a north of England accent. \"Just passing as I heard the outburst of humor, and saw you were R.A.F., too. Name's Steffins. Heading for Coastal Command, Plymouth.\"  \"Come in, come in, Steffins,\" Dave said and moved over to make a place. \"I'm Dawson, and my son, here, is named Freddy Farmer. Don't pay any attention to those wings and D.F.C. ribbon on his tunic. He stole them.\"  \"All lies, Steffins,\" Freddy said, extending his hand. \"The truth is, Dawson's really wearing my extra tunic. Likes to put on a show, you know. Look, Dave, have you cleaned those field boots of mine, yet? And don't forget to change back into your corporal's uniform before we reach Plymouth.\"  \"Oh, you chaps going to Plymouth, too?\" Steffins asked in a delighted tone. \"By any chance is it Seventy-Four, Coastal Command? That's where I'm headed. Been up north on Lockheed Hudsons for the last two months. Got dropped in the water twice.\"  \"Yeah, we're heading for Seventy-Four, too,\" Dave said. \"We were in Sixty-Two on the west coast. Catalinas. What do they fly in Seventy-Four, anyway? Do you know?\"  Dave wasn't sure but he got the impression that Steffins flashed him a searching, puzzled look. It was gone in an instant, however.  \"Most everything, so I've been told,\" he said, \"I say, you're a Yank, aren't you?\"  \"R.A.F. for the duration, anyway,\" Dave replied with a nod. \"What was your Lockheed squadron? I know some chaps on Lockheeds up North.\"  Steffins seemed to hesitate, but perhaps it was only to draw air into his lungs.  \"Squadron One Hundred and Twenty,\" he said. \"A fairly new outfit. Squadron Leader Clancy was O.C. But I'm keen to get to Plymouth. Never been there before. And I'm blasted sick of the North Sea, I can tell you. Funny thing, though, about leaving my old squadron. Thought I was set there for good. Then suddenly yesterday the O.C. told me I had been assigned to Seventy-Four at Plymouth. Seemed to hint it was special duty, or something. Wouldn't say a thing, though. Just gave me my traveling papers, and such, and sent me off.\"  A suddenly liking for Steffins shot through Dave Dawson. Perhaps the lad was on the same kind of a mission as he and Freddy. He started to open his mouth to speak, but at that instant he happened to catch Freddy's eye. The English youth gave a hair width shake of his head, and said the rest in a look. Dave closed his mouth and started again.  \"It wasn't like that with us,\" he lied. \"Freddy and I asked for a transfer. Change of scenery, and all that kind of stuff. I guess there's more action off the south coast anyway. For the last two weeks we didn't do anything but use up gas and oil. I hope....\"  At that moment all three of them heard the ungodly wail of a plane coming down in an all out power dive. It was not the wail but the sound of the plane's engine that brought them to their feet and diving for the compartment windows. It was not the steady beat of a British or an American engine. It was the throbbing pulsating roar of a German made engine. In fact, the unsynchronized throb of two engines. Even as they reached the window and stared up into the dawn sky they saw that the plane was a long range Nazi Focke-Wulf 187 destroyer plane. The craft was low down and racing in toward the moving train. An instant later the savage yammer of machine gun fire sounded above the beat of the engines.  \"Strafing us!\" Dave shouted unconsciously. \"Why, that tramp! Do I wish I was in a Spitfire or a Hurricane! I'd soon....\"  Dave stopped short, half turned and saw Steffins striving frantically to crawl under one of the seats. The man's face was paper white and he was biting into his lower lip hard. Another yammering burst from the strafing plane and jerked Dave's eyes back to the window. He started to duck himself but checked it as he saw that the pilot of the plane seemed to be concentrating on the rear car of the train. He looked at Freddy and saw the veiled contempt in the English youth's eyes. Freddy half jerked a thumb at Steffins still trying to crawl under the seat, and shrugged.  Dave laughed, and called out to Steffins.  \"Give it up, Steffins! Those things are bolted to the floor. Besides, the lug isn't shooting our way.\"  \"And also he has gone on his merry way!\" Freddy said, turning away from the window. \"The blighter just thought he'd have a bit of murdering sport on the way home. If I was in my old Hurricane he'd jolly well get a bellyful of his kind of sport.\"  Very red of face and twice as sheepish looking, Steffins stopped trying to crawl through bolted wood, and got up onto his feet. He gave Freddy a hard stare, then smiled slowly.  \"Sorry I made such a fool of myself,\" he said with an effort. \"Truth is, though, I got peppered a bit by one of those lads back in the September show. Turns my blood cold every time I hear one of the beggars come down. Well, I guess I'd better buzz back to my compartment and get my stuff together. Must be getting near there, now. Nice to meet you two. Hope we see a lot of each other.\"  \"Sure, I guess we will, Steffins,\" Dave said pleasantly.  \"Right you are,\" Freddy murmured as the pilot slid through the door and closed it shut.  \"A nice guy to have around in the clutch,\" Dave grunted when he and Freddy were alone. \"Ask me and I'll tell you the guy is yellow. Hey, why the heavy scowl, pal? What's suddenly on that thing you call a mind?\"  \"Your nice little friend,\" Freddy said with a jerk of his head toward the door. \"It doesn't quite check. The lad is a bit queer, I'd say.\"  The opening was too perfect for Dave to let it slip by unnoticed.  \"What Englishman isn't?\" he cracked.  \"I'll remember that one,\" Freddy growled. Then grave of face, \"No, serious, Dave. I wish the devil the lad hadn't come in here. I'd feel better right now. I think I've seen him someplace before, but blessed if I can remember where. And the beggar lied to us, unless I'm completely wrong on my R.A.F. squadrons.\"  Dave started another smart remark but cut it off at the look on Freddy's face. He hitched forward a bit on the edge of the seat.  \"How come?\" he asked. \"What are you driving at? I didn't notice anything unusual, but I really wasn't listening very hard. What do you mean?\"  \"A friend of mine _used_ to be in One-Twenty Lockheed Hudsons,\" Freddy said with meaningful emphasis. \"I ran into him a couple of weeks ago, when you and I were at Hull for that spell. He told me then that One-Twenty was _washed out three months ago_. Rather it was hooked up with One-Thirty-Six and they were doing coastal patrol around the Dover area.\"  \"No kidding?\" Dave exclaimed. Then with a puzzled frown, \"But what was the point in the guy lying to us? He.... Say, I had a hunch at first when he came in. Maybe he's on some hush-hush thing like we are.\"  \"I doubt it, and a lot!\" Freddy said tight lipped. \"I'm sure the chap was trying to pump us for all he was worth. Remember that time I shook my head at you? Well, he was fairly falling over on his face waiting for you to speak. And the way he tried to crawl under the seat! No, the lad has something very queer about him. Blast it! I wish I could remember where I've seen him before. I.... Wait! Let me think. I almost had it that time!\"  Freddy scowled hard and pressed both palms against his forehead as though that would help memory to come back. As Dave watched him the tingling sensation came to the back of his neck once again. He sat as a man turned to stone, hardly daring to breathe.  \"Well?\" he finally got out after several tormenting minutes dragged by.  Freddy shook his head, started to gesture for silence with one hand, and then gasped and sat up straight.  \"Got it, of course!\" he cried. \"Unless I'm completely balmy.\"  \"Could be,\" Dave grunted. \"But spill it anyway.\"  \"Earlier tonight just as we were leaving Adastral House,\" Freddy said in a strained voice. \"You were ahead of me yelling for that cabby, so you didn't see. In the blasted blackout I flew full tilt into a chap. We both went flat. I used my flash to help us both get up. And I got a look at the other chap's face. Dave, I swear to you that the chap was this Steffins. I can see his face now as clear as day!\"  \"So what?\" Dave grunted as a sense of disappointment rippled through him. \"The guy was in London to catch this train, and you just happened to collide with him in the blackout. Maybe he didn't get a look at your mug, so didn't recognize you just now.\"  \"Let me finish!\" Freddy snapped angrily. \"When I bumped into him outside Air Ministry _he was wearing the uniform of a captain in the Fifth Londonshire Infantry_!\"  \"Sweet jumping tripe!\" Dave breathed softly. \"And he pops up again on this train wearing an R.A.F. uniform? Heck, Freddy, you must have made a mistake. It doesn't add up to make sense!\"  \"Perhaps it doesn't,\" Freddy said with a shrug. \"But I still don't like that chap. And what's more, when we get to Plymouth I'm going to make it my job to find out more about him.\"  Dave made no reply. He turned his head and stared absently out the car window. For reasons he couldn't possibly explain to himself at the time he suddenly had the feeling that Freddy Farmer had spoken words of truth. That the English youth had looked into the future, seen what the war gods were brewing, and spoken an advance warning for them both. Dave shivered slightly and turned from the window.  \"I wonder what it will "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50960"],["title","Dave Dawson on Convoy Patrol (#4)"],["body","like when peace comes to this cockeyed world again,\" he grunted.  \"I wonder how many of us will be around to find out,\" Freddy murmured as though talking to himself.     CHAPTER FOUR  _Atlantic Fury_   With her twin engines thundering out their duet of mighty power, the American built Consolidated \"Catalina\" flying boat patrolled back and forth over the convoy of fifteen merchant ships plowing through the Atlantic swells toward the southwest coast of England. At the controls sat Dave Dawson, and at his side in the co-pilot and navigator's seat was Freddy Farmer. Aft at their respective stations were the three other members of the plane's crew. For seven long hours the flying boat had been escorting the convoy through dangerous waters. And every instant of that time five pairs of R.A.F. eyes had been searching the waters below for signs of a lurking group of Nazi \"steel fish,\" and scanning the heavens for the first glimpse of a Nazi air raider winging out from its base in occupied France.  Nine solid hours of being constantly on the alert, and not so much as a single floating hunk of wood sighted. It was as though the Germans had no idea that valuable cargoes of war material were headed for England. Or else the presence of the Catalina flying boat and the small but heavily armed \"Corvette\" escort freighter leading the convoy made them decide to leave it alone. At any rate the merchant ships had not received a single scare, and soon they would be through the danger zone and unloading their war stuffs at England's docks.  Taking one hand from the controls, Dave dug knuckles into his tired eyes and sighed heavily.  \"If this is the British idea of a joke,\" he growled, \"all that I can say is that it smells out loud.\"  \"Meaning what?\" Freddy asked and made a few final marks on his navigation charts. \"Mad because all those ships down there are going to get through safely?\"  \"Nuts, of course not!\" Dave snapped and gave him a scornful side glance. \"And you know darn well what I mean.\"  \"That's true, I do,\" Freddy said and scowled out over the nose of the flying boat's hull. \"Certainly is funny. Do you think by chance that something's gone haywire?\"  \"All I know is that _I'm_ getting close to going haywire!\" Dave replied savagely. \"For two days now, we've been attached to Seventy-Four Squadron of the Coastal Command, and what have we done? Nothing but toot these big babies out over the Atlantic, pick up a merchant convoy, and toot back with them. Not a sign of a U-boat, not a sign of a Nazi plane, and.... Heck! Not a sign of anything. And we were two chaps who were to tackle a do-or-die mission and receive secret orders from our new O.C. You know, Freddy, I'm beginning to think, it's all a lot of hog wash. But why Air Marshal Manners should hand out all that fancy stuff sure beats me.\"  \"I'm just as much in the dark myself,\" Freddy grunted. \"But somehow I don't think that it was supposed to be this way. I think that something went wrong some place, and Manners had to hold up our special orders. Or perhaps he wanted us to get well acquainted with things. I mean, make it definitely look as though we were just a couple of replacements.\"  \"Maybe so,\" Dave sighed and stared at the flock of British destroyers steaming out to take over and lead the convoy into port. \"Maybe so, but I still don't like it. So help me, I doubt I'd be able to recognize a Nazi plane now if one should fall into my lap. Well, there're the destroyers, so this trick is over. Send the code signal to Plymouth Base that we've made contact and are coming in. And tell Sergeant Black aft that I'll have another slub of that coffee before we go in. And tell him I mean coffee, _not_ tea!\"  \"A regular barbarian, drinking that horrible stuff!\" Freddy groaned and adjusted his radio mike. \"I swear, we'll never be able to make you a real Englishman!\"  \"It's still coffee!\" Dave said with a grin. \"And hurry it along, my little man.\"  A few minutes later the Catalina flyingboat had left the convoy far behind and safely in the charge of the destroyers. A cup of warm coffee was in Dave's stomach, and he was almost becoming slightly satisfied with the world again. Now, if only about forty-'leven Nazi planes would show up and give them a little action everything would be all to the merry. No hope of that, though, he reflected gloomily. They were too near to Base, and any Jerry lad who showed his nose around Plymouth Base just naturally didn't get back to Germany. The Jerries knew that and so they stayed well clear of that little bit of England.  \"And what about the great mystery, Dave?\" Freddy suddenly spoke up to break his train of thought. \"Do you think we should go to Squadron Leader Hays and tell him our story?\"  \"Meaning your boy friend, Flying Officer Steffins?\" Dave echoed with a frown.  \"None other,\" the English youth replied. \"I told you there was something queer about that chap. I really think we should speak to Squadron Leader Hays about him.\"  Dave made no comment for a few moments. During these two days at Plymouth Base he had thought a lot of thoughts about the queer acting R.A.F. pilot they had met on the train coming down. And the most important thought was the fact that neither he nor Freddy had so much as set eyes on the man since the moment he had picked himself up off the compartment floor after the Nazi plane strafe and gone forward to his own seat. The man had simply vanished into thin air. He most certainly had not reported at Plymouth Base. Freddy had made sure of that by asking all around. As a matter of fact, nobody at Plymouth Base had even heard of the man. And the bulletin board in the mess had said in so much black type that Dawson and Farmer were the only two replacements posted to Seventy-Four.  \"Sorry to wake you up, Dave,\" Freddy spoke again. \"But what do you think about the situation?\"  \"Pipe down, I was thinking,\" Dave growled. \"But I can't even get to first base. Maybe we should speak to the Squadron Leader, yet that might make us look like a couple of saps. If there's one thing that gets a fellow's goat in this war it's the dizzy unfounded spy scares that pop up every time you turn a corner. And after all, to us he was just a yellow belly who shot off his face and asked a lot of questions. Maybe he was just some bird posing as an R.A.F. officer just for the heck of it. That sort of thing's happened before. You know, some bird wants to make an impression on his girl and he goes calling all dolled up as an officer, when he really should be wearing his private's uniform. No, Freddy, I don't think Squadron Leader Hays would love us extra much if we went to him with such a crazy story.\"  \"I'm afraid you're right,\" Freddy grunted. \"It is just a little bit crazy. But I still swear he's the same chap I bumped into in front of Adastral House.\"  \"Well, maybe that time he was calling on a girl who likes the Army best,\" Dave chuckled. \"Anyway, let's skip it for the time being. There's Base, and here we go down to a stack of warm food, and a little shut eye.\"  Dave's statement was half truth and half falsehood. They did put away a stack of food, but there was to be no shut-eye for either of them. They had hardly finished their meal when an orderly appeared with word that they were to report at once to Squadron Leader Hays' office. They exchanged looks, grinned happily, and instantly lost all desire for sleep.  \"Hot dog!\" Dave breathed and pushed back from the table. \"Maybe this is it!\"  \"I'm saying nothing until I'm dead sure,\" Freddy grunted and got up, too. \"The way things are going perhaps we're to be favored with the special honor of washing dishes.\"  \"Boy, can you make a guy feel good!\" Dave growled and gave his best pal a playful poke in the ribs.  When they reached the Squadron Leader's their hopes dropped a little for the simple reason that they were not the only two summoned. There were ten other pilots there as well. Squadron Leader Hays waited until Dave and Freddy had settled themselves in chairs and then started to speak.  \"Special job for you fellows,\" he said. \"Coastal Command is testing out a new type of plane to be used on short range work. It's the new Fairey \"Fulmar\" fighter. It's powered with a Bristol Pegasus engine that's been jacked up a bit to give a couple of hundred more horsepower than the ordinary Pegasus. It's a land job, of course, but it's been fitted with extra tanks, and sections of the wings are sealed so that you'll float for quite a bit of time in case you fall down into the drink. Whether these Fulmars will give us the service Coastal Command demands remains to be seen. Anyway, six of them arrived last night, and I've selected you chaps to give them a good testing. If you can find any off-shore Nazi planes then so much the better. However, don't go too far out, and don't get too close to the French coast. You can be sure that the Jerries are just aching to shoot down a Fulmar and get a good look at it. Well, that's all. They're out on the line now, and the mechanics are waiting. You can take off any time you want.\"  The Squadron Leader made a little gesture with his hand that dismissed the group. Disappointment tugging at their hearts, Dave and Freddy started toward the Squadron Office door, but pulled up short as the Commanding Officer spoke again.  \"Oh, Dawson and Farmer!\" he called out. \"Wait a moment, will you?\"  Both youths wheeled around with hope soaring up anew. The Squadron Leader waited until all the others had left, then grimaced and sighed unhappily.  \"Darnedest war I ever fought in!\" he growled and motioned to the boys to step closer. \"There's enough blasted hush-hush stuff to smother the whole Empire. Of course what I told the others was plain rot. We've got Fulmars here, and they are to stay for keeps. This testing idea is all bosh. But orders are orders. So there's nothing I can do about it.\"  The Squadron Leader made another face and took a sealed envelop from out of his inside tunic pocket."]]]
