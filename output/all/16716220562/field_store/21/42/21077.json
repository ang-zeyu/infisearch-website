Nothung's point home has speeded!  FAFNER [_In a weaker voice._  Who art thou, boy bold-hearted,     That hast pierced my breast? Who stirred up thy childish soul     To the murderous deed? Thy brain schemed not the harm     Wrought by thy hand.  SIEGFRIED  Not much have I learned, Not even who I am; Thou thyself with thy taunting Stirred me to fight and to slay.  FAFNER  O boy bright-eyed, Who knowest not yet who thou art,     Whom thou hast murdered     Hear from me. Two mighty giants there were,     Fasolt and Fafner; The brothers now are both fallen.     For the cursèd gold     We got from the Gods I did Fasolt to death.     He who now guards     The hoard as dragon, Fafner, the last remaining, Falls, by a rosy boy slain.     Boy in thy bloom,     Watch and be wary: He who stirred thee blind to this deed Takes thought how to compass thy death.          [_Dying._      Mark the ending!     Think on me!  SIEGFRIED      Who was my father?     Tell, if thou canst.     Dying, thou showest,     Wild one, much wisdom. Siegfried my name is; haply That may help thee to guess.  FAFNER      Siegfried!...          [_He raises himself and dies._  SIEGFRIED  The dead can tell no tidings.     My living sword, lead!     Lead onward, my sword!          [_Fafner has rolled to the side in dying. Siegfried         now draws the sword from his breast. In doing so         his hand gets sprinkled with the blood; he draws it         back quickly._      The hot blood burns like fire!          [_Involuntarily he raises his fingers to his mouth         to suck the blood from them. As he looks musingly         before him his attention becomes more and more         attracted by the singing of the birds._      I almost seem To hear the birds speaking to me.     Is there a spell,     Perhaps, in the blood? The curious bird up there-- Hark! he sings to me.  VOICE OF THE WOOD-BIRD          [_From the branches of the lime-tree above         Siegfried._      Hei! Siegfried now owns     All the Nibelung hoard!     Oh! could he the hoard     In the cave but find! Tarnhelm, if he could but win it, Would help him to deeds of renown; And could he discover the ring, It would make him the lord of the world!   [Illustration: \"The hot blood burns like fire!\"--See p 58]   SIEGFRIED          [_Has listened holding his breath and beaming with         delight._      Thanks, bonnie bird,     For the counsel good:     I follow the call!          [_He turns towards the back and descends to the         cave, where he at once disappears._  _Mime steals up, looking about him timidly to assure himself of Fafner's death. At the same time Alberich comes out of the cleft on the opposite side. He observes Mime, rushes on him and bars his way, as the latter turns towards the cave._   ALBERICH      On what errand     Furtive and sly,     Knave, dost thou slink?  MIME      Accursèd brother,     That thou shouldst come!     What brings thee here?  ALBERICH      Rogue, has my gold     Provoked thy greed?     Dost covet my goods?  MIME      Get thee gone quickly!     This corner is mine;     What huntest thou here?  ALBERICH      Have I disturbed thee,     Thief, at thy work,     Secret and sly?  MIME      What I have slaved     And toiled to win     Shall not escape me.  ALBERICH      Who was it robbed The Rhine of gold for the ring?     And whose cunning wrought The spell of magical might?  MIME      Who made the Tarnhelm, Changing its wearer's form?     Though thou didst want it, Was it designed by thee?  ALBERICH      And what of thyself Couldst aright have fashioned, thou bungler?     The magic ring Forced thee to master thy craft.  MIME      And where is the ring? 'Twas reft from thy clutch by the giants.     What thou hast lost I will gain and keep by my guile.  ALBERICH      What the boy has won Would the niggard deny him?     'Tis not thine; the hero Who won it is now its lord.  MIME      I brought him up; For my pains now he shall pay;     For its reward My trouble has waited too long.  ALBERICH      Just for rearing him,     The old niggardly,     Beggarly knave,     Bold as brass, A king now would become?     The ring would befit     Better a dog     Than bumpkin like thee.     Never to thee The magical ring shall fall!  MIME [_Scratches his head._      Well, keep it, then,     And guard with care     The gleaming gold;     Be thou lord, But treat me as a brother;     Give me against it     Tarnhelm for toy,     Fairly exchanged;     Divided thus, There will be booty for both.          [_He rubs his hands confidingly._  ALBERICH [_With a mocking laugh._      Share it with thee?     And the Tarnhelm too!     How sly thou art!     I could never Sleep for a moment safely.  MIME [_Beside himself._      What! not even     Strike a bargain!     I must go bare,     Beggared of gain! Thou wouldst leave me with nothing!          [_Shrieking._  ALBERICH      Nothing, not so     Much as a nail,     Shall fall to thy portion.  MIME [_In a fury._      Neither ring nor Tarnhelm     Shall thy hand touch, then;     'Tis I will not share!     I will call on Siegfried,     Summon the aid     Of his keen-edged sword;     The lad will make Short work, dear brother, of thee!  ALBERICH          [_Siegfried having appeared in the background._      Turn and look there! From the cavern hither he comes.  MIME      He will have chosen     Trivial toys.  ALBERICH      He bears the Tarnhelm!  MIME      Also the ring!  ALBERICH  Curst luck! The ring!  MIME [_Laughing maliciously._  Get him to give thee the ring now! 'Tis I, not thou, who shall win it.  ALBERICH      And yet to its lord Must it at last be surrendered!          [_He disappears in the cleft._          [_During the foregoing Siegfried, with Tarnhelm and         ring, has come slowly and meditatively from the         cave; he regards his booty thoughtfully, and stops         on the knoll in the middle of the stage._  SIEGFRIED      I do not know     Of what use     Ye are; I chose you From out the heaped-up hoard Because of friendly advice.     Meanwhile, of this day     Be ye worn as witness,     Recalling to mind How with fallen Fafner I fought, And yet could not learn how to fear.          [_He hangs the Tarnhelm on his girdle and puts         the ring on his finger. Silence. His notice is         involuntarily drawn to the bird again, and he         listens to him with breathless attention._   [Illustration: The dwarfs quarrelling over the body of Fafner. See p. 59]   THE WOOD-BIRD'S VOICE   Hei! Siegfried now owns     Both the helm and the ring!     Oh! let him not listen     To Mime, the false! He were wise to be wary of Mime's treacherous tongue.     He will understand     Mime's secret intent, Because he has tasted the blood.          [_Siegfried's mien and gestures show that he         has understood the bird's song. He sees Mime         approaching, and remains without moving, leaning         on his sword, observant and self-contained, in his         place on the knoll till the close of the following         scene._  MIME          [_Steals forward, and observes Siegfried from the         foreground._      He weighs in his mind     The booty's worth;     Can there by chance     Have come this way     A Wanderer wise     Who talked to the child, And taught him crafty runes?     Doubly sly     Be then the dwarf;     My snares must be cunning,     Cleverly set,     That with cajoling     And wily falsehoods The insolent boy I may fool.          [_He goes nearer to Siegfried and welcomes him with         flattering gestures._      Ha! Welcome, Siegfried!     Say, bold fighter, Hast thou been taught how to fear?  SIEGFRIED  A teacher still is to find.  MIME      But the dragon grim     Has fallen before thee? A fell and fierce monster was he.  SIEGFRIED  Though grim and spiteful the brute, I grieve over his death, While there live still, unpunished, Blacker scoundrels than he was! The one who bade me slay I hate far more than the slain.  MIME [_Very friendly._      Have patience! Thou wilt not     Look on me long.  [_Sweetly._      In endless sleep Soon thine eyelids will be sealed.    Thy uses are over,          [_As if praising him._      Done is the deed;     The only task left For me is to win the booty. Methinks that task will not tax me; Thou wert always easy to fool.  SIEGFRIED  To me thou art plotting harm, then?  MIME [_Astonished._      What makes thee think that?          [_Continuing tenderly._  Siegfried, listen, my own one! I have always loathed Thee and all that are like thee.     It was not from love     That I reared thee with care: The gold hid in Fafner's cave I worked for as my reward.          [_As if he were promising him something nice._      If thou wilt not yield     It up to me,          [_As if he were ready to lay down his life for him._      Siegfried, my son,     Thou plainly must see          [_As if in friendly jest._  I have no choice but to slay thee!  SIEGFRIED      That I am hated     Pleases me; But must I lose my life for thy pleasure?  MIME [_Angrily._      I never said that;     Thou hast made a mistake.     See, thou art weary     From stress of strife, Burning with fever and thirst;     Mime, the kind one,     To cool thy thirst Brought a quickening draught.     While thy blade thou didst melt     I brewed thee the drink;     Touch it, and straight Thy sword shall be mine, And mine the hoard and Tarnhelm too.          [_Tittering._  SIEGFRIED      So thou of my sword     And all it has won me-- Ring and booty--wouldst rob me?  MIME [_Violently._  Why wilt mistake so my words! Do I drivel or dote?     I use the utmost     Pains with my speech,     That what in my heart     I mean may be hidden;     And the stupid boy Misunderstands what I say!     Open thy ears, boy,     And attend to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],["title","Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#7)"],["body","me! Hear, now, what Mime means. Take this: the drink will refresh thee As my drinks oft have done.     Many a time     When fretful and bad,     Though loth enough, The draughts I brought thou hast swallowed.  SIEGFRIED      Of a cooling drink     I were glad; Say, how has this one been brewed?  MIME          [_Jesting merrily, as if describing to him a         pleasant state of intoxication which the liquor is         to bring about._      Hei! Just drink it!     Trust to my skill.     In mist and darkness Soon shall thy senses be sunk;     None to watch or ward them, Stark-stretched shall thy limbs be.     Thou lying thus,     'Twere not hard To take the booty and hide it;     But wert thou to awake,     Nevermore would     Mime be safe, Even owning the ring.     So with the sword     He has made so sharp          [_With a gesture of extravagant joy._      First I will hack     The child's head off! Then I shall have both rest and the ring!          [_Tittering._  SIEGFRIED  Thou wouldst, then, slay me when sleeping?  MIME [_Furiously._  Do what, child? Did I say that?          [_He takes pains to assume the utmost tenderness.         Carefully and distinctly._      I only mean     To chop off thy head!          [_With the appearance of heartfelt solicitude for         Siegfried's health._      For even if I     Had loathed thee less,     And had not thy scoffs     And my drudgery shameful So loudly urged to vengeance,          [_Gently._      I should never dare to pause     Till from my path I thrust thee:          [_Jestingly again._  How else could I come by the booty, Which Alberich covets as well?          [_He pours the liquid into the drinking-horn, and         offers it to Siegfried with pressing gestures._      Now, my Wälsung,     Wolf-begot, Drink the draught and be choked, And never drink again!          [_Tittering._  SIEGFRIED [_Threatens him with his sword._      Taste thou my sword,     Loathsome babbler!          [_As if seized by violent loathing, he gives Mime a         sharp stroke with his sword. Instantly Mime falls         dead to the ground. Alberich's voice in mocking         laughter from the cleft._  SIEGFRIED          [_Looking at Mime on the ground, quietly hangs his         sword again on his belt._      Envy's wage     Pays Nothung; 'Twas for this that I forged him.          [_He picks up Mime's body, carries it to the knoll,         and throws it into the cave._      In the cavern, there,     Lie on the hoard;     With steadfast guile     The gold thou hast gained: Now let it belong to its master! And a watchman good I give thee, that thieves Never may enter and steal.          [_With a great effort he pushes the body of the         dragon in front of the entrance to the cave, which         it completely stops up._      There lie thou too,     Dragon grim;     Along with thy foe     Greedy of gain Thou shalt guard the glittering gold: So both at last shall rest in peace.          [_He looks down thoughtfully into the cave for a         time, and then turns slowly to the front of the         stage as if tired. He passes his hand over his         brow._      Hot I feel     From the heavy toil;     Fast and furious     Flows my blood, My hand burns on my head. High stands the sun in heaven;     From azure heights     Falls his gaze Through a cloudless sky on my crown. Pleasant shadows will cool me under the linden.          [_He stretches himself out under the lime-tree, and         again looks up through the boughs._  If only, pretty warbler,     So long and so     Rudely disturbed, I could once more hear thee singing!     On a branch I see thee     Merrily swaying;     Chirping and chattering,     Brothers and sisters Are happily hovering round.  But I--I am alone, Without brother or sister;     My mother died,     My father fell, Unseen by their son!     The one soul I knew     Was a loathsome old dwarf;          [_Warmly._      Love he festered not     By kindness;     Many a cunning     Snare did he set me; At last I was forced to slay him.          [_He looks sorrowfully up at the branches._      Bird sweet and friendly,     I ask thee a boon:     Wilt thou find for me     A comrade true?-- Wilt thou choose for me the right one?     So oft I have called,     And yet no one has come!     Thou, my friend,     Wilt manage it better, So wise thy counsel has been.          [_Softly._  Now sing! I hearken to thy song.  THE WOOD-BIRD'S VOICE      Hei! Siegfried has slain     The deceitful dwarf!     I know for him now     A glorious bride. She sleeps where rugged rocks soar; Ringed is her chamber by fire.     Who battles the flames,     Wakens the bride, Brünnhilde wins as reward.  SIEGFRIED          [_Starts up impetuously from his seat._      O lovely song,     Flower-sweet breath!     Thy yearning music     Burns in my breast!     Like leaping flame     It kindles my heart.     What races so swift     Through soul and senses? Sweetest of friends, O say!          [_He listens._  THE WOOD-BIRD'S VOICE      Grieving yet glad,     Love I am singing;     Blissful, from woe     Weaving my song: They only who yearn understand.  SIEGFRIED      Forth, forth then,     Swift and rejoicing! Forth from the wood to the fell!     Just one thing more     I would learn, sweet singer: Say, shall I break through the fire? Can I awaken the bride?          [_He listens again._  THE WOOD-BIRD'S VOICE      No coward wins     Brünnhild' for bride,     Or wakes the maid: Only a heart without fear.  SIEGFRIED [_Shouting with joy._      The foolish boy     Who has never learned fear, Dear bird, that dullard am I!     To-day I took endless     Trouble in vain, To find out what fear was from Fafner.     With longing I burn     Now from Brünnhild' to learn it. What path soonest leads to the fell?          [_The bird flutters up, circles over Siegfried, and         flies hesitatingly before him._  SIEGFRIED  The bird to my goal will guide me.     Fly where thou wilt,     I follow thy flight!          [_He runs after the bird, who for a time flies         uncertainly hither and thither to tease him; at         last he follows him, when, taking a definite         direction towards the back, the bird flies away._  [Illustration]   [Illustration]     THE THIRD ACT       _A wild spot at the foot of a rocky mountain which     rises precipitously at the back on the left. Night,     storm, lightning and violent thunder. The latter     ceases shortly, but the lightning continues to     flash from the clouds for some time. The Wanderer     enters and walks resolutely towards a cavernous     opening in a rock in the foreground, and takes up     his position there, leaning on his spear, while he     calls the following towards the entrance to the     cave._   WANDERER      Waken, Wala!     Wala! Awake!     From thy long sleep, Slumberer, wake at my call!     I summon thee forth:     Arise! Arise!     From cloud-covered caves In earth's dim abysses, arise!     Erda! Erda,     Old as the world!     From depths dark and hidden     Rise to the day!     With song I call thee,     I sing to wake thee,     From deep dreams of wisdom     Bid thee arise.     All-knowing one!     Fount of knowledge!     Erda! Erda,     Old as the world! Waken! Awaken, thou Vala! Awaken!          [_A dim bluish light begins to dawn in the cavern.         In this light Erda, during the following, rises         very gradually from below. She appears to be         covered with hoar-frost, which glitters on her hair         and garments._  ERBA  Loud is the call; Strong the spell that summons;     I have been roused     From dark and wise dreams: Who wakes me from my sleep?  WANDERER      'Tis I who awake thee     With song of magic,     That what in slumber Was folded fast may rise.     The wide earth ranging,     Far I have roamed,     Seeking for knowledge, Wisdom at fountains primeval.     No one that lives     Is wiser than thou;     Thou knowest all     In the hidden depths,     What moves on hill, Dale, in water and air.     Where life is found,     There thou art breathing;     And where brains ponder,     There is thy thought.     Men say that all     Knowledge is thine. That I might ask of thee counsel, I have called thee from sleep.  ERBA      My sleep is dreaming,     My dreaming brooding, My brooding wisdom's calm working.     But while I sleep     The Norns are wakeful:     They twine the rope, And deftly weave what I know. The Norns thou shouldst have questioned.  WANDERER      In thrall to the world     Sit the Norns weaving;     They cannot alter     What ordained is.     But I would fain     Be taught of thy wisdom How a wheel on the roll can be stayed.  ERBA      Dark and troubled My mind grows through men's deeds.     A God once subdued The Wala's self to his will.     A wish-maiden     I bore to Wotan;     From fields of battle She brought him slain heroes;     Bold is she     And wise to boot:     Why waken me?     Why seek not counsel From Erda's and Wotan's child?  WANDERER      The Valkyrie, Brünnhild'?     Meanest thou her? She flouted the storm-controller, When, sorely urged, himself he controlled.     What the swayer and lord     Of battles longed for,     What he refrained from     Against his desire,     Brünnhilde, bold,     Rash, over-confident, When the fight was at fiercest, Strove for herself to perform.     War-father     Punished the maid: He pressed slumber into her eyes, On the flame-girt rock she sleeps.     The hallowed maid     Will waken alone, That she may love and wed with a man. Small hope of answer from her.  ERBA      Dazed have I felt     Since I woke;     Wild, confused     Seems the world!     The Valkyrie,     The Wala's child, Bound lay, fettered by sleep, While her all-knowing mother slept!     Does revolt's teacher     Chide revolt?     Does the deed he urged to     Anger him, done?     He who guards the right,     To whom vows are sacred,     Hinders the right?--     Reigns through falsehood?"]]]
