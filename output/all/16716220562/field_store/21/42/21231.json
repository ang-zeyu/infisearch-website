Nell was his daughter!\"    III  As thought and feeling multiplied, Cameron was overwhelmed.  Beyond belief, indeed, was it that out of the millions of men in the world two who had never seen each other could have been driven into the desert by memory of the same woman.  It brought the past so close.  It showed Cameron how inevitably all his spiritual life was governed by what had happened long ago.  That which made life significant to him was a wandering in silent places where no eye could see him with his secret. Some fateful chance had thrown him with the father of the girl he had wrecked. It was incomprehensible; it was terrible.  It was the one thing of all possible happenings in the world of chance that both father and lover would have found unendurable.  Cameron's pain reached to despair when he felt this relation between Warren and himself.  Something within him cried out to him to reveal his identity.  Warren would kill him; but it was not fear of death that put Cameron on the rack.  He had faced death too often to be afraid. It was the thought of adding torture to this long-suffering man.  All at once Cameron swore that he would not augment Warren's trouble, or let him stain his hands with blood.  He would tell the truth of Nell's sad story and his own, and make what amends he could.  Then Cameron's thought shifted from father to daughter.  She was somewhere beyond the dim horizon line.  In those past lonely hours by the campfire his fancy had tortured him with pictures of Nell. But his remorseful and cruel fancy had lied to him.  Nell had struggled upward out of menacing depths.  She had reconstructed a broken life.  And now she was fighting for the name and happiness of her child.  Little Nell! Cameron experienced a shuddering ripple in all his being--the physical rack of an emotion born of a new and strange consciousness.  As Cameron gazed out over the blood-red, darkening desert suddenly the strife in his soul ceased.  The moment was one of incalculable change, in which his eyes seemed to pierce the vastness of cloud and range, and mystery of gloom and shadow--to see with strong vision the illimitable space before him.  He felt the grandeur of the desert, its simplicity, its truth.  He had learned at last the lesson it taught.  No longer strange was his meeting and wandering with Warren. Each had marched in the steps of destiny; and as the lines of their fates had been inextricably tangled in the years that were gone, so now their steps had crossed and turned them toward one common goal.  For years they had been two men marching alone, answering to an inward driving search, and the desert had brought them together. For years they had wandered alone in silence and solitude, where the sun burned white all day and the stars burned white all night, blindly following the whisper of a spirit.  But now Cameron knew that he was no longer blind, and in this flash of revelation he felt that it had been given him to help Warren with his burden.  He returned to camp trying to evolve a plan.  As always at that long hour when the afterglow of sunset lingered in the west, Warren plodded to and fro in the gloom.  All night Cameron lay awake thinking.  In the morning, when Warren brought the burros to camp and began preparations for the usual packing, Cameron broke silence.  \"Pardner, your story last night made me think.  I want to tell you something about myself.  It's hard enough to be driven by sorrow for one you've loved, as you've been driven; but to suffer sleepless and eternal remorse for the ruin of one you've loved as I have suffered--that is hell....  Listen.  In my younger days--it seems long now, yet it's not so many years--I was wild.  I wronged the sweetest and loveliest girl I ever knew.  I went away not dreaming that any disgrace might come to her.  Along about that time I fell into terrible moods--I changed--I learned I really loved her.  Then came a letter I should have gotten months before.  It told of her trouble--importuned me to hurry to save her.  Half frantic with shame and fear, I got a marriage certificate and rushed back to her town. She was gone--had been gone for weeks, and her disgrace was known. Friends warned me to keep out of reach of her father.  I trailed her--found her.  I married her.  But too late!... She would not live with me. She left me--I followed her west, but never found her.\"  Warren leaned forward a little and looked into Cameron's eyes, as if searching there for the repentance that might make him less deserving of a man's scorn.  Cameron met the gaze unflinchingly, and again began to speak:  \"You know, of course, how men out here somehow lose old names, old identities.  It won't surprise you much to learn my name really isn't Cameron, as I once told you.\"  Warren stiffened upright.  It seemed that there might have been a blank, a suspension, between his grave interest and some strange mood to come.  Cameron felt his heart bulge and contract in his breast; all his body grew cold; and it took tremendous effort for him to make his lips form words.  \"Warren, I'm the man you're hunting.  I'm Burton.  I was Nell's lover!\"  The old man rose and towered over Cameron, and then plunged down upon him, and clutched at his throat with terrible stifling hands. The harsh contact, the pain awakened Cameron to his peril before it was too late. Desperate fighting saved him from being hurled to the ground and stamped and crushed.  Warren seemed a maddened giant.  There was a reeling, swaying, wrestling struggle before the elder man began to weaken.  The Cameron, buffeted, bloody, half-stunned, panted for speech.  \"Warren--hold on!  Give me--a minute.  I married Nell.  Didn't you know that?... I saved the child!\"  Cameron felt the shock that vibrated through Warren.  He repeated the words again and again.  As if compelled by some resistless power, Warren released Cameron, and, staggering back, stood with uplifted, shaking hands.  In his face was a horrible darkness.  \"Warren!  Wait--listen!\" panted Cameron.  \"I've got that marriage certificate--I've had it by me all these years.  I kept it--to prove to myself I did right.\"  The old man uttered a broken cry.  Cameron stole off among the rocks.  How long he absented himself or what he did he had no idea.  When he returned Warren was sitting before the campfire, and once more he appeared composed.  He spoke, and his voice had a deeper note; but otherwise he seemed as usual.  They packed the burros and faced the north together.  Cameron experienced a singular exaltation.  He had lightened his comrade's burden.  Wonderfully it came to him that he had also lightened his own.  From that hour it was not torment to think of Nell. Walking with his comrade through the silent places, lying beside him under the serene luminous light of the stars, Cameron began to feel the haunting presence of invisible things that were real to him--phantoms whispering peace.  In the moan of the cool wind, in the silken seep of sifting sand, in the distant rumble of a slipping ledge, in the faint rush of a shooting star he heard these phantoms of peace coming with whispers of the long pain of men at the last made endurable.  Even in the white noonday, under the burning sun, these phantoms came to be real to him. In the dead silence of the midnight hours he heard them breathing nearer on the desert wind--nature's voices of motherhood, whispers of God, peace in the solitude.    IV  There came a morning when the sun shone angry and red through a dull, smoky haze.  \"We're in for sandstorms,\" said Cameron.  They had scarcely covered a mile when a desert-wide, moaning, yellow wall of flying sand swooped down upon them.  Seeking shelter in the lee of a rock, they waited, hoping the storm was only a squall, such as frequently whipped across the open places.  The moan increased to a roar, and the dull red slowly dimmed, to disappear in the yellow pall, and the air grew thick and dark.  Warren slipped the packs from the burros.  Cameron feared the sandstorms had arrived some weeks ahead of their usual season.  The men covered their heads and patiently waited.  The long hours dragged, and the storm increased in fury.  Cameron and Warren wet scarfs with water from their canteens, and bound them round their faces, and then covered their heads.  The steady, hollow bellow of flying sand went on.  It flew so thickly that enough sifted down under the shelving rock to weight the blankets and almost bury the men.  They were frequently compelled to shake off the sand to keep from being borne to the ground.  And it was necessary to keep digging out the packs.  The floor of their shelter gradually rose higher and higher. They tried to eat, and seemed to be grinding only sand between their teeth.  They lost the count of time. They dared not sleep, for that would have meant being buried alive. The could only crouch close to the leaning rock, shake off the sand, blindly dig out their packs, and every moment gasp and cough and choke to fight suffocation.  The storm finally blew itself out.  It left the prospectors heavy and stupid for want of sleep.  Their burros had wandered away, or had been buried in the sand.  Far as eye could reach the desert had marvelously changed; it was now a rippling sea of sand dunes. Away to the north rose the peak that was their only guiding mark. They headed toward it, carrying a shovel and part of their packs.  At noon the peak vanished in the shimmering glare of the desert. The prospectors pushed on, guided by the sun.  In every wash they tried for water.  With the forked peach branch in his hands Warren always succeeded in locating water.  They dug, but it lay too deep.  At length, spent and sore, they fell and slept through that night and part of the next day.  Then they succeeded in getting water, and quenched their thirst, and filled the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],["title","Desert Gold (#3)"],["body","ns, and cooked a meal.  The burning day found them in an interminably wide plain, where there was no shelter from the fierce sun. The men were exceedingly careful with their water, though there was absolute necessity of drinking a little every hour.  Late in the afternoon they came to a canyon that they believed was the lower end of the one in which they had last found water.  For hours they traveled toward its head, and, long after night had set, found what they sought. Yielding to exhaustion, they slept, and next day were loath to leave the waterhole.  Cool night spurred them on with canteens full and renewed strength.  Morning told Cameron that they had turned back miles into the desert, and it was desert new to him.  The red sun, the increasing heat, and especially the variety and large size of the cactus plants warned Cameron that he had descended to a lower level.  Mountain peaks loomed on all sides, some near, others distant; and one, a blue spur, splitting the glaring sky far to the north, Cameron thought he recognized as a landmark.  The ascent toward it was heartbreaking, not in steepness, but in its league-and-league-long monotonous rise. Cameron knew there was only one hope--to make the water hold out and never stop to rest.  Warren began to weaken. Often he had to halt.  The burning white day passed, and likewise the night, with its white stars shining so pitilessly cold and bright.  Cameron measured the water in his canteen by its weight.  Evaporation by heat consumed as much as he drank.  During one of the rests, when he had wetted his parched mouth and throat, he found opportunity to pour a little water from his canteen into Warren's.  At first Cameron had curbed his restless activity to accommodate the pace of his elder comrade.  But now he felt that he was losing something of his instinctive and passionate zeal to get out of the desert.  The thought of water came to occupy his mind.  He began to imagine that his last little store of water did not appreciably diminish.  He knew he was not quite right in his mind regarding water; nevertheless, he felt this to be more of fact than fancy, and he began to ponder.  When next they rested he pretended to be in a kind of stupor; but he covertly watched Warren.  The man appeared far gone, yet he had cunning.  He cautiously took up Cameron's canteen and poured water into it from his own.  This troubled Cameron.  The old irritation at not being able to thwart Warren returned to him.  Cameron reflected, and concluded that he had been unwise not to expect this very thing.  Then, as his comrade dropped into weary rest, he lifted both canteens.  If there were any water in Warren's, it was only very little.  Both men had been enduring the terrible desert thirst, concealing it, each giving his water to the other, and the sacrifice had been useless.  Instead of ministering to the parched throats of one or both, the water had evaporated.  When Cameron made sure of this, he took one more drink, the last, and poured the little water left into Warren's canteen.  He threw his own away.  Soon afterward Warren discovered the loss.  \"Where's your canteen?\" he asked.  \"The heat was getting my water, so I drank what was left.\"  \"My son!\" said Warren.  The day opened for them in a red and green hell of rock and cactus. Like a flame the sun scorched and peeled their faces.  Warren went blind from the glare, and Cameron had to lead him.  At last Warren plunged down, exhausted, in the shade of a ledge.  Cameron rested and waited, hopeless, with hot, weary eyes gazing down from the height where he sat.  The ledge was the top step of a ragged gigantic stairway.  Below stretched a sad, austere, and lonely valley. A dim, wide streak, lighter than the bordering gray, wound down the valley floor.  Once a river had flowed there, leaving only a forlorn trace down the winding floor of this forlorn valley.  Movement on the part of Warren attracted Cameron's attention. Evidently the old prospector had recovered his sight and some of his strength, for he had arisen, and now began to walk along the arroyo bed with his forked peach branch held before him.  He had clung to the precious bit of wood.  Cameron considered the prospect for water hopeless, because he saw that the arroyo had once been a canyon, and had been filled with sands by desert winds.  Warren, however, stopped in a deep pit, and, cutting his canteen in half, began to use one side of it as a scoop. He scooped out a wide hollow, so wide that Cameron was certain he had gone crazy.  Cameron gently urged him to stop, and then forcibly tried to make him. But these efforts were futile.  Warren worked with slow, ceaseless, methodical movement.  He toiled for what seemed hours. Cameron, seeing the darkening, dampening sand, realized a wonderful possibility of water, and he plunged into the pit with the other half of the canteen.  Then both men toiled, round and round the wide hole, down deeper and deeper.  The sand grew moist, then wet.  At the bottom of the deep pit the sand coarsened, gave place to gravel. Finally water welled in, a stronger volume than Cameron ever remembered finding on the desert.  It would soon fill the hole and run over.  He marveled at the circumstance.  The time was near the end of the dry season. Perhaps an underground stream flowed from the range behind down to the valley floor, and at this point came near to the surface.  Cameron had heard of such desert miracles.  The finding of water revived Cameron's flagging hopes.  But they were short-lived.  Warren had spend himself utterly.  \"I'm done.  Don't linger,\" he whispered.  \"My son, go--go!\"  Then he fell.  Cameron dragged him out of the sand pit to a sheltered place under the ledge.  While sitting beside the failing man Cameron discovered painted images on the wall.  Often in the desert he had found these evidences of a prehistoric people.  Then, from long habit, he picked up a piece of rock and examined it. Its weight made him closely scrutinize it.  The color was a peculiar black.  He scraped through the black rust to find a piece of gold.  Around him lay scattered heaps of black pebbles and bits of black, weathered rock and pieces of broken ledge, and they showed gold.  \"Warren!  Look!  See it!  Feel it!  Gold!\"  But Warren had never cared, and now he was too blind to see.  \"Go--go!\" he whispered.  Cameron gazed down the gray reaches of the forlorn valley, and something within him that was neither intelligence nor emotion--something inscrutably strange--impelled him to promise.  Then Cameron built up stone monuments to mark his gold strike.  That done, he tarried beside the unconscious Warren.  Moments passed--grew into hours.  Cameron still had strength left to make an effort to get out of the desert.  But that same inscrutable something which had ordered his strange involuntary promise to Warren held him beside his fallen comrade.  He watched the white sun turn to gold, and then to red and sink behind mountains in the west.  Twilight stole into the arroyo. It lingered, slowly turning to gloom. The vault of blue black lightened to the blinking of stars. Then fell the serene, silent, luminous desert night.  Cameron kept his vigil.  As the long hours wore on he felt creep over him the comforting sense that he need not forever fight sleep. A wan glow flared behind the dark, uneven horizon, and a melancholy misshapen moon rose to make the white night one of shadows.  Absolute silence claimed the desert.  It was mute.  Then that inscrutable something breathed to him, telling him when he was alone.  He need not have looked at the dark, still face beside him.  Another face haunted Cameron's--a woman's face.  It was there in the white moonlit shadows; it drifted in the darkness beyond; it softened, changed to that of a young girl, sweet, with the same dark, haunting eyes of her mother.  Cameron prayed to that nameless thing within him, the spirit of something deep and mystical as life.  He prayed to that nameless thing outside, of which the rocks and the sand, the spiked cactus and the ragged lava, the endless waste, with its vast star-fired mantle, were but atoms.  He prayed for mercy to a woman--for happiness to her child.  Both mother and daughter were close to him then.  Time and distance were annihilated. He had faith--he saw into the future. The fateful threads of the past, so inextricably woven with his error, wound out their tragic length here in this forlorn desert.  Cameron then took a little tin box from his pocket, and, opening it, removed a folded certificate.  He had kept a pen, and now he wrote something upon the paper, and in lieu of ink he wrote with blood.  The moon afforded him enough light to see; and, having replaced the paper, he laid the little box upon a shelf of rock. It would remain there unaffected by dust, moisture, heat, time. How long had those painted images been there clear and sharp on the dry stone walls?  There were no trails in that desert, and always there were incalculable changes. Cameron saw this mutable mood of nature--the sands would fly and seep and carve and bury; the floods would dig and cut; the ledges would weather in the heat and rain; the avalanches would slide; the cactus seeds would roll in the wind to catch in a niche and split the soil with thirsty roots.  Years would pass.  Cameron seemed to see them, too; and likewise destiny leading a child down into this forlorn waste, where she would find love and fortune, and the grave of her father.  Cameron covered the dark, still face of his comrade from the light of the waning moon.  That action was the severing of his hold on realities.  They fell away from him in final separation.  Vaguely, dreamily he seemed to behold his soul.  Night merged into gray day; and night came again, weird and dark.  Then up out of the vast void of the desert, from the silence and illimitableness, trooped his phantoms of peace. Majestically they formed around him, marshalling and"]]]
