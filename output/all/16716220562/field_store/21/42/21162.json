And the ocean's full of things I haven't seen yet. I don't _want_ to grow down!\"  Mater paled with shock. Pater gave his spawn a scalding, scandalized look. \"You'll learn! You can't beat Biology,\" he said thickly, creditably keeping his voice down. \"Junior, you may go!\"  Junior bobbled off, and Pater admonished Mater sternly, \"We must have patience, my dear! All children pass through these larval stages....\"  \"Yes, dear,\" sighed Mater.         *       *       *       *       *  At long last, Junior seemed to have resigned himself to making the best of it.  With considerable exertions, hampered by his increasing bottom-heaviness, he was fetching loads of stones, seaweed and other debris to a spot downslope, and there laboring over what promised to be a fairly ambitious cairn. Judging by what they could see of it, his homesite might even prove a credit to the colony (so went Pater's thoughts) and attract a mate who would be a good catch (thus Mater mused).  Junior was still to be seen at times along the reef in company with his free-swimming friends among the other polyps, at some of whom his parents had always looked askance, fearing they were by no means well-bred. In fact, there was strong suspicion that some of them--waifs from the disreputable Shallows district in the hazardous reaches just below the tide-mark--had never been bred at all, but were products of budding, a practice frowned on in polite society.  However, Junior's appearance and rate of locomotion made it clear he would soon be done with juvenile follies. As Pater repeated with satisfaction--you can't beat Biology; as one becomes more and more bottle-shaped, the romantic illusions of youth must inevitably perish.  \"I always knew there was sound stuff in the youngster,\" declared Pater expansively.  \"At least he won't be able to go around with those ragamuffins much longer,\" breathed Mater thankfully.  \"What does the young fool think he's doing, fiddling round with soapstone?\" grumbled Pater, peering critically through the green to try to make out the details of Junior's building. \"Doesn't he know it's apt to slip its place in a year or two?\"  \"Look, dear,\" hissed Mater acidly, \"isn't that the little polyp who was so rude once?... I wish she wouldn't keep watching Junior like that. Our northwest neighbor heard _positively_ that she's the child of an only parent!\"  \"Never mind.\" Pater turned to reassure her. \"Once Junior is properly rooted, his self-respect will cause him to keep riffraff at a distance. It's a matter of Psychology, my dear; the vertical position makes all the difference in one's thinking.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The great day arrived. Laboriously Junior put a few finishing touches to his construction--which, so far as could be seen from a distance, had turned out decent-looking enough, though it was rather questionably original in design: lower and flatter than was customary.  With one more look at his handiwork, Junior turned bottom-end-down and sank wearily onto the finished site. After a minute, he paddled experimentally, but flailing tentacles failed to lift him. He was already rooted, and growing more solidly so by the moment.  \"Congratulations!\" cried the neighbors. Pater and Mater bowed this way and that in acknowledgment. Mater waved a condescending tentacle to the three maiden aunts.  \"I told you so!\" said Pater triumphantly.  \"Yes, dear....\" said Mater meekly.  Suddenly there were outcries of alarm from the dwellers down-reef. A wave of dismay swept audibly through all the nearer part of the colony. Pater and Mater looked around, and froze.  Junior had begun paddling again, but this time in a most peculiar manner--with a rotary twist and sidewise scoop which looked awkward, but which he performed so deftly that he must have practiced it. Fixed upright as he was now on the platform he had built, he looked for all the world as if he were trying to swim sidewise.  \"He's gone _mad_!\" squeaked Mater.  \"I ...\" gulped Pater, \"I'm afraid not.\"  At least, they saw, there was method in Junior's actions. He went on paddling in the same fashion and now he, and his platform with him, were farther away than they had been, and growing more remote as they stared.         *       *       *       *       *  Parts of the homesite that was not a homesite revolved in some way incomprehensible to eyes that had never seen the like. And the whole affair trundled along, rocking at bumps in the sandy bottom, and squeaking painfully; nevertheless, it moved.  The polyps watching from the reef swam out and frolicked after Junior, watching his contrivance go and chattering eager questions, while their parents bawled at them to keep away from that.  The three maiden aunts shrieked faintly and swooned in one another's tentacles. The colony was shaken as it had not been since the tidal wave.  \"COME BACK!\" thundered Pater. \"You CAN'T do that!\"  \"_Come back!_\" shrilled Mater. \"You can't do _that_!\"  \"Come back!\" gabbled the neighbors. \"You can't _do_ that!\"  But Junior was past listening to reason. Junior was on wheels."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49823"],["title","Batik and Other Pattern Dyeing (#0)"],["body","AND OTHER         PATTERN DYEING                 BY       WALTER DAVIS BAKER               AND        IDA STRAWN BAKER                OF      THE WALDCRAFT STUDIOS      INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA            [Decoration]                1920   ATKINSON, MENTZER & COMPANY             CHICAGO          COPYRIGHT 1920 BY   ATKINSON, MENTZER & COMPANY        ALL RIGHTS RESERVED     THE CONTENTS       I     History and Character of Batiks                         11      II     The Principles of Dyeing Fabrics                        35      III     Wax Resist Processes                                    54      IV     Batiks and Other Illuminated Textiles                   75      V     Dyeing for Plays and Pageants                           97      VI     Tie-Dyed Work                                          109      VII     Stick Printing, Block Printing and Stencil Dyeing      123     THE PREFACE   One of the hopeful observations during the few years of applied art education in our schools has been the readiness with which educators have taken up and kept problems in which the mediums of expression were practical and efficient, suitable for the purpose intended, and the equal readiness with which they have dropped other problems.  The burning of wood as a means of decoration did not stand this test, therefore it had to go. Oil paint is not a suitable medium to decorate textiles, therefore it too has nearly fallen from use.  The value of applied art to home and community rests upon the test, whether the pupil who works out the problems becomes by virtue thereof a more useful and cultured individual in the home and in the social and industrial life of the community.  A problem which satisfies this test becomes a basic problem. To a pupil who has once bound a book with its cover design, end papers, etc., a book is a different thing ever after. He becomes a more intelligent and cultured member of the consuming public so far as books are concerned. To the demands of many such members the book binders respond with better things. Therefore book binding is a basic problem.  Similar reasoning applies when a student weaves a fabric, plans and makes an article of dress, a toy, a silver ring, or a poster.  No one will dispute that the all-over dyeing of a fabric, and the decoration of a textile with a dyed pattern, are basic problems. The recent war brought home the vital place that dyes hold in the life of the people.  As suitable materials have become available teachers have been eager to learn and use these problems.  It is seldom that an applied problem comes to the art teacher that offers in so full a measure the essential features of a basic problem as does batik work, which involves both all-over and pattern dyeing.  The mechanical process is rather simple and offers no especial difficulty, requiring only the painstaking care that good teachers exact from pupils.  The design element involved may be simple or elaborate, fitted to the capacity of the pupil. It is a real problem in design, however, allowing great freedom yet carrying with it the discipline of a later test, viz., applied expression within the limitations of definite mediums.  As the process controls the entire surface, the pupil is directed to plan his design and ground areas both in space and color relations. The mediums used are fabrics and dyes, both inseparably involved in education as they are in life. The pupil must plan for the use intended and also for the particular type of individual or scheme of decoration.  The work carries with it all along the anticipation of results; and the beautiful finished piece is the reward of effort. What more could be desired in an applied school problem?  The endeavor and the hope in presenting this little book on \"Batik and Other Pattern Dyeing\" is to help those who are learning to undertake these problems with breadth of thought and efficiency of method.

Personal adornment was perhaps the first attempt at expressing beauty. Costume designing and textile industries are still most vital movements in the artistic development of the people.    [Illustration: {BUDDHA STATUE} {p. 11}]  Asia is the great mother of beauty in textile decoration. We do not talk or write about textiles without using the words of her ancient peoples.  \"Batik\"--this ancient Asiatic word--is one of the oldest crafts of the Orient. In India, Java and Japan the highest technique is reached. These people have made a great art of costuming. Each caste, religion and festival requires its special garment.  From the historic days when Columbus searched vainly for a shorter way to the fabled riches of the East Indies until the way was found, these treasure islands held the possessions most coveted by the Western World.  More than a thousand years before this time, the neighboring Hindus came to these rich islands bringing with them religious teachers, road makers and skilled craftsmen. Many expeditions fastened upon the native tribes the religion and culture of the older and more civilized country.  While the Spanish, Portuguese and English adventurers were discovering new lands and claiming them for their kings, the Dutch sailors carried to and fro the produce of the world. The Netherland warehouses were filled with treasures of the Orient.  Keeping pace with its industry were the universities and the common schools. The records and drawings of Dutch scholars disclose so much detailed information upon the handicraft industries of the day that the recent revival of batik is traced to their genius.  Books issued by the Dutch Government to promote the batik craft, picture Javanese women and girls seated upon fiber mats before a vertical frame upon which the material is hung for the execution of their art. Men too are at work printing and dyeing these fabrics. Housewives in staid processionals display the occupation. Princes and fine ladies disport their gorgeous costumes. Priests climbing the steps of their temples past the long rows of their sacred gods are resplendent in batik array. Their oldest gods are clothed in sculptured batik.  Designs of great beauty and skilled execution enrich the pages of these rare volumes.  Among the Dutch people much effort has been made to promote this art. Native designs have been fostered and the modifications have been in demand for European trade.    [Illustration: COSTUME OF AN UPPER CLASS JAVANESE WOMAN {p. 13}]  The American adaptation of batik has followed closely upon the European revival.  The Chinese, however, have control of the industry in Java. They employ natives at low wage to make batiks. The home occupation that took no account of time or pains is dying out. In a few years the products of this infinitely better craft will be found only in museums and in the possession of collectors. Under Chinese management batik making has become the leading occupation.  Batik is a method of drawing or painting with wax upon a fabric, after which the material is dyed and the wax removed. The result of this process is a decoration in silhouette upon the dyed background of the goods.  The wax generally used in Java is hot beeswax or a vegetable wax imported from Japan. The wax is removed by scraping and melting. The waxing is repeated as many times as there are colors in the design. The process is long and tedious and often requires months.  Formerly the colors were native vegetable dyes. The most common were indigo, mango tree bark and madder. These colors have fallen into disuse, artificial dyes having replaced them.  The wax resists the action of the dye-bath except where it cracks. Here the dye creeps in, producing the characteristic \"crackle\" of"]]]
