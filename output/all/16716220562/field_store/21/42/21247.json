Cold, common sense would go flying out the window, and all that would be left would be the savage lust to butcher and slaughter.  And so Dawson half stood up, and tore off his tunic.  \"It's the truth, _Herr_ Miller!\" he shouted, and started to rip open the seams. \"Take a look, stupid! You see anything hidden in the lining? Take a look and weep, you fathead. See any sealed envelope? See anything that interests you? I told you that I left it aboard. Okay! See for yourself. Here! Take a darned good look!\"  As Dawson spoke the last he held out his ripped tunic with his hands. He practically shoved it right under the Nazi's nose. And then, as the German automatically looked down at it, the Yank air ace practically exploded in a whirlwind of action. He flung the tunic straight into the Nazi's face. He slapped down his right hand, caught the Luger by the barrel and twisted it free. His other fist he smashed to the German's jaw, and one knee he brought up hard into the Nazi's belly. And then, in what was practically a continuation of the original movement, he reversed the Luger in his hand, half turned, and drilled a single shot at the pop-eyed Nazi sailor. The bullet hit the steel plate right behind the sailor's left ear. And that was close enough. His own gun dropped from his fingers, as he flung both hands high in terrified surrender. And the Luger had hardly struck the deck before Freddy Farmer had dived from a sitting position on the metal bench and scooped it up. But Dawson didn't see that fast bit of action. He didn't because he was busy clipping _Herr_ Miller one for good measure on the back of the skull as the man fell down. That done with, he shot a look over at Freddy Farmer and grinned broadly.  \"Nice going, pal!\" he chuckled. \"But I'll give you a kiss later. We've got things to do, right now. Okay, you fellows. Get behind Farmer and me. Maybe that shot of mine was heard, and we haven't got time to lose.\"  \"But, good grief, Dawson!\" Squadron Leader Hixon gasped out. \"What in the world can you do? There must be thirty Nazis, at least, aboard this thing, man!\"  \"That's right!\" Dawson shot back at him. \"And I'll bet not one of them has any hankering to drown! Catch on? Okay. Stick close while Freddy and I rush the central control room. Okay, sailor! Step along ahead of me!\"  As Dawson spoke the last he whipped out his free hand and caught the scared stiff sailor by the arm, and yanked him over and shoved him through the compartment door leading to amidships. He and Freddy Farmer kept right at the German's heels. Like blockers running interference for a ball carrier, they went charging into the central control room. Dawson saw the U-boat commander turn from his post at the periscope sight. He saw the anger that flooded the Nazi's face as he recognized the sailor, and right after that the look of dumbfounded fear that glazed the man's eyes as he caught sight of Dawson and Freddy Farmer right behind.  Perhaps it was just a nervous twitch of the U-boat commander's hand. Or perhaps he actually did start to reach up for his holstered Luger. At any rate, Dawson didn't wait to find out which. He squeezed the trigger of the Luger he held in his own hand, and the bullet snipped a button off the German's jacket before it smacked into the radio panel on the far side of the control room.  \"Don't move, anybody!\" Dawson thundered in German. \"Get stupid, any one of you square-heads, and we'll all go to the bottom, to stay for good. I--\"  The Yank choked off the rest, half turned, and fired the Luger. A thin-faced, hawk-nosed junior officer had tried to snatch up a gun and shoot across his chest at Dawson. His gun didn't even have a chance to go off. Dawson's bullet caught him in the chest, spun him like a top, and dumped him flat on his face, to stay there motionless.  \"Anybody else want to play?\" the Yank grated, and swept his eyes over the four or five other Germans in the control room. \"Suits me swell, if you want to. So just start something. Go ahead, you Nazi slobs!\"  There was a moment of silence, save for the whine of the electric motors driving the U-boat down below the surface. Then its commander made sounds in his throat and licked his lips.  \"What do you want?\" he choked out. \"You are prisoners. Not one of you will live to tell of this madness.\"  At that moment, and for reasons that Dawson couldn't even understand, a flood of war memories swept across the screen of his brain. He remembered scenes of Nazi-slaughtered men, women, and children. He remembered scenes in which houses, villages, and mighty cities had been laid flat in smoking, stinking ruins by the Nazi hordes. He recalled the floating dead bodies of Yank, British, and other United Nations seamen from ship upon ship sent diving to the bottom by Hitler's ruthless U-boat commanders. A hundred scenes of horror and death that made the rage seem to freeze like lumps of ice within him. Lips tight and eyes hard, he stepped over to the U-boat commander and gun-whipped him with the Luger across each cheek.  \"Dry up, rat!\" he grated as the Nazi reeled back, moaning with pain. \"Just get this steel fish up on the surface, or I'll put one right between your fishy eyes. Come on! Snap out your orders! And don't get the idea I don't understand German. You get us top-side, and pronto, or we'll wreck this tub, and all go down together. Step on it, you. Top-side we go, and in a hurry!\"  The German shook and shivered, and tried desperately to summon what little courage he had left. But true to the German type, when he no longer held the whip hand there was nothing but cowardly yellowness to him. And he almost fainted with fright as Dawson suddenly drew a bead on a point square between his eyes.  \"Don't! Don't shoot!\" he sobbed out. \"I will do as you ask. I will give the order to surface the U-boat.\"  \"And tell everybody to stay right where they are at their posts, too!\" Dawson barked at him. \"The first Jerry to stick his face inside this control room will get you a slug right in your fat face. Get it? Okay! Do your stuff!\"  The U-boat commander trembled some more, then picked up the inter-com phone and gave the necessary orders. Dawson watched him like a hawk, and with ears tuned to every German word the man spoke into the inter-com. Then, when the U-boat trembled and started up by the bow, a great sense of joyous relief flooded through him. But he didn't let any of it show for an instant on his face, or in the agate hard eyes he kept fixed on the U-boat commander. He didn't worry about the other Germans in the central control room, because he knew that Freddy Farmer was keeping an eye on them. As a matter of fact, at just about that same moment he felt rather than saw his English pal at his elbow. And then he heard Freddy's quiet voice.  \"What a shame you've already received all the medals they give out in this war, Dave,\" the English youth chuckled. \"Certainly deserve one for this little bit. Though, of course, it didn't actually happen, you know. Just a mad dream!\"  \"You telling me, sweetheart?\" Dave shot out of the corner of his mouth. \"I won't even ever believe this, myself. But keep your eye on those other birds. They might dive for their--\"  \"Hardly!\" Freddy Farmer interrupted. \"I've collected all their guns. I'll show them to you sometime when you're not so busy.\"  \"Do that, pal,\" Dave chuckled. \"And get set to crank open that conning tower hatch just as soon as we hit surface. There might be a plane or two up there cruising around. Or maybe a British destroyer.\"  \"What a cheerful chap!\" Freddy groaned. \"And do I hope you're all wrong about _that_!\"     CHAPTER SEVEN  _Yankee Bluff_   The next few moments seemed to Dawson to be year upon year stretching slowly out to their fullest extent of time. During every ticking second he kept his gaze fixed steadfastly on the U-boat commander, and held the Luger in his hand steady and ready for instant action, if need be. However, there was no need for that kind of action. Perhaps the German read the truth in the Yank's agate eyes, and realized beyond all possible doubt that Dawson would squeeze the trigger of the Luger, if he was forced to, just as sure as the Lord made little apples. Or perhaps the Nazi was still so paralyzed with fear that he couldn't have moved a single muscle, if he'd wanted to, but could only stand there at the periscope's base sight, and stare with glazed eyes back at the man who had him covered.  And then suddenly, the German seaman at the depth gauge board grunted out the fact that the U-boat was awash on the surface. Dawson didn't turn his head to glance over at him. He still kept his eyes fixed on the commander, and spoke out of the corner of his mouth.  \"Okay, Freddy,\" he said. \"You, and Squadron Leader Hixon, and a couple of the others go top-side, pronto. Yell back down if you see anything. Better take along a couple of those flares, even if it is daylight. The two who don't go up with you can park down here and help me keep these rats in line. Give them each one of the guns from your collection.\"  \"Right-o, Dave!\" the English youth replied. \"I'll go top-side and take a look. But if I don't see anything, I think we'd better make use of their radio, what?\"  \"Bright lad,\" Dawson grunted. \"Okay, get set.\"  As the Yank spoke the last he leaned forward slightly so that the muzzle of his Luger was just a few inches closer to the spot square between the U-boat commander's eyes.  \"Up conning tower hatch, you!\" he grated out. \"And if we _aren't_ on the surface, it's going to be just as tough for you as for the rest of us. So--\"  Dave chopped off the rest, swung his Luger in a short arc and squeezed the trigger. A bull-necked Nazi sailor charging through a door behind the commander took the bullet smack in the chest and fell down in a heap. A gun he had half raised bounced when it hit the steel deck, and went skidding away. Dawson swung "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50259"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Flying Tigers (#8)"],["body","eyes back to the senior officer, who was now having all kinds of difficulty keeping his knees from buckling.  \"Catch on?\" Dawson snapped. \"I never kid, stupid, when I make a promise. And I made one to you. Remember? Okay! Up with that conning tower hatch!\"  The Nazi could only bob his head up and down violently. Then the words poured off his lips like raging flood waters going over a broken dam.  \"I do not lie, _Herr_ Captain!\" he gasped out. \"We are on the surface. Yes, yes! It is so. I would be a fool to drown us all by ordering the hatch to be opened while we are still below the surface. I would be mad to do that. I do not wish to die--that way!\"  \"Well, there are other ways, if you don't snap it up!\" the Yank reminded him with a significant gesture of the Luger. \"So step on it, my little Nazi tramp. Step on it!\"  The U-boat commander did just that, but during the few seconds it took to issue orders and get the hatch open Dawson's heart stood still, and he held his breath clamped in his lungs. After all, there was just a wild chance that the commander did have a little stiffness in his backbone! However, the man had had more than enough. And like all of his type, when it came to the matter of his own life, he could change from a blustering, arrogant hireling of Hitler to a cringing, sniveling whimperer in practically nothing flat.  And so he did just as he was ordered, and presently the conning tower hatch was opened, and clean, fresh ocean air was pouring down inside to cut the thick, heavy U-boat stench.  \"Stop daydreaming, pal!\" Dawson snapped, as Freddy Farmer made no move toward the companion ladder. \"Get up there and do your stuff, in case somebody has already sighted us. I sure don't want to be kissed now by any made-in-England depth bomb. Scram!\"  \"You go, Dave,\" the English youth argued. \"You've earned a smell of fresh air. I'll watch these blasted Jerries.\"  \"Nothing doing!\" the Yank snapped. \"Up with you. This is more fun, see? Maybe some other dope will stick his head through a door. I can do with a little side-arms practice. Get going!\"  Freddy didn't bother arguing after that. With Squadron Leader Hixon, and a couple of the Lockheed's crew, he went scrambling up the companion ladder, and out onto the conning tower bridge. Down below, Dawson and the remaining two of the Lockheed's crew kept their eyes and their captured Lugers fixed on the Germans in the central control room. Seconds ticked by to add up to a minute. And the minutes added up to total three, then four. Tension began to tell on Dawson, and a whole flock of little worries and doubts began to play about in his brain. True, he was standing guard over the \"nerve center\" of the U-boat. And true, his prisoners were the commander and his junior officers. Just the same, he couldn't hope to keep the situation just as it was indefinitely. Maybe the commander and his officers were cringing cowards, but that didn't guarantee that it was the same with every member of the U-boat's crew. Maybe there was a hero or two among them who would rather take death than capture and imprisonment. Or, at least, perhaps there was one among them who might crack easily. One who might go clean off his nut, and do anything, such as open the sea valves, to break the terrific, tormenting strain. And whether a brave hero or a man gone mad opened the sea valves and let the ocean come pouring in, the _result_ would be the same!  And so, as each new second ticked by, another little bead of cold, clammy sweat formed on Dawson's forehead. And with each passing instant of time he had to battle harder to keep from showing his nervousness by yelling up to Freddy Farmer to find out if anything had been sighted. Finally, when his nerves were so tightly drawn that they threatened to snap and fly off in small pieces at almost any second, he suddenly heard the welcoming sound of the English youth's voice.  \"Cheerio, Dave, old thing!\" Freddy shouted down the hatch. \"Luck of the Devil for us, for fair. The King's Navy, no less, Dave, my lad. What a beautiful sight to see, and--\"  \"Save it!\" Dawson roared back at him. \"What in thunder _do_ you see?\"  \"A British cruiser, of course!\" the English youth told him. \"Didn't I say the King's Navy? Well, there she is, and coming right for us. Happy days are here again, what?\"  Dawson gave a little shake of his head, and dropped the crazy conversation. He realized that Farmer's joy at sighting a British cruiser, which had come up out of nowhere, had sent him just a little joyously haywire for the moment. As a matter of fact, Dawson's own head felt a little light, and he almost smiled at the U-boat commander as he jerked his head upward and gave the order.  \"Top-side for you!\" he said in German. \"A British cruiser is bearing down toward us. Get up there and get an eyeful. Hey, Freddy! Stupid is coming up! Keep your eye on him. I'll be up in a minute.\"  Right after he had shouted the last in English to Freddy Farmer up on the conning tower bridge, Dave turned to the two members of the Lockheed's crew who had remained below decks with him, and gave them a happy grin and a nod.  \"Okay, up you go, too,\" he said. \"And thanks for giving me a hand down here. Too bad we didn't get some--\"  \"Watch it, sir!\" screamed one of the R.A.F. men. \"Down with you!\"  Dawson had already dropped low and twisted around. He saw the blurred figure of _Herr_ Miller charging toward him, and saw the Nazi's outstretched hand spit flame and smoke. Something plucked at his tunic sleeve, and almost spun him around. His feet were too well braced, however. And in the next split second the sound of his own gun blended with the crack of the guns held by the two R.A.F. men. All three bullets hit _Herr_ Miller, and the man was stone dead before his feet left the deck as he went toppling over backwards, and down. Dawson swallowed hard and glanced down at the bullet hole in his tunic sleeve.  \"Thanks for the yell,\" he said to the man who had given the alarm. \"And thank God he was a rotten shot. Tough that he's dead, though. I've had the hunch that he was Gestapo. I'd hoped to take him alive and learn a thing or two. But maybe it's just as well that he's that way. One less rat to worry about. Well, let's go.\"  Dawson motioned the other two up the companion ladder, and then, after barking a cautioning word or two to the live Germans still in the central control room, he backed slowly up the companion ladder and then quickly scrambled out of the hatch and onto the bridge. In a flash Freddy Farmer was by his side and pointing excitedly at a British cruiser standing off about a quarter of a mile to starboard while it launched one of its motorboats.  And a little over fifteen minutes later another of Hitler's U-boats had made its last trip, a trip that took it straight down to the bottom of the North Atlantic. Its officers and crew were prisoners of war aboard the cruiser. And in the cruiser captain's quarters, Squadron Leader Hixon was giving a glowing account of all that had happened.  \"It was Captain Dawson all the way, I fancy, sir,\" he finished up with a grin. \"The rest of us were simply the audience. But an audience that will never forget his performance, you can be sure. Fact is, when I return to England I'm certainly going to recommend that he be mentioned in Orders, and be cited for a decoration. Truth to tell, sir, it was all so incredibly wonderful that I'm still wondering a little if it actually did happen.\"  \"Well, if it's all right with you, sir,\" Dawson spoke up, his face flaming red with embarrassment, \"let's just say that it didn't, and forget the whole thing. Frankly, it was just bluff, and a barrel of luck. Those two things, plus Jerry brains that can't turn over very fast in the clinches. So if it's all the same to you, sir, I'd--\"  Dawson let the rest hang in the air as there came an urgent knock on the door, and the senior radio officer came in with a yellow slip of paper in his hand.  \"An answer from your report to the Admiralty, sir,\" he said, and handed the yellow slip of paper to the senior officer. \"But it's from the Air Ministry, sir.\"  Dawson and Farmer unconsciously stiffened, and exchanged glances. Then they looked at the cruiser's captain. The officer scowled at the yellow slip for a moment, then looked up quickly to meet their gaze.  \"Seems that you two chaps were in a bit of a hurry, what?\" he said with a faint smile, and tapped the paper with the fingers of his other hand. \"This is a special radio request from the Air Ministry--a request to launch you two chaps off in one of our planes, and let you finish your journey by air. A bit of courier work, eh?\"  Dawson almost shook his head, but just in time he recalled his little bluff scene with _Herr_ Miller in that empty torpedo store chamber aboard the U-boat. At that time Squadron Leader Hixon and the others had of course tumbled to the fact that he and Freddy were supposed to be carrying something of importance--something that _Herr_ Miller had been ready to kill to obtain. So it would be silly to deny it now.  \"Yes, sir,\" he said instead. \"Yes, you might call it that, sir. But how did the Air Ministry--\"  \"Find out about your rescue?\" the cruiser's captain interrupted with a chuckle. \"Routine, I fancy. Any reports on our aircraft, and flying personnel, we radio to the Admiralty are immediately telephoned over to the Air Ministry. Obviously the Air Ministry wants you to get on with the job at once, and can't wait for us to get to the States. Hence, this request.\"  \"And--and are you granting it, sir?\" Dawson asked as casually as his inner eagerness would permit.  The cruiser's captain looked stern, and scowled darkly. And then, perhaps because of the fading hope he saw in Dawson's eyes, he smiled broadly, and nodded.  \"I fancy so,\" he said. \"After all, you two chaps have got just so much _leave_ coming, you know. Haven't the heart to make you spend any more of it than you have to aboard my ship."]]]
