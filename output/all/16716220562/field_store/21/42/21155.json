She kep' me jumpin' tryin' to answer her! Of all the queer children I ever come across she's the queerest. She ain't no beauty--her face is all eyes; but if she ever grows up to them eyes an' fills out a little she'll make folks stare. Land, mother! I wish 't you could 'a' heard her talk.\"  \"I don't see what she had to talk about, a child like that, to a stranger,\" replied Mrs. Cobb.  \"Stranger or no stranger, 't wouldn't make no difference to her. She'd talk to a pump or a grind-stun; she'd talk to herself ruther 'n keep still.\"  \"What did she talk about?\"  \"Blamed if I can repeat any of it. She kep' me so surprised I didn't have my wits about me. She had a little pink sunshade--it kind o' looked like a doll's amberill, 'n' she clung to it like a burr to a woolen stockin'. I advised her to open it up--the sun was so hot; but she said no, 't would fade, an' she tucked it under her dress. 'It's the dearest thing in life to me,' says she, 'but it's a dreadful care.' Them 's the very words, an' it's all the words I remember. 'It's the dearest thing in life to me, but it's an awful care!' \"--here Mr. Cobb laughed aloud as he tipped his chair back against the side of the house. \"There was another thing, but I can't get it right exactly. She was talkin' 'bout the circus parade an' the snake charmer in a gold chariot, an' says she, 'She was so beautiful beyond compare, Mr. Cobb, that it made you have lumps in your throat to look at her.' She'll be comin' over to see you, mother, an' you can size her up for yourself. I don' know how she'll git on with Mirandy Sawyer--poor little soul!\"  This doubt was more or less openly expressed in Riverboro, which, however, had two opinions on the subject; one that it was a most generous thing in the Sawyer girls to take one of Aurelia's children to educate, the other that the education would be bought at a price wholly out of proportion to its intrinsic value.  Rebecca's first letters to her mother would seem to indicate that she cordially coincided with the latter view of the situation.    IV  REBECCA'S POINT OF VIEW      Dear Mother,--I am safely here. My dress was not much tumbled     and Aunt Jane helped me press it out. I like Mr. Cobb very     much. He chews but throws newspapers straight up to the     doors. I rode outside a little while, but got inside before I     got to Aunt Miranda's house. I did not want to, but thought     you would like it better. Miranda is such a long word that I     think I will say Aunt M. and Aunt J. in my Sunday letters.     Aunt J. has given me a dictionary to look up all the hard     words in. It takes a good deal of time and I am glad people     can talk without stoping to spell. It is much eesier to talk     than write and much more fun. The brick house looks just the     same as you have told us. The parler is splendid and gives     you creeps and chills when you look in the door. The     furnature is ellergant too, and all the rooms but there are     no good sitting-down places exsept in the kitchen. The same     cat is here but they do not save kittens when she has them,     and the cat is too old to play with. Hannah told me once you     ran away with father and I can see it would be nice. If Aunt     M. would run away I think I should like to live with Aunt J.     She does not hate me as bad as Aunt M. does. Tell Mark he can     have my paint box, but I should like him to keep the red cake     in case I come home again. I hope Hannah and John do not get     tired doing my chores.      Your afectionate friend      Rebecca.      P. S. Please give the piece of poetry to John because he     likes my poetry even when it is not very good. This piece is     not very good but it is true but I hope you won't mind what     is in it as you ran away.         This house is dark and dull and dreer        No light doth shine from far or near            Its like the tomb.         And those of us who live herein        Are most as dead as serrafim            Though not as good.         My gardian angel is asleep        At leest he doth no vigil keep         Ah! woe is me!         Then give me back my lonely farm        Where none alive did wish me harm            Dear home of youth!      P. S. again. I made the poetry like a piece in a book but     could not get it right at first. You see \"tomb\" and \"good\" do     not sound well together but I wanted to say \"tomb\" dreadfully     and as serrafim are always \"good\" I couldn't take that out. I     have made it over now. It does not say my thoughts as well     but think it is more right. Give the best one to John as he     keeps them in a box with his birds' eggs. This is the best     one.         SUNDAY THOUGHTS               BY        REBECCA ROWENA RANDALL        This house is dark and dull and drear       No light doth shine from far or near           Nor ever could.        And those of us who live herein       Are most as dead as seraphim           Though not as good.        My guardian angel is asleep       At least he doth no vigil keep           But far doth roam.        Then give me back my lonely farm       Where none alive did wish me harm,           Dear childhood home!       Dear Mother,--I am thrilling with unhappyness this morning. I     got that out of Cora The Doctor's Wife whose husband's mother     was very cross and unfealing to her like Aunt M. to me. I     wish Hannah had come instead of me for it was Hannah that was     wanted and she is better than I am and does not answer back     so quick. Are there any peaces of my buff calico. Aunt J.     wants enough to make a new waste button behind so I wont look     so outlandish. The stiles are quite pretty in Riverboro and     those at Meeting quite ellergant more so than in Temperance.        This town is stilish, gay and fair,       And full of wellthy riches rare,       But I would pillow on my arm       The thought of my sweet Brookside Farm.      School is pretty good. The Teacher can answer more questions     than the Temperance one but not so many as I can ask. I am     smarter than all the girls but one but not so smart as two     boys. Emma Jane can add and subtract in her head like a     streek of lightning and knows the speling book right through     but has no thoughts of any kind. She is in the Third Reader     but does not like stories in books. I am in the Sixth Reader     but just because I cannot say the seven multiplication Table     Miss Dearborn threttens to put me in the baby primer class     with Elijah and Elisha Simpson little twins.        Sore is my heart and bent my stubborn pride,       With Lijah and with Lisha am I tied,       My soul recoyles like Cora Doctor's Wife,       Like her I feer I cannot bare this life.       I am going to try for the speling prize but fear I cannot get     it. I would not care but wrong speling looks dreadful in     poetry. Last Sunday when I found seraphim in the dictionary I     was ashamed I had made it serrafim but seraphim is not a word     you can guess at like another long one outlandish in this     letter which spells itself. Miss Dearborn says use the words     you CAN spell and if you cant spell seraphim make angel do     but angels are not just the same as seraphims. Seraphims are     brighter whiter and have bigger wings and I think are older     and longer dead than angels which are just freshly dead and     after a long time in heaven around the great white throne     grow to be seraphims.      I sew on brown gingham dresses every afternoon when Emma Jane     and the Simpsons are playing house or running on the Logs     when their mothers do not know it. Their mothers are afraid     they will drown and Aunt M. is afraid I will wet my clothes     so will not let me either. I can play from half past four to     supper and after supper a little bit and Saturday afternoons.     I am glad our cow has a calf and it is spotted. It is going     to be a good year for apples and hay so you and John will be     glad and we can pay a little more morgage. Miss Dearborn     asked us what is the object of edducation and I said the     object of mine was to help pay off the morgage. She told Aunt     M. and I had to sew extra for punishment because she says a     morgage is disgrace like stealing or smallpox and it will be     all over town that we have one on our farm. Emma Jane is not     morgaged nor Richard Carter nor Dr. Winship but the Simpsons     are.        Rise my soul, strain every nerve,       Thy morgage to remove,       Gain thy mother's heartfelt thanks       Thy family's grateful love.      Pronounce family QUICK or it won't sound right      Your loving little friend     Rebecca       Dear John,--You remember when we tide the new dog in the barn     how he bit the rope and howled I am just like him only the     brick house is the barn and I can not bite Aunt M. because I     must be grateful and edducation is going to be the making of     me and help you pay off the morgage when we grow up.     Your loving      Becky.    V  WISDOM'S WAYS  The day of Rebecca's arrival had been Friday, and on the Monday following she began her education at the school which was in Riverboro Centre, about a mile distant. Miss Sawyer borrowed a neighbor's horse and wagon and drove her to the schoolhouse, interviewing the teacher, Miss Dearborn, arranging for books, and generally starting the child on the path that was to lead to boundless knowledge. Miss Dearborn, it may be said in passing, had had no special preparation in the art of teaching. It came to her naturally, so her family said, and perhaps for this reason she, like Tom Tulliver's clergyman tutor, \"set about it with that uniformity of method and independence of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/498"],["title","Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (#6)"],["body","which distinguish the actions of animals understood to be under the immediate teaching of Nature.\" You remember the beaver which a naturalist tells us \"busied himself as earnestly in constructing a dam in a room up three pair of stairs in London as if he had been laying his foundation in a lake in Upper Canada. It was his function to build, the absence of water or of possible progeny was an accident for which he was not accountable.\" In the same manner did Miss Dearborn lay what she fondly imagined to be foundations in the infant mind.  Rebecca walked to school after the first morning. She loved this part of the day's programme. When the dew was not too heavy and the weather was fair there was a short cut through the woods. She turned off the main road, crept through uncle Josh Woodman's bars, waved away Mrs. Carter's cows, trod the short grass of the pasture, with its well-worn path running through gardens of buttercups and white-weed, and groves of ivory leaves and sweet fern. She descended a little hill, jumped from stone to stone across a woodland brook, startling the drowsy frogs, who were always winking and blinking in the morning sun. Then came the \"woodsy bit,\" with her feet pressing the slippery carpet of brown pine needles; the \"woodsy bit\" so full of dewy morning, surprises,--fungous growths of brilliant orange and crimson springing up around the stumps of dead trees, beautiful things born in a single night; and now and then the miracle of a little clump of waxen Indian pipes, seen just quickly enough to be saved from her careless tread. Then she climbed a stile, went through a grassy meadow, slid under another pair of bars, and came out into the road again having gained nearly half a mile.  How delicious it all was! Rebecca clasped her Quackenbos's Grammar and Greenleaf's Arithmetic with a joyful sense of knowing her lessons. Her dinner pail swung from her right hand, and she had a blissful consciousness of the two soda biscuits spread with butter and syrup, the baked cup-custard, the doughnut, and the square of hard gingerbread. Sometimes she said whatever \"piece\" she was going to speak on the next Friday afternoon.    \"A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,    There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of           woman's tears.\"  How she loved the swing and the sentiment of it! How her young voice quivered whenever she came to the refrain:--    \"But we'll meet no more at Bingen, dear Bingen on the Rhine.\"  It always sounded beautiful in her ears, as she sent her tearful little treble into the clear morning air. Another early favorite (for we must remember that Rebecca's only knowledge of the great world of poetry consisted of the selections in vogue in school readers) was:--    \"Woodman, spare that tree!     Touch not a single bough!   In youth it sheltered me,     And I'll protect it now.\"  When Emma Jane Perkins walked through the \"short cut\" with her, the two children used to render this with appropriate dramatic action. Emma Jane always chose to be the woodman because she had nothing to do but raise on high an imaginary axe. On the one occasion when she essayed the part of the tree's romantic protector, she represented herself as feeling \"so awful foolish\" that she refused to undertake it again, much to the secret delight of Rebecca, who found the woodman's role much too tame for her vaulting ambition. She reveled in the impassioned appeal of the poet, and implored the ruthless woodman to be as brutal as possible with the axe, so that she might properly put greater spirit into her lines. One morning, feeling more frisky than usual, she fell upon her knees and wept in the woodman's petticoat. Curiously enough, her sense of proportion rejected this as soon as it was done.  \"That wasn't right, it was silly, Emma Jane; but I'll tell you where it might come in--in Give me Three Grains of Corn. You be the mother, and I'll be the famishing Irish child. For pity's sake put the axe down; you are not the woodman any longer!\"  \"What'll I do with my hands, then?\" asked Emma Jane.  \"Whatever you like,\" Rebecca answered wearily; \"you're just a mother--that's all. What does YOUR mother do with her hands? Now here goes!    \"'Give me three grains of corn, mother,     Only three grains of corn,   'T will keep the little life I have     Till the coming of the morn.'\"  This sort of thing made Emma Jane nervous and fidgety, but she was Rebecca's slave and hugged her chains, no matter how uncomfortable they made her.  At the last pair of bars the two girls were sometimes met by a detachment of the Simpson children, who lived in a black house with a red door and a red barn behind, on the Blueberry Plains road. Rebecca felt an interest in the Simpsons from the first, because there were so many of them and they were so patched and darned, just like her own brood at the home farm.  The little schoolhouse with its flagpole on top and its two doors in front, one for boys and the other for girls, stood on the crest of a hill, with rolling fields and meadows on one side, a stretch of pine woods on the other, and the river glinting and sparkling in the distance. It boasted no attractions within. All was as bare and ugly and uncomfortable as it well could be, for the villages along the river expended so much money in repairing and rebuilding bridges that they were obliged to be very economical in school privileges. The teacher's desk and chair stood on a platform in one corner; there was an uncouth stove, never blackened oftener than once a year, a map of the United States, two black-boards, a ten-quart tin pail of water and long-handled dipper on a corner shelf, and wooden desks and benches for the scholars, who only numbered twenty in Rebecca's time. The seats were higher in the back of the room, and the more advanced and longer-legged pupils sat there, the position being greatly to be envied, as they were at once nearer to the windows and farther from the teacher.  There were classes of a sort, although nobody, broadly speaking, studied the same book with anybody else, or had arrived at the same degree of proficiency in any one branch of learning. Rebecca in particular was so difficult to classify that Miss Dearborn at the end of a fortnight gave up the attempt altogether. She read with Dick Carter and Living Perkins, who were fitting for the academy; recited arithmetic with lisping little Thuthan Thimpthon; geography with Emma Jane Perkins, and grammar after school hours to Miss Dearborn alone. Full to the brim as she was of clever thoughts and quaint fancies, she made at first but a poor hand at composition. The labor of writing and spelling, with the added difficulties of punctuation and capitals, interfered sadly with the free expression of ideas. She took history with Alice Robinson's class, which was attacking the subject of the Revolution, while Rebecca was bidden to begin with the discovery of America. In a week she had mastered the course of events up to the Revolution, and in ten days had arrived at Yorktown, where the class had apparently established summer quarters. Then finding that extra effort would only result in her reciting with the oldest Simpson boy, she deliberately held herself back, for wisdom's ways were not those of pleasantness nor her paths those of peace if one were compelled to tread them in the company of Seesaw Simpson. Samuel Simpson was generally called Seesaw, because of his difficulty in making up his mind. Whether it were a question of fact, of spelling, or of date, of going swimming or fishing, of choosing a book in the Sunday-school library or a stick of candy at the village store, he had no sooner determined on one plan of action than his wish fondly reverted to the opposite one. Seesaw was pale, flaxen haired, blue eyed, round shouldered, and given to stammering when nervous. Perhaps because of his very weakness Rebecca's decision of character had a fascination for him, and although she snubbed him to the verge of madness, he could never keep his eyes away from her. The force with which she tied her shoe when the lacing came undone, the flirt over shoulder she gave her black braid when she was excited or warm, her manner of studying,--book on desk, arms folded, eyes fixed on the opposite wall,--all had an abiding charm for Seesaw Simpson. When, having obtained permission, she walked to the water pail in the corner and drank from the dipper, unseen forces dragged Seesaw from his seat to go and drink after her. It was not only that there was something akin to association and intimacy in drinking next, but there was the fearful joy of meeting her in transit and receiving a cold and disdainful look from her wonderful eyes.  On a certain warm day in summer Rebecca's thirst exceeded the bounds of propriety. When she asked a third time for permission to quench it at the common fountain Miss Dearborn nodded \"yes,\" but lifted her eyebrows unpleasantly as Rebecca neared the desk. As she replaced the dipper Seesaw promptly raised his hand, and Miss Dearborn indicated a weary affirmative.  \"What is the matter with you, Rebecca?\" she asked.  \"I had salt mackerel for breakfast,\" answered Rebecca.  There seemed nothing humorous about this reply, which was merely the statement of a fact, but an irrepressible titter ran through the school. Miss Dearborn did not enjoy jokes neither made nor understood by herself, and her face flushed.  \"I think you had better stand by the pail for five minutes, Rebecca; it may help you to control your thirst.\"  Rebecca's heart fluttered. She to stand in the corner by the water pail and be stared at by all the scholars! She unconsciously made a gesture of angry dissent and moved a step nearer her seat, but was arrested by Miss Dearborn's command in a still firmer voice.  \"Stand by the pail, Rebecca! Samuel, how many times have you asked for water to-day?\"  \"This is the f-f-fourth.\"  \"Don't touch the dipper, please. The school has done"]]]
