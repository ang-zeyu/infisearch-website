And so, we've only been able to watch and wait ... and hope. And to date we're no better off than we were two years ago.\"  \"Serrangi and his Devil's Den is the leak, sir?\" murmured Freddy Farmer as the senior officer paused for breath.  \"We don't know,\" was the blunt reply. \"You see, this business is so confoundedly twisted up that anything might be possible. It might even be possible that Serrangi is loyal to the Crown, though I'm sure I would drop dead from the shock if such proof even came to my attention. But I'm only telling you what we suspect, not what we know. And the first item on our long list of suspicions is that all Axis spies entering or leaving Singapore do so through the Devil's Den. In short that Serrangi's place is ... you might say ... the clearing house for information. A couple of months ago a known Nazi spy ... one high up in the Gestapo by the way ... was picked up as he left the Devil's Den. We found nothing of interest on his person, however. And we could not prove that he had gone to Serrangi's for any other reason than to make a few purchases. Also, not over two weeks ago one of our agents was last seen entering Serrangi's. We never saw him again. We haven't even found his body yet. And an authorized search of the Devil's Den brought to light absolutely nothing!\"  The Air Vice Marshal paused and clenched both fists in a helpless gesture.  \"Working in the East is so utterly different from working in the West!\" he said bitterly. \"In England we could close up a place like the Devil's Den, and burn it to the ground, if we thought it was necessary. And toss the lot of them in prison, to boot. But you can't do that sort of thing out here. Not unless you want to have native trouble on your hands. Anyway, we feel certain that if we could learn even a few of the secrets of Serrangi's place we would be able to profit as much as though we had an extra dozen divisions of trained troops, together with aircraft, and the like. Now, here is the part that concerns you. And....\"  The Intelligence Officer stopped talking abruptly and stared hard at the two youths.  \"This is entirely outside your line of duty,\" he said almost harshly. \"Just because I am telling you all this does not mean in the slightest that you must agree to go through with the thing. You two are R.A.F. pilots, and there's still plenty for you to do as such. I mean.... Well, that is....\"  \"Why not just tell us, sir?\" Dave interrupted with an encouraging grin as the senior officer fumbled for words. \"If we get cold feet, or think we'd flop the thing, we promise to tell you.\"  \"Thanks, Dawson,\" the Air Vice Marshal said gravely. \"Very well, then. I want to get you two into Serrangi's place, by hook or by crook. No one knows you have come to Singapore. I mean, the Harkness has arrived but you weren't aboard. Of course, by now those damn Axis agents, that have been virtually living in my pockets without my knowing it, must know that two pilots took off from the Harkness before she reached port; that their arrival at Singapore is long over-due, and that this Catalina has gone out to try and find them. Well, this Catalina is going to return to Singapore R.A.F. Base, her flight a failure. Yes, we found the half submerged wreckage of the Harkness' plane. But, _no_ sign of the two who were in it. Examination of the wreckage showed that the craft had obviously been shot down. How, we don't know. We are only certain that the two pilots in her are dead. The sharks must have got them.\"  Dave Dawson licked his lower lip and glanced sidewise at Freddy Farmer.  \"Imagine how the shark that got you feels!\" he chuckled.  \"Is that so!\" the English youth snapped. \"Well, it's always been difficult to tell from the look on your face whether you were dead or alive. So you fit the part perfectly, my lad.\"  \"Ouch!\" Dave cried and winced. Then grinning at the Intelligence officer he said, \"Go ahead, sir. Don't mind us. It's the way we let off steam, I guess.\"  \"More should adopt the method,\" the Air Vice Marshal said firmly. \"But this business is far from a joke. It is far more serious than I can tell you. To be very brutal about it, by this time tomorrow it's quite possible that you and Farmer _may be_....\"  The senior officer didn't finish. Instead he stuck out a clenched fist and then extended the thumb downward toward the compartment floor. The gesture was more explanatory than words. Dave felt a tingling chill ripple through his heart but he kept the grin on his face. After a moment the Air Intelligence officer continued.  \"You two will be reported as definitely dead,\" he said. \"I'll make no bones about being certain of that. I fancy we'll even drink a silent toast to you at evening mess. You know, do the thing up right for the benefit of listening ears or watching eyes. Meantime, you two will proceed to Bukum Street and go into the Devil's Den. Both of you speak German, and French, and, of course, English. You will have to decide for yourselves what language you want to use. You'll be.... Well, you'll be wharf rats to all appearances. Or you can be a couple of French merchant sailors stranded in Singapore after jumping ship. You can be a couple of Germans rescued from a China boat sunk off shore. Fact is, you can be anything you like. It will be frankly up to you to decide each move as you go along.\"  \"Aren't you just a bit ahead of things, sir?\" Freddy Farmer said as the flush mounted in his cheeks. \"I mean, how do we get ashore from this Catalina? And what about clothes?\"  \"That's the easiest part of the whole thing,\" the other replied. \"We'll talk about that later. Now, the moment you enter the Devil's Den your lives will be in your own hands. I cannot tell you what you will find. I cannot tell you what will happen. I'd be a blasted miracle maker, if I could. But, I can tell you this. We know the identification code word of Nazi agents out here in the Far East. It's three words, as a matter of fact. _Der Fuehrer's Tag._ Meaning, of course, The Leader's Day. How and when you use it, I do not know. And....\"  The Air Vice Marshal paused and groaned softly.  \"And I have got to tell you this,\" he said presently. \"The British Intelligence agent who entered the Devil's Den two weeks ago, never to be seen again, was _also_ armed with the code word, or words. I am as certain, though, as I am that I'm sitting here, that the Nazi agent identification signal has not been changed. They still use it, and you two will have to decide the proper time, and place, to mention it.\"  \"A salute when you take a sip of your coffee might be a good idea,\" Dave said, looking at Freddy. \"Sort of say it under your breath, but loud enough for anyone sitting close to hear.\"  Dave turned his head and looked at Air Vice Marshal Bostworth.  \"Your plan is for us to be a couple of Axis agents reporting, isn't it, Sir?\" he asked.  The Air Intelligence officer gave Dawson a look of frank admiration, and nodded instantly.  \"Exactly that,\" he said. \"I'm sure new agents sent out go straight to Serrangi's place. Of course, there may be some one to whom they report. I don't know. That's the risk you've got to take. But here's a plan to cover that part. You can be a couple of Axis agents shipping from China to ... say Australia. Your boat was sunk.... I can give you the names of several ships sunk in the South China Sea recently ... and you were put ashore in Singapore. You, of course, have known of the Devil's Den, and you know the code words for identification.\"  \"That's a splendid arrangement, sir!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up excitedly. \"That way we won't have to show any papers. We can say we lost everything at sea. But....\"  The English youth stopped short and scowled.  \"But what, Farmer?\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth prompted.  It was a few seconds before Freddy acted as though he had heard.  \"I was thinking, sir,\" he said slowly, \"what if nobody pays any attention to us? What if we just go into this Devil's Den, and nothing happens?\"  \"We've got to hope hard that something will,\" the Air Intelligence officer said grimly. \"And I don't think you need worry about nobody paying any attention to you. You'll be strangers, and you'll look the part of seamen put ashore from a lost ship. I'm quite certain that Serrangi keeps a very close watch on everybody who comes into his place. However, that's the blasted sticker about this thing. It's no more and no less than a blind stab in the dark. It may gain us nothing, and then again, it may gain us a lot. And ... it may get you both a knife in your back before you've been in the place five minutes. I pray to God not, but that's the chance you'll be taking. To sum it up bluntly, you'll simply be grabbing at possible straws, and....\"  \"And there may not be any to grab,\" Dave grunted as the other hesitated.  \"Precisely!\" the senior officer said and made a wry face. \"You'll be taking a wild, blind shot in the dark to connect with something that will lead you to the top rankers in the Axis espionage system working in Singapore.\"  \"It would certainly be a break if the spy you're gunning for at Singapore R.A.F. Base uses Serrangi's as a contact place,\" Dave said. \"I think I could spot an R.A.F. lad with my eyes shut.\"  \"Not this one, I fancy,\" the Air Vice Marshal said. \"He may be R.A.F. on the surface when he's on duty, but the blighter is Nazi at heart. He'll be clever, and twice as cruel, too. But, if you should be lucky enough to contact him ... rather, spot him ... a lot of my worries would be over. Once I find out that beggar's identity I've got a very neat little plan already to be put into operation. That, however, would be like asking for a miracle on a silver platter.\"  \"But, supposing we do tag him,\" Dave persisted. \"How do you plan for us to get word to you, sir?\"  \"I've arranged for that,\" the senior officer said. \"In front of the Raffles Hotel, which is perhaps the easiest thing to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],["title","Dave Dawson at Singapore (#8)"],["body","in all Singapore, there's always a gathering of peddlers and hawkers who will sell anything to soldiers and civilians alike. In peace times they made quite a good thing out of it from the tourist trade, but they are not doing so well now that half the world is at war. However they still cluster about in front of the Raffles hoping to make a few pennies. Anyway, one of them is a horrible looking creature. He is not more than five feet tall, and bent over at that. He wears a dirty white patch over his right eye, and the thumb on the left hand is missing. He is always there, and you couldn't possibly miss him. Put any message you have for me in Air Intelligence Code Six-X-Seven, walk past the man with the patch over his right eye, and toss the wadded message into the gutter, as though it were a bit of paper you were throwing away. And.... By the by, you know the Air Intelligence Code Six-X-Seven, of course?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Freddy spoke for both of them. \"By heart, sir.\"  \"Good,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said and gave them a pleased nod. \"Well, do as I say, if you have any message you want transmitted to me. However, be sure and just walk by the beggar, and toss the bit of paper into the gutter. Do not turn to him or look at him. And for heaven's sake don't speak to him. You'll probably lose the man his life if you speak to him. And I hasten to tell you that he is one of the best British counter espionage agents in Singapore. Well, so much for that. Now, any other questions?\"  Dave looked at Freddy Farmer and nodded.  \"Go ahead with that question you asked awhile back,\" he said. \"I guess that's the important one, now.\"  The English youth looked blank for a moment, then his face brightened as he realized what Dave was talking about.  \"Oh, yes, quite,\" he said and turned to Air Vice Marshal Bostworth. \"It's that question I asked about getting ashore from this Catalina, and clothes, sir.\"  \"Simple, quite simple,\" the senior officer replied with a faint wave of his hand. \"I only hope the rest of this blasted business will be equally as simple. Well....\"  The man paused, looked at his watch, and then glanced out the porthole at the blood red sun that was balancing like a ball on the western horizon line. Its flaming red rays fanned out across the sky to bathe everything in a pinkish glow. Even the wings of the Catalina were touched by the glow that bounced off their glossy surfaces and seeped in through the ports to the interior of the compartment. The dying sun was a beautiful, breath catching sight ... but not right at the moment for Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer. Their thoughts were not on beautiful things, now, but on many other things, not the least of which was possible death by tomorrow's setting sun.  \"Well, in an hour it will be darkish, sort of,\" the Air Vice Marshal continued speaking. \"When it is we're going to head back toward Singapore. I will have the radio operator send word that our search failed, and that I'm having this flyingboat land in Keppel Harbor as I wish to go direct to the Government buildings in the city. We will land in the harbor and the crew will break out two of the collapsible boats we carry aboard. I will go ashore in one. You two will use the other. Under cover of darkness you can easily reach some section of Singapore's waterfront undetected. Simply go ashore and release the air valve in your boat. It will fill up and sink at once. As for clothes....\"  The senior officer paused and smiled faintly.  \"This is not the first time I have used this Catalina for Intelligence work,\" he said. \"In fact, it is used almost exclusively for such jobs. You'd be surprised the stuff we have aboard this craft. We carry all kinds of clothes, from a German soldier's uniform on up to almost anything you could mention. Don't worry, before you leave this Catalina you'll look so much like a couple of rescued sailors from a China to Australia boat your own families wouldn't recognize you. Later I'll give you facts of an actual sinking to make your story ring true. Now, what else, eh?\"  Dave started to speak, but thought better of it after an instant's hesitation, and closed his mouth. Air Vice Marshal Bostworth gave him a sharp quizzical glance.  \"Yes, Dawson?\" he encouraged. \"What is it? Ask anything you like. After all, this is not going to be any tea party that you two are setting out on. If you've got something to ask me, go right ahead. Later on, you might regret not having asked it.\"  Dave hesitated a couple of more seconds, then shrugged.  \"Well, maybe it's a crazy question, sir,\" he said slowly, \"but somehow I always like to be on the safe side. I mean, I like to be sure about a couple of things in advance, when I stick my neck out, if you get what I mean?\"  \"I think I understand, a little,\" the other said. \"But perhaps you'd better make yourself a bit clearer, eh?\"  The American born R.A.F. ace took a deep breath as though he were about to dive off into icy waters. Then he blurted it out.  \"The crew of this Catalina, sir,\" he said. \"You admit that there is some Nazi agent at the Singapore R.A.F. Base. A lad you haven't been able to lay by the heels yet. Well, what I mean is this. Those aboard this flyingboat know who we are. The sergeant gunner asked us if we were Dawson and Farmer when we came aboard. Well.... That is to say.... I mean....\"  Dave stumbled to a halt and flushed a deep red.  \"You mean, how about the loyalty of the crew of this Catalina?\" the Air Vice Marshal helped him out.  \"Yes, sir,\" Dave said with a nod.  \"A perfectly fair question,\" the other replied. \"I'll describe their loyalty in this way, then. _I_ would reveal your true identity to the Nazi agents in Singapore before any one of them would.\"  \"That's all I want to know,\" Dave said. \"Fair enough. Any better wouldn't do. How about you, Freddy?\"  \"Quite,\" the English youth said. \"Oh, very definitely and absolutely!\"  \"Then what are we waiting for?\" Dave said, turning back to Air Vice Marshal Bostworth with a grin. \"Let's get going and not keep old Serrangi waiting any longer than we have to!\"     CHAPTER SEVEN  _The Jaws Of Death_   Night had come again to Singapore. From one end of the Island to the other all was cloaked in velvety darkness save where light made by man thrust aside the shadows. At Raffles Hotel they still danced, and at the famous city cafes they still drank and watched worn out floor shows, even though the nearness of war in the Far East seemed to hang in the very air like a shroud. Even in the poorer sections, and in the slums, there were sounds of merry-making. It was almost as though rich man and beggar alike were enjoying themselves as much as they could before the sword of Mars came slashing down on that section of the earth.  In the unspeakably smelly alley that is known as Bukum Street two figures slouched along as though they didn't have an idea in the world where they were going, and cared even less when they got there. At every little opened front shop they paused and gaped vacant eyed at the collection of wares on display. Sometimes they muttered things to each other in low tones. Sometimes they said nothing, and just stared. And more times than not the storekeepers instantly sized them up as very poor prospects for a sale and waved them on their way.  Presently they both halted in their tracks as though by unspoken signal and stared half a block ahead at a two story wooden building on the other side of the street. It was much the same as all the others save there was no shop on the lower floor of this building, and therefore it had no open front. On the contrary, it had a front door and windows, and hanging from a bracket that protruded from the door was a sign with somebody's idea of His Satanic Majesty painted on it in red.  \"That's us, Freddy!\" muttered the taller of the pair. \"A crummy looking joint, isn't it?\"  \"Much worse!\" came the half muffled reply. \"And good Lord, this awful smell does come from there! So blasted thick and heavy, I can almost see it coming out the front door.\"  \"Yeah,\" Dave Dawson murmured. \"And if it's from the brand of coffee they serve in there I'm afraid I'm going to be an awful flop before I even get started. I couldn't keep anything down that smells like that for longer than one millionth of one split second. Holy catfish! Do you suppose this Serrangi runs a slaughter house on the side? Boy! That stench almost bounces when it hits you.\"  \"That's right,\" Freddy Farmer agreed. \"We should have remembered to bring clothespins. Well, worse luck for us, we didn't. But what do you say, Dave? Shall we get on with it?\"  \"Why not, we've come this far,\" Dave grunted, and started slouching forward again. \"But, look, Freddy.\"  \"At what?\"  \"No, I mean, listen!\" Dave hissed out the corner of his mouth. \"Bostworth handed us a pip this time. Like trying to win a ball game in the last of the ninth with your team a couple of hundred runs behind. What I mean is, that anything can happen from here on. Just like Bostworth said, when we go through that door we're on our own. We may strike out on three pitched balls, and then again we may run into something mighty valuable to him. But there's two guys we've got to look out for all the time. You and me. Now, if by any chance things do get rough, keep close to me. We make it or don't, together. Okay?\"  \"Absolutely,\" Freddy Farmer replied quietly. \"Shoulder to shoulder all the time, Dave, of course.\"  \"Maybe in Serrangi's place we'd better make it back to back,\" Dave said. \"They're experts with knives in this part of the world, so I've been told. So if we get back to back when things break bad, we'll at least see who's doing what.\"  \"I'd feel happier if we were armed,\" Freddy Farmer said. \"I suppose Bostworth was right when he said that carrying arms might get us into trouble if we were searched. Just the same, though, I'd feel a lot happier if we were armed.\"  \"You and me each, brother!\" Dave breathed softly as they neared the front "]]]
