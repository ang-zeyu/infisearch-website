Now what have you to say to that?\" I said. She looked me fair in the face and said, \"You can afford to build on anything that Emma Smith has to say.\" \"Thank you,\" said I.  It is true that she told me she was married to Joseph Smith May 1, 1843; but when I showed her that the so-called revelation permitting a plurality of wives was dated July 12, 1843, and referred to her former testimony as given in the _Historical Record_, and that given under oath in the Temple Lot suit, she was confounded. I felt sorry for the old lady as she sat silent and confounded.  It is true that I saw a very old lady in your father's parlor, as she came slowly in for prayers. Your father said, \"This is Catherine Phillips Smith. She was married to my father, Hyrum Smith, and she has never married since. I am not sure that the old lady heard a word. It is certain that _she did not testify to me_, but it was your father who made the statement, and at once called us to prayer, thus preventing me from speaking to the old lady.  Lorenzo Snow did testify to me, as stated; but then and there, in the presence of Joseph F. Smith and George Q. Cannon, I showed _his testimony to be false, by his own evidence_, when given _under oath_, and _by his sister's statement signed in 1842_. At this, Snow, Cannon and Smith were all much annoyed. So much for your father's statement, which says \"you did not say one word to him in relation to polygamy.\"   YOUR FATHER'S FIRST WIFE  You seem to feel sore over the statement that your father's \"first wife died broken hearted and insane\"; and you add, \"If you mean to insinuate that this condition, if true, was the result of any act whatever on the part of my father, it is also slanderously false.\" I insinuate nothing; let the public judge the facts. Your father's first wife was his cousin; she refused to consent to additional wives, and when he persisted in marrying the Lambson sisters, she obtained a divorce in California. Julina and Edna Lambson were sisters and were married to Joseph F. Smith on the same day.[8]  Number of wives married to Joseph F. Smith since 1865: 6  Number of children born to him in 38 years: 42  Number of children born since plural marriage was prohibited in 1890: 13  Children of Julina Lambson Smith: 2  Children of Sarah Richards Smith: 2  Children of Edna Lambson Smith: 2  Children of Alice Kimball Smith: 3  Children of Mary Schwartz Smith: 4  Estimated income available for supporting five establishments: $75,000  Corporations, banks and factories of which Joseph F. Smith is a director: 20  The only Mormon Apostle who surpasses the record of President Smith is M. W. Merrill, with 8 wives, 45 children, and 156 grandchildren.--_Collier's_ for March 26, 1894 [1904].  * * * * *  While in Utah I was informed that your father's first wife died broken hearted and insane. God and civilization know that a woman who loved her husband from youth up has enough to break her heart and send her insane when her husband will marry two other women, both sisters, in one day.  Perhaps you will be assisted to view the matter as I do, should you read the following in the Book of Mormon, Jacob 2:6, 7. Here it is stated, in consequence of polygamy, \"ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives.\" Does this make the prophet an asperser or a scandalmonger?  I have answered your letter as it appeared in the Toronto _Star_ as fully as space would permit.                                                 Respectfully,                                                        R. C. Evans.  Toronto, Ontario, March 1, 1905.[9]   Footnotes  1. The teachings of the Latter-day Saints in relation to the doctrine of the Godhead are clearly set forth in Elder B. H. Roberts' valuable work, \"Mormon Doctrine of Deity.\" For the belief of the \"Mormon\" people regarding Adam and his place in the universe, attention is called especially to chapters one, five and six of that work; also to Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 78:15-18, sec. 107:53-57 and Daniel 7:9-14. In relation to this matter I quote the following from the remarks of President Anthon H. Lund delivered at the General Conference, October 6, 1902.  \"Some there are who follow our Elders, and after they have preached the principles of salvation, these men get up and charge that the Elders do not believe in God, but that they believe in Adam as their God, and they will bring up a few passages from sermons delivered by this or that man in the Church to substantiate this charge. Now, we are not ashamed of the glorious doctrine of eternal progression, that man may attain the position of those to whom came the word of God, that is gods. When Jesus was preaching unto the Jews on one occasion they stoned Him, and He wanted to know if they stoned Him for the good works He had been doing. Oh, no, they say, 'for the good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.'\"  He quoted the 33rd to 37th verses of the 10th chapter of the Gospel of St. John, and said:  \"We believe that there are gods as the Savior quoted. He repeated what was written in the law, and he did not say that it was wrong, but used it as an argument against them (The Jews.) While, however, we believe as the scripture states, that there are more gods, to us there is but one God. We worship the God that created the heavens and the earth. We worship the same God that came to our first parents in the Garden of Eden. In the revelation contained in section 116 of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants the Lord speaks concerning Adam-ondi-Ahman, 'the place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the ancient of days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the Prophet.' In the 107th section the Lord speaks of Adam as Michael, the Prince, the Archangel, and says that he shall be a prince over the nations forever. We may with perfect propriety call him Prince, the Ancient of Days, or even God in the meaning of the words of Christ, which I have just quoted. When our missionaries are met with these sophistries and with isolated extracts from sermons we say to them anything that is a tenet of our religion must come through revelation and be sustained by the Church, and they need not do battle for anything outside of the works, that have been accepted by the Church as a body.\"  2. If popular custom had designated the true believers of the Bible as \"Bibles\" as a term of distinction from other worshippers, there is no reason why a true believer should be offended even at that appellation but rather honored. Mr. Evans, without doubt, is not ashamed of the name \"Christian,\" yet this term, like that of \"Mormon\" was first applied to the followers of Christ in derision, \"because it was associated in the public mind with the practices\" of the early Saints, which practices in that day were looked on as \"abominations.\"  3. This is a misquotation, it should be: \"I could refer you to plenty of instances where men have been righteously slain, in order to atone for their sins. I have seen scores and hundreds of people for whom there would have been a chance (in the last resurrection there will be) if their lives had been taken and their blood spilled on the ground as a smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now angels to the devil, until our elder brother Jesus Christ raises them up--conquers death, hell and the grave.\"  In that same discourse President Young declares that those who were \"righteously slain\" were the wicked that the \"Lord had to slay\" in ancient Israel. There is not one word in that discourse to indicate that those who were slain to \"atone for their sins\" were killed in Utah; but to the contrary they were ancient inhabitants of the earth, viz., the antediluvians who perished in the flood, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Jericho and the cities destroyed by the Israelites; the prophets of Baal whom Elijah slew (I Kings 18:40) and a host of others of that class and the class to whom the one belonged of whom the Savior said: \"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\" President Young's remarks agree with those of Peter when he declared that the Jews who were guilty of assenting to the crucifixion of Christ could not be baptized nor have their \"sins blotted out\" until the \"times of refreshing shall come,\" which was at the time of the \"restitution of all things.\"--Acts 3:19-21.  4. In extreme haste here to make a point, Mr. Evans left in the middle of a sentence and hurried on to the next page to complete the expression he desired to convey. This is what President Cannon said: \"A prevalent idea has been that this prejudice against us owes its origin and continuation to our belief in a plurality of wives; but when it is recollected that the mobbings, drivings, and expulsions from cities, counties and states which we have endured, and our exodus to these mountains all took place before the revelation of that doctrine was PUBLICLY known, it will be seen at once that our belief in it has not been the cause of persecution.\" Now, I ask, is it not plain to see why his quotation stopped in the middle of a sentence? The Saints all know that President George Q. Cannon was always faithful to his testimony that plural marriage was introduced by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Latter-day Saints generally declare that this doctrine was not _publicly_ known in the days of Joseph the Seer, but that it was taught by him to his trusted friends. When this fact is known the alleged quotations which follow, purported to be from H. B. Clawson, Ephraim Jensen and \"Elder Whitaker\" lose their force.  5. This is not in the Salt Lake Herald of February 9, 1852.  6. The following is the Brooklyn _Citizen's_ report of that same discourse from which Mr. Evans quotes his passage as given in the New York _Herald_: Elder Whitaker said: \"The people of the East have been led to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],["title","Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#7)"],["body","that polygamy was alone responsible for all the troubles of the Mormons, but the fact remains, that as the fight was waged against Jesus Christ, against his followers, and against all great men for declaring the truth, so the same spirit is manifest now; but the Mormons will humbly seek those willing to accept the truths inspired of God, leaving the justice of their cause to be vindicated by honest investigation and time. The fight is directed against the doctrine of the Mormon Church, though polygamy has done such yeoman service in arousing public sentiment, to attain certain ends unworthy of honest men. The crusaders have kept the public mind from the real cause of the attack. From the time the Church was organized in 1830-47, when the people, after many previous drivings, persecutions, mobbings and cruel mockings, were driven to Utah, the cry of polygamy was never made a cause of their persecutions; indeed, that subject was not committed in writing until 1843, never published to the world until 1852, and was abandoned by the issuance of the 'Manifesto' of President Wilford Woodruff, in 1890, since which time not one polygamous marriage has been solemnized; but those having wives at that time were never asked, and it was never expected they would abandon them, and when death brings such relations to a close, there will be no polygamy among the Mormons.\" The Brooklyn _Citizen_, Monday, January 8, 1900.  Why Mr. Evans accepted the brief extract from the New York _Herald_ in preference to the full account in the Brooklyn _Citizen_ will require no comment, but it certainly does appear that Elder Whitaker _did_ know who introduced \"polygamy.\"  As I do not have the Yeoman's _Shield_ and am not in communication with Elder Ephraim Jenson, I cannot vouch for his remarks, but feel safe in saying that if the whole report were published, his testimony would agree with that of Elder Whitaker as published in the Brooklyn _Citizen_.  7. In quoting from \"The Mysteries of Mormonism, by an Apostle's Wife,\" Mr. Evans reveals the character of his \"dozens and dozens of witnesses.\" The reader will perceive that he depends largely on the most bitter anti-\"Mormons\" and apostates for his \"evidence,\" but in quoting from \"The Mysteries of Mormonism, by an Apostle's Wife,\" he certainly reaches the climax of this base testimony. This work was published in 1882, by Richard K. Fox, proprietor of the notorious _Police Gazette_. The author of these \"Mysteries,\" undoubtedly a man, assumes the title of \"An Apostle's Wife,\" in order to hide his perfidy. The work is one of the vilest and most contemptible of all anti-\"Mormon\" publications, and is most bitter in its denunciation of the Prophet Joseph Smith. In it he is called a \"lusty toper,\" \"the worst of a bad breed,\" \"an ignorant, brutal loafer,\" \"immoral, false and fraudulent,\" and the author says, \"_this_ is the man who founded what he dared to call a faith, and grafted on the United States the religion of licentiousness and bodily lust known as Mormonism.\" An apology is perhaps due for even referring to this matter, but since Mr. Evans makes this work one of the chief of his \"dozens and dozens of witnesses,\" I feel that he should be exposed. He professes to believe in the divine mission of Joseph Smith, and yet calls upon us to accept the wicked falsehoods of this disreputable witness, whom he declares \"_ought to know whereof she affirms_.\" Shame upon the man who draws his inspiration from such a source!  8. This whole statement is absolutely false, and there was not the least shadow of reason for uttering it. President Smith's first wife did not refuse to consent to additional wives. He did not marry two sisters on the same day. In depending on the unreliable Alfred Henry Lewis for his argument, Mr. Evans shows the desperate weakness of his position. It would be a hard matter to squeeze more falsehoods in the space occupied by the article of A. H. Lewis, from which Mr. Evans quotes so faithfully.  9. This letter is dated March 1, 1905, but was not written until sometime after April 19, 1905, for on the latter date Mr. Evans wrote: \"You may look for reply to your letter as it appeared in the Toronto _Star_, as soon as I have time to reply thereto.\" This reply was received May 5, 1905.    A REJOINDER TO MR. R. C. EVANS' LETTER                                             Salt Lake City, May 23, 1905.  _Mr. R. C. Evans_,  _Counselor in Presidency of Reorganized Church_.  Sir:--Your reply to my open letter of February 17 was received May 5. Whether I was \"fair, dispassionate and also candid\" in my letter, or, as you seem to think, \"guilty of a labored effort to cover up the true facts regarding 'blood atonement, polygamy, etc.'\" and \"your faith\"--which was not discussed--I am perfectly willing to leave to the judgment of \"those who read\" the same in the Toronto _Star_. So on this point we may both rest satisfied.   BLOOD ATONEMENT  I will now consider your \"labored effort to cover up the _true facts_ regarding blood atonement.\"  In my letter I candidly placed the true belief and teachings of the Latter-day Saints in relation to this doctrine before you. This fact appears to be displeasing to you, as it overturns your conclusions and accusations against our people. If you desire to know the correct position of the Church on this doctrine, I would recommend a careful study of John Taylor's _Meditation and Atonement_ and Charles W. Penrose's _Blood Atonement_, which was published in answer to such wicked misrepresentations as I claim you have made in relation to this principle and our belief in relation thereto. There is no reason for any person to misunderstand our position, unless he desires to do so. I claim, too, that we are in a better position to teach that which we believe than is the stranger who attempts to present our case, especially if he is antagonistic or unfriendly.  If you do not believe the doctrine of blood atonement as that doctrine is taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which church you are pleased to call \"Utah Mormonism,\" then I say that you _do not_ believe in the atonement of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To this I will refer later.  You delight--as all anti-\"Mormons\" do--in referring to statements made by President Brigham Young, Jedediah M. Grant and others during the troublous times preceding the advent of Johnston's army into Utah. I see, too, that like many others, you place your own _desired_ interpretation on their remarks, place them before the public in a garbled state, taking care to give the darkest interpretation possible from which the public may gather false conclusions. You take great pains to cover up the conditions prevailing which called forth such extreme and in some instances unwise remarks. Conditions in some respects akin to those surrounding the Saints in Missouri in 1838-39 when other unwise remarks were made by members of the leading quorums of the Church, but in a sense justifiable and which should be condoned under the trying circumstances that called them forth.[1]   THE CHURCH JUDGED FROM ITS ACCEPTED STANDARDS  Writing on this subject Elder B. H. Roberts, in his criticism on Harry Leon Wilson's plagarisms in his _Lions of the Lord_, declares the position taken by members of the Church and all fair-minded men in these words:      \"The justice of Burke's assertion has never been questioned, and     without any wresting whatever it may be applied to \"Mormon\" leaders     who sometimes spoke and acted under the recollection of rank     injustice perpetrated against themselves and their people; or to     rebuke rising evils against which their souls revolted.\"  Even the president of the Reorganized Church recognized this fact in his answer to _The American Baptist_, wherein he said:      \"Whoever counseled or did evil in those times (in Missouri) are     responsible, personally, therefor; but the church, as such is no     more responsible for it than were the early Christians for Peter's     attempt to kill the high priest's servant when he cut off his     ear with his sword. The church, as such, should be judged by its     authorized doctrines and deeds, and not by the unauthorized sayings     or doings of some or many of its members or ministers.      It is not to be wondered at that in those times when the embryo     authors and abettors of the \"Border Ruffianism\" that reigned in     Missouri and Kansas from 1854 to 1865 had matters all their own     way, that some of the Saints, vexed, confused and excited, should     have done many things unwisely and wrongfully, and contrary to the     law of God.\"--_Saints' Herald_, 37:51.  With this I heartily agree.  Now, when the statements were made, which you in a garbled manner both quote and misquote, there was in Utah a class of individuals who spent the greater part of their time in circulating wicked and malicious reports about the Saints, threatening their lives, committing crimes and attempting to make the Saints their scape-goats. The officers of the law were General Government officials appointed by the President of the United States, and I am sorry to say, some of these were among the chief villifiers of the people. The most damnable and bloodthirsty falsehoods were concocted and served up to the people of the United States to stir them up to anger against the \"despised Mormons.\" Almost every crime that was committed within a thousand miles of Salt Lake City was charged to the leaders of the \"Mormon\" people and became the foundation of a multitude of anti-\"Mormon\" publications that still flood the world. Because of these false and highly colored tales, in 1857--one year later than the time that most of the utterances were given on which you so delight to dwell--the Government of the United States sent an army to suppress in Utah a rebellion that never existed, and forced the Saints to defend themselves. When the Government found out how it had blundered it"]]]
