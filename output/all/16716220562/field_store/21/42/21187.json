And they are all of equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to all. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all space and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes, in each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.  64.  The body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids produced by the objects existing in it. These intersect and cross each other with independent convergence without interfering with each other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are of equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And by means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and on all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of the object that produces it.  Proof by experiment (65-66).  65.  PERSPECTIVE.  The air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in it; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each, whence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as to face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the second and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the second takes to it the image of itself with all the images represented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror, and so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner as that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the last and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly proved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the object itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object may receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in front of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own image to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them into itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in by the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing commits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the invisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the image of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must be disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several mirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly. When one has reached the other it is returned to the object that produced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to the object and then comes back once more, and this happens endlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a distance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an infinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If at night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts of that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they will receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually, that is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the transmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater degree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and each by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which causes it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the atmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same time, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are in it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is everywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in every smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all in each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.  66.  The images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which receives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c e_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by the small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to these holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the plane as the number of the said holes.  67.  General conclusions.  All objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and mingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The image of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of the atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of the atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the atmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies presented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images of the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the surface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that the image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in each part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body. As is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.  68.  That the contrary is impossible.  It is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual rays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front portion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would have to go forth to the object and this it could not do without time. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a month's time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach the sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually remain in a continuous line from the eye to the sun and should always diverge in such a way as to form between the sun and the eye the base and the apex of a pyramid. This being the case, if the eye consisted of a million worlds, it would not prevent its being consumed in the projection of its virtue; and if this virtue would have to travel through the air as perfumes do, the winds would bent it and carry it into another place. But we do [in fact] see the mass of the sun with the same rapidity as [an object] at the distance of a braccio, and the power of sight is not disturbed by the blowing of the winds nor by any other accident.  [Footnote: The view here refuted by Leonardo was maintained among others by Bramantino, Leonardo's Milanese contemporary. LOMAZZO writes as follows in his Trattato dell' Arte della pittura &c. (Milano 1584. Libr. V cp. XXI): Sovviemmi di aver giŕ letto in certi scritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore, attenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi intessere in questo luogo, affinchč sappiamo qual fosse l'opinione di cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive Bramantino che la prospettiva č una cosa che contrafŕ il naturale, e che ciň si fa in tre modi  Circa il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in poche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non potersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al fine, io riferirň per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima prospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di punto, e l'altra non mai, e la terza piů appresso. Adunque la prima si dimanda prospettiva, cioč ragione, la quale fa l'effetto dell' occhio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi. Questo crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se per esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non puň crescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali sono piccioli, e perciň volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che mandino fuora la virtů visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta larghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a quella cosa la vede dove č: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito fino all' occhio, e tutto quello termine č pieno di quella cosa_.  It is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting this view, at Milan in 1492]  69.  A parallel case.  Just as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of many circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so any object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in circles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of itself. And is repeated, the whole every-where, and the whole in every smallest part. This can be proved by experiment, since if you shut a window that faces west and make a hole [Footnote: 6. Here the text breaks off.] . .  [Footnote: Compare LIBRI, _Histoire des sciences mathématiques en Italie_. Tome III, p. 43.]  The function of the eye as explained by the camera obscura (70. 71).  70.  If the object in front of the eye sends its image to the eye, the eye, on the other hand, sends its image to the object, and no portion whatever of the object is lost in the images it throws off, for any reason either in the eye or the object. Therefore we may rather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous atmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it, than the nature of the objects, to send their images through the air. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the eye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it might seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would be necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller; because each object appears by its images in the surrounding atmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and in each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of them in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to contain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images projected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that it is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the objects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a loadstone, being placed between them.  PROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE AND ALL IN EACH PART.

Winfield, 1915  (Edward Stratemeyer)     INTRODUCTION  My Dear Boys: This book is a complete story in itself, but forms the nineteenth volume in a line issued under the general title of \"The Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"  As I have mentioned in several other volumes, this series was started a number of years ago with the publication of \"The Rover Boys at School,\" \"On the Ocean,\" and \"In the Jungle.\" I am happy to say the books were so well liked that they were followed, year after year, by the publication of \"The Rover Boys Out West,\" \"On the Great Lakes,\" \"In Camp,\" \"On Land and Sea,\" \"On the River,\" \"On the Plains,\" \"In Southern Waters,\" \"On the Farm,\" \"On Treasure Isle,\" \"At College,\" \"Down East,\" \"In the Air,\" \"In New York,\" and finally \"In Alaska,\" where we last met the lads.  During all these adventures the Rover boys have been growing older. Dick is now married and conducting his father's business in New York City and elsewhere. 'The fun-loving Tom and his sturdy younger brother, Sam, are at Brill College. The particulars are given of a great baseball game; and then Tom and Sam return home, to be startled by a most unusual message from Dick, calling them to New York immediately. Some bonds of great value have mysteriously disappeared, and unless these are recovered the Rover fortune may be seriously impaired. What the boys did under these circumstances, I will leave the pages which follow to disclose.  Once more thanking my host of young readers for the interest they have taken in my books, I remain,                   Affectionately and sincerely yours,                                                     Arthur M. Winfield.      CHAPTER I  AT THE RIVER   \"Sam!\"  No answer.  \"I say, Sam, can't you listen for just a moment?\"  \"Oh, Tom, please don't bother me now!\" and Sam Rover, with a look of worry on his face, glanced up for a moment from his writing-table. \"I've got to finish this theme before to-morrow morning.\"  \"Oh, I know! But listen!\" And Tom Rover's face showed his earnestness. \"Last night it was full moonlight, and to-night it is going to be equally clear. Why can't we get out the auto and pay a visit to Hope? You know we promised the girls that we would be up some afternoon or evening this week.\"  \"Sounds good, Tom, but even if we went after, supper, could we get there in time? You know all visitors have to leave before nine o'clock.\"  \"We can get there if we start as soon as we finish eating. Can't you finish the theme after we get back? Maybe I can help you.\"  \"Help me? On this theme!\" Sam grinned broadly. \"Tom, you don't know what you are talking about. Do you know what this theme is on?\"  \"No, but I can help you if I have to.\"  \"This is on 'The Theory Concerning the Evolution of----'\"  \"That's enough, Sam; don't give me any of it now. Time enough for that when we have to get at it. There goes the supper bell. Now, downstairs with you! and let us get through as soon as possible and be on our way.\"  \"All right, just as you say!\" and gathering up a number of sheets of paper, Sam thrust them in the drawer of the writing-table.  \"By the way, it's queer we didn't get any letter to-day from Dick,\" the youngest Rover observed.  At the mention of their brother's name, Tom's face clouded a little.  \"It is queer, Sam, and I must say I don't like it. I think this is a case where no news is bad news. I think if everything was going along all right in New York, Dick would surely let us know. I am afraid he is having a good deal of trouble in straightening out Dad's business.\"  \"Just the way I look at it,\" responded Sam, as the brothers prepared to leave the room.  \"One thing is sure, Pelter, Japson & Company certainly did all they could to mix matters up, and I doubt very much if they gave Dad all that was coming to him.\"  \"I believe I made a mistake in coming back to college,\" pursued Tom, as the two boys walked out into the corridor, where they met several other students on the way to the dining hall. \"I think I ought to have given up college and gone to New York City to help Dick straighten out that business tangle. Now that Dad is sick again, the whole responsibility rests on Dick's shoulders, and he ought not to be made to bear it alone.\"  \"Well, if you feel that way, Tom, why don't you break away and go? I think, perhaps, it would be not only a good thing for Dick, but it would, also, be a good thing for you,\" and, for the moment, Sam looked very seriously at his brother.  Tom reddened a bit, and then put his forefinger to his forehead. \"You mean it would help me here?\" And then, as Sam nodded, he added: \"Oh, don't you worry. I am all right now, my head doesn't bother me a bit. But I do wish I could get just one good chance at Pelter for the crack that rascal gave me on the head with the footstool.\"  \"It certainly was a shame to let him off, Tom, but you know how father felt about it. He was too sick to be worried by a trial at law and all that.\"  \"Yes, I know, but just the same, some day I am going to square accounts with Mr. Jesse Pelter,\" and Tom shook his head determinedly.  Passing down the broad stairway of Brill College, the two Rover boys made their way to the dining hall. Here the majority of the students were rapidly assembling for the evening meal, and the lads found themselves among a host of friends.  \"Hello, Songbird! How are you this evening?\" cried Tom, as he addressed a tall, scholarly-looking individual who wore his hair rather long. \"Have you been writing any poetry to-day?\"  \"Well,--er--not exactly, Tom,\" muttered John Powell, otherwise known as Songbird because of his numerous efforts to compose what he called poetry. \"But I have been thinking up a few rhymes.\"  \"When are you going to get out that book of poetry?\"  \"What book is that, Tom?\"  \"Why, as if you didn't know! Didn't you tell me that you were going to get up a volume of 'Original International Poems for the Grave and Gay;' five hundred pages, fully illustrated; and bound in full leather, with title in gold, and...\"  \"Tom, Tom, now please stop your fooling!\" pleaded Songbird, his face flushing. \"Just because I write a poem now and then doesn't say that I am going to publish a book.\"  \"No, but I'm sure you will some day, and you'll make a fortune out of it--or fifteen dollars, anyway.\"  \"The same old Tom!\" cried a merry voice, and another student clapped the fun-loving Rover on the shoulder. \"I do believe you would rather joke than eat!\"  \"Not on your life, Spud! and I'll prove it to you right now!\" and linking his arm through that of Will Jackson, otherwise \"Spud,\" Tom led the way to one of the tables, with Sam and several of the other students following.  \"What is on the docket for to-night?\" asked Songbird, as he fell to eating.  \"Tom and I are going to take a little run in the auto to Hope,\" answered Sam.  \"Oh, I see!\" Songbird Powell shut one eye knowingly. \"Going up there to see the teachers, I suppose!\"  \"Sure, that is what they always do!\" came from Spud, with a wink.  \"Sour grapes, Spud!\" laughed Sam. \"You would go there yourself if you had half a chance.\"  \"Yes, and Songbird would want to go along, too, if we were bound for the Sanderson cottage,\" put in Tom. \"You see, in Songbird's eyes, Minnie Sanderson is just the nicest girl----\"  \"Now stop it, Tom, can't you!\" pleaded poor Songbird, growing decidedly red in the face. \"Miss Sanderson is only a friend of mine, and you know it.\"  Just at that moment the students at the table were interrupted by the approach of a tall, dudish-looking individual, who wore a reddish-brown suit, cut in the most up-to-date fashion, and who sported patent-leather shoes, and a white carnation in his buttonhole. The newcomer took a vacant chair, sitting down with a flourish.  \"I've had a most delightful ramble, don't you know,\" he lisped, looking around at the others. \"I have been through the sylvan woods and by the babbling brook, and have----\"  \"Great Caesar's tombstone!\" exclaimed Tom, looking at the newcomer critically. \"Why, my dearly beloved William Philander, you don't mean to say that you have been delving through the shadowy nooks, and playing with the babbling brook, in that outfit?\"  \"Oh, dear, no, Tom!\" responded William Philander Tubbs. \"I had another suit on, the one with the green stripe, don't you know,--the one I had made last September--or maybe it was in October, I can't really remember. But you must know the suit, don't you?\"  \"Sure! I remember the suit. The green-striped one with the faded-out blue dots and the red diamond check in the corner. Isn't that the same suit you took down to the pawnbroker's last Wednesday night at fifteen minutes past seven and asked him to loan you two dollars and a half on it, and the pawnbroker wanted to know if the suit was your own?\"  \"My dear Tom!\" and William Philander looked aghast. \"You know well enough I never took that suit to a pawnbroker.\"  \"Well, maybe it was some other suit. Possibly the black one with the blue stripes, or maybe it was the blue one with the black stripes. Really, my dearest Philander, it is immaterial to me what suit it was.\" And Tom looked coldly indifferent as he buttered another slice of bread.  \"But I tell you, I never went to any pawn-broker!\" pleaded the dudish student. \"I would not be seen in any such horrid place!\"  \"Oh, pawnbrokers are not so bad,\" came from Spud Jackson, as he helped himself to more potatoes. \"I knew of one fellow down in New Haven who used to loan thousands of dollars to the students at Yale. He was considered a public benefactor. When he died they closed up the college for three days and gave him a funeral over two miles long. And after that, the students raised a fund of sixteen thousand dollars with which to erect a monument to his memory. Now, that is absolutely true, and if you don't believe it you can come to my room and I will show you some dried rose leaves which came from one"]]]
