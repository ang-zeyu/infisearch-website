WANDERER  I will not let thee descend, For a potent magic I wield.     All-wise one,     Planted by thee     The sting of care was In Wotan's dauntless heart;     For, through thy wisdom,     Downfall and shameful     Doom were foretold him; My mind was fettered by fear.     Now let the world's     Wisest of women     Answer and say How a God may conquer his care.  ERBA  Thou art not What thou hast said. Why art thou come, wild and wayward, To trouble the Wala's sleep?  WANDERER      Thou art not     What thou hast dreamed.     Thy end draws near,     Mother of wisdom;     Thy wisdom at war     With me shall perish. Knowest thou Wotan's will?          [_A long silence._      I tell thee     That thou mayest sleep For evermore unvexed by care.     That the Gods are doomed,     No longer dismays me, Since I will it so. What, with myself at war, in anguish, Despairing, once I resolved,     Gaily, gladly, With delight I now do. Mad with disgust I decreed once The world to the Nibelung's hate,     But now to the valiant Wälsung I leave it with joy.     One who never knew me,     Though chosen by me,     A boy bold and fearless,     Helped not by Wotan, Has won the Nibelung's ring.     Blest in love,     Void of all envy,     On him shall fall harmless     Alberich's curse, For no fear does he know.     Soon thy child and mine,     Brünnhild', Shall be waked by him;     And when waked     Our child shall achieve A deed to redeem the world.     So slumber again,     Closing thine eyelids; Dreaming behold my downfall!     Whatever comes after,     The God rejoicing Yields to youth ever young.     Descend, then, Erda,     Mother of fear!     World-sorrow!     Descend! Descend!     And sleep for aye!          [_Erda, whose eyes are already closed, and who has         gradually been sinking deeper, disappears entirely.         The cavern has become quite dark again._      _Dawn lights up the stage; the storm has ceased.     The Wanderer has gone close to the cave, and leans     with his back against it, facing the wings._  WANDERER  Lo! Yonder Siegfried comes.          [_He remains where he is without changing his         position. Siegfried's wood-bird flutters towards         the foreground. Suddenly the bird stops in his         direct flight, flutters to and fro in alarm, and         disappears quickly towards the back._  SIEGFRIED [_Enters and stops._  My bird has vanished from sight!     With fluttering wings     And lovely song Blithely he showed me the way, And then forsook me and fled!     I must discover     The rock for myself: The path I followed so far 'Twere best still to pursue.          [_He goes towards the back._  WANDERER [_Still in the same position._      Boy, pray tell me,     Whither away?  SIEGFRIED [_Halts and turns round._      Did some one speak? Perhaps he knows the road.          [_He goes nearer to the Wanderer._      I would find a rock That by flaming fire is surrounded:     There sleeps a maid     Whom I would awake.  WANDERER      Who bade thee seek     This rock flame-circled?-- Taught thee to yearn for the woman?  SIEGFRIED      It was a singing     Woodland bird; He gave me welcome tidings.  WANDERER  A wood-bird chatters idly What no man understands;     How then couldst thou tell     The song's true meaning?  SIEGFRIED      Because of the blood     Of a dragon grim That fell before me at Neidhöhl'--     The burning blood     Had scarce touched my tongue When the sense of the singer grew plain.  WANDERER      Who was it urged thee on     To try thy strength, And slay this dragon so dread?  SIEGFRIED      My guide was Mime,     A faithless dwarf: What fear is fain he had taught me.     But 'twas the dragon     Roused me himself, Wrathful, to strike the blow; For he threatened me with his jaws.  WANDERER      Who forged the sword     So hard and keen That it slew the daunting foe?  SIEGFRIED      I forged it myself     When the smith was beaten; Swordless else I should have been still.  WANDERER      But who made     The mighty splinters From which the sword was welded strong?  SIEGFRIED      What know I of that?     I only know That the splintered steel was useless Were not the sword forged anew.  WANDERER          [_Bursts out laughing with gleeful good-humour._     I fully agree.  SIEGFRIED [_Surprised._      At what dost thou laugh?     Prying greybeard!     Prithee have done; Keep me no longer here talking.     Speak if thou knowest     Whither my way lies;     And hold thy tongue Unless thou canst tell.  WANDERER      Good boy, have patience!     If I seem old, More need to show me due honour.  SIEGFRIED      What an odd notion!     My whole life long     A hateful old man     Has blocked my pathway; Him I at last swept aside.     Standest thou longer     Trying here to stay me,     I warn thee frankly          [_With a significant gesture._  That thou like Mime shalt fare.          [_He goes still nearer to the Wanderer._      But what art thou like?     Why wearest thou     Such a monstrous hat, And why hangs it so over thy face?  WANDERER [_Still without altering his position._  That is the way I wear it When against the wind I go.  SIEGFRIED [_Inspecting him still more closely._  But an eye beneath it is wanting.     Perchance by some one     Whose way thou didst     Too boldly bar It has been struck out.     Take thyself off,     Or else very soon The other thou shalt lose also!  WANDERER      I see, my son,     Where thou art blind, And hence thy jaunty assurance.     With the eye that is     Amissing in me Thou lookest now on the other That still is left me for sight.  SIEGFRIED          [_Who has been listening thoughtfully, now bursts         involuntarily into hearty laughter._  Thy foolish talk sets me laughing! But come, this nonsense must finish. At once show me my way; Then proceed thou too on thine own;     For me further     Use thou hast none: So speak, or off thou shalt pack!  WANDERER [_Gently._      Child, didst thou know     Who I am, Thy scoffs I had been spared!     From one so dear, Insult hard to endure is.     Long have I loved     Thy radiant race,     Though from my fury     In terror it shrank.     Thou whom I love so,     All too fair one, Rouse my wrath not to-day; It would ruin both thee and me.  SIEGFRIED      Still art thou dumb,     Stubborn old man?     Stand to one side, then;     That pathway, I know, Leads to the slumbering maid;     For thither the wood-bird Was guiding when he flew off.          [_It suddenly becomes dark again._  WANDERER          [_Breaking out in anger and assuming a commanding         attitude._  In fear of its life it fled.     It knew that here     Was the ravens' lord; Dire his plight were he caught!     The way that it guided     Thou shalt not go!  SIEGFRIED          [_Amazed, falls hack and assumes a defiant         attitude._      Hoho! Interferer!     Who then art thou That wilt not let me pass?  WANDERER  Fear thou the rock's defender!     My might it is Holds the maiden fettered by sleep.     He who would wake her,     He who would win her, Impotent makes me for ever.      A burning sea     Encircles the maid,     Fires fiercely glowing     Surround the rock;     He who craves the bride The flames must boldly defy.          [_He points with his spear towards the rocky         heights._      Look up above!     That light dost thou see?     The surging heat,     The splendour, grows;     Clouds of fire rolling,     Tongues of flame writhing,     Roaring and raging,     Come ravening down.     Thy head now     Is flooded with light;          [_A flickering glow, increasing in brightness,         appears on the summit of the rock._      The fire will seize thee,     Seize and devour thee.-- Back, back, there, foolhardy boy!  SIEGFRIED  Stand back, old babbler, thyself! For where the fire is burning, To Brünnhilde yonder I go!          [_He advances; the Wanderer bars his way._  WANDERER  Hast thou no fear of the fire, Then barred by my spear be thy path!     I still hold the haft     That conquers all;     The sword thou dost wield It shivered long ago: Upon my spear eternal     Break it once more.          [_He stretches out his spear._  SIEGFRIED [_Drawing his sword._      'Tis my father's foe,     Found here at last!     Now, then, for vengeance!     In luck am I!     Brandish thy spear: My sword will hew it in twain!          [_With one stroke he hews the Wanderer's spear in         two pieces. Lightning flashes from the spear up         towards the rocks, where the light, until now dim,         begins to flame brighter and brighter. A violent         thunder-clap, which quickly dies away, accompanies         the stroke._  WANDERER          [_Quietly picking up the pieces of the spear which         have fallen at his feet._  Fare on! I cannot prevent thee!          [_He suddenly disappears in utter darkness._  SIEGFRIED  With his spear in splinters Vanished the coward!          [_The growing brightness of the clouds of fire,         which keep sinking down lower and lower, attracts         Siegfried's eye._  Ha! Rapturous fire! Glorious light! Shining my pathway Opens before me. In fiery flames plunging, Through fire I will win to the bride! Hoho! Hahei! To summon a comrade I call!          [_He sets his horn to his lips and plunges into         the fiery billows, which, flowing down from the         heights, now spread over the foreground. Siegfried,         who is soon lost to view, seems, from the sound         of his horn, to be ascending the mountain. The         flames begin to fade, and change gradually into a         dissolving cloud lit by the glow of dawn._      _The thin cloud has resolved itself into a fine     rose-coloured veil of mist, which so divides that     the upper part rises and disappears, disclosing the     bright blue sky of day; whilst on the edge of the     rocky height, now becoming visible (exactly the     same scene as in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49525"],["title","First Lensman (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note: Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

The Patrol battle cruisers swerved to meet them, and a miles-long cone of pure energy ravened out at the invaders, destroying whatever it touched.  But the moment before the force beam struck, thousands of tiny objects dropped from the enemy fleet and, faster than light, flashed straight at their target--each one an atom bomb powerful enough to destroy Patrol Headquarters by itself!  The Galactic Patrol--and civilization itself--had seconds to live. Unless a miracle happened....  A LENSMAN ADVENTURE  _Second in the Great Series_     CHAPTER 1   The visitor, making his way unobserved through the crowded main laboratory of The Hill, stepped up to within six feet of the back of a big Norwegian seated at an electrono-optical bench. Drawing an automatic pistol, he shot the apparently unsuspecting scientist seven times, as fast as he could pull the trigger; twice through the brain, five times, closely spaced, through the spine.  \"Ah, Gharlane of Eddore, I have been expecting you to look me up. Sit down.\" Blonde, blue-eyed Dr. Nels Bergenholm, completely undisturbed by the passage of the stream of bullets through his head and body, turned and waved one huge hand at a stool beside his own.  \"But those were not ordinary projectiles!\" the visitor protested. Neither person--or rather, entity--was in the least surprised that no one else had paid any attention to what had happened, but it was clear that the one was taken aback by the failure of his murderous attack. \"They should have volatilized that form of flesh--should at least have blown you back to Arisia, where you belong.\"  \"Ordinary or extraordinary, what matter? As you, in the guise of Gray Roger, told Conway Costigan a short time since, 'I permitted that, as a demonstration of futility.' Know, Gharlane, once and for all, that you will no longer be allowed to act directly against any adherent of Civilization, wherever situate. We of Arisia will not interfere in person with your proposed conquest of the two galaxies as you have planned it, since the stresses and conflicts involved are necessary--and, I may add, sufficient--to produce the Civilization which must and shall come into being. Therefore, neither will you, or any other Eddorian, so interfere. You will go back to Eddore and you will stay there.\"  \"Think you so?\" Gharlane sneered. \"You, who have been so afraid of us for over two thousand million Tellurian years that you dared not let us even learn of you? So afraid of us that you dared not take any action to avert the destruction of any one of your budding Civilizations upon any one of the worlds of either galaxy? So afraid that you dare not, even now, meet me mind to mind, but insist upon the use of this slow and unsatisfactory oral communication between us?\"  \"Either your thinking is loose, confused, and turbid, which I do not believe to be the case, or you are trying to lull me into believing that you are stupid.\" Bergenholm's voice was calm, unmoved. \"I do not _think_ that you will go back to Eddore; I know it. You, too, as soon as you have become informed upon certain matters, will know it. You protest against the use of spoken language because it is, as you know, the easiest, simplest, and surest way of preventing you from securing any iota of the knowledge for which you are so desperately searching. As to a meeting of our two minds, they met fully just before you, operating as Gray Roger, remembered that which your entire race forgot long ago. As a consequence of that meeting I so learned every line and vibration of your life pattern as to be able to greet you by your symbol, Gharlane of Eddore, whereas you know nothing of me save that I am an Arisian, a fact which has been obvious from the first.\"  In an attempt to create a diversion, Gharlane released the zone of compulsion which he had been holding; but the Arisian took it over so smoothly that no human being within range was conscious of any change.  \"It is true that for many cycles of time we concealed our existence from you,\" Bergenholm went on without a break. \"Since the reason for that concealment will still further confuse you, I will tell you what it was. Had you Eddorians learned of us sooner you might have been able to forge a weapon of power sufficient to prevent the accomplishment of an end which is now certain.  \"It is true that your operations as Lo Sung of Uighar were not constrained. As Mithridates of Pontus--as Sulla, Marius, and Nero of Rome--as Hannibal of Carthage--as those self-effacing wights Alcixerxes of Greece and Menocoptes of Egypt--as Genghis Khan and Attila and the Kaiser and Mussolini and Hitler and the Tyrant of Asia--you were allowed to do as you pleased. Similar activities upon Rigel Four, Velantia, Palain Seven, and elsewhere were also allowed to proceed without effective opposition. With the appearance of Virgil Samms, however, the time arrived to put an end to your customary pernicious, obstructive, and destructive activities. I therefore interposed a barrier between you and those who would otherwise be completely defenseless against you.\"  \"But why now? Why not thousands of cycles ago? And why Virgil Samms?\"  \"To answer those questions would be to give you valuable data. You may--too late--be able to answer them yourself. But to continue: you accuse me, and all Arisia, of cowardice; an evidently muddy and inept thought. Reflect, please, upon the completeness of your failure in the affair of Roger's planetoid; upon the fact that you have accomplished nothing whatever since that time; upon the situation in which you now find yourself.  \"Even though the trend of thought of your race is basically materialistic and mechanistic, and you belittle ours as being 'philosophic' and 'impractical', you found--much to your surprise--that your most destructive physical agencies are not able to affect even this form of flesh which I am now energizing, to say nothing of affecting the reality which is I.  \"If this episode is the result of the customary thinking of the second-in-command of Eddore's Innermost Circle ... but no, my visualization cannot be that badly at fault. Overconfidence--the tyrant's innate proclivity to underestimate an opponent--these things have put you into a false position; but I greatly fear that they will not operate to do so in any really important future affair.\"  \"Rest assured that they will not!\" Gharlane snarled. \"It may not be--exactly--cowardice. It is, however, something closely akin. If you could have acted effectively against us at any time in the past, you would have done so. If you could act effectively against us now, you would be acting, not talking. That is elementary--self-evidently true. So true that you have not tried to deny it--nor would you expect me to believe you if you did.\" Cold black eyes stared level into icy eyes of Norwegian blue.  \"Deny it? No. I am glad, however, that you used the word 'effectively' instead of 'openly'; for we have been acting effectively against you ever since these newly-formed planets cooled sufficiently to permit of the development of intelligent life.\"  \"What? You have? How?\"  \"That, too, you may learn--too late. I have now said all I intend to say. I will give you no more information. Since you already know that there are more adult Arisians than there are Eddorians, so that at least one of us can devote his full attention to blocking the direct effort of any one of you, it is clear to you that it makes no difference to me whether you elect to go or to stay. I can and I will remain here as long as you do; I can and I will accompany you whenever you venture out of the volume of space protected by Eddorian screen, wherever you go. The election is yours.\"  Gharlane disappeared. So did the Arisian--instantaneously. Dr. Nels Bergenholm, however, remained. Turning, he resumed his work where he had left off, knowing exactly what he had been doing and exactly what he was going to do to finish it. He released the zone of compulsion, which he had been holding upon every human being within sight or hearing, so dexterously that no one suspected, then or ever, that anything out of the ordinary had happened. He knew these things and did these things in spite of the fact that the form of flesh which his fellows of the Triplanetary Service knew as Nels Bergenholm was then being energized, not by the stupendously powerful mind of Drounli the Molder, but by an Arisian child too young to be of any use in that which was about to occur.  Arisia was ready. Every Arisian mind capable of adult, or of even near-adult thinking was poised to act when the moment of action should come. They were not, however, tense. While not in any sense routine, that which they were about to do had been foreseen for many cycles of time. They knew exactly what they were going to do, and exactly how to do it. They waited.  \"My visualization is not entirely clear concerning the"]]]
