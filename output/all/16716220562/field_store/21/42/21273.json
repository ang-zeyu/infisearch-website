Heavens! was this the great enchantress that had drawn monarchs at her chariot-wheels? Those heavy muscular limbs, those thick ankles, those cavernous eyes, that stereotyped smile, those crudely painted cheeks! Where were the vermeil blooms, the liquid expressive eyes, the harmonious limbs of Animula?  The Signorina danced. What gross, discordant movements! The play of her limbs was all false and artificial. Her bounds were painful athletic efforts; her poses were angular and distressed the eye. I could bear it no longer; with an exclamation of disgust that drew every eye upon me, I rose from my seat in the very middle of the Signorina's _pas-de-fasination_, and abruptly quitted the house.  I hastened home to feast my eyes once more on the lovely form of my sylph. I felt that henceforth to combat this passion would be impossible. I applied my eye to the lens. Animula was there--but what could have happened? Some terrible change seemed to have taken place during my absence. Some secret grief seemed to cloud the lovely features of her I gazed upon. Her face had grown thin and haggard; her limbs trailed heavily; the wondrous luster of her golden hair had faded. She was ill!--ill, and I could not assist her! I believe at that moment I would have gladly forfeited all claims to my human birthright, if I could only have been dwarfed to the size of an animalcule, and permitted to console her from whom fate had forever divided me.  I racked my brain for the solution of this mystery. What was it that afflicted the sylph? She seemed to suffer intense pain. Her features contracted, and she even writhed, as if with some internal agony. The wondrous forests appeared also to have lost half their beauty. Their hues were dim and in some places faded away altogether. I watched Animula for hours with a breaking heart, and she seemed absolutely to wither away under my very eye. Suddenly I remembered that I had not looked at the water-drop for several days. In fact, I hated to see it; for it reminded me of the natural barrier between Animula and myself. I hurriedly looked down on the stage of the microscope. The slide was still there--but, great heavens! the water-drop had vanished! The awful truth burst upon me; it had evaporated, until it had become so minute as to be invisible to the naked eye; I had been gazing on its last atom, the one that contained Animula--and she was dying!  I rushed again to the front of the lens, and looked through. Alas! the last agony had seized her. The rainbow-hued forests had all melted away, and Animula lay struggling feebly in what seemed to be a spot of dim light. Ah! the sight was horrible: the limbs once so round and lovely shriveling up into nothings; the eyes--those eyes that shone like heaven--being quenched into black dust; the lustrous golden hair now lank and discolored. The last throe came. I beheld that final struggle of the blackening form--and I fainted.  When I awoke out of a trance of many hours, I found myself lying amid the wreck of my instrument, myself as shattered in mind and body as it. I crawled feebly to my bed, from which I did not rise for months.  They say now that I am mad; but they are mistaken. I am poor, for I have neither the heart nor the will to work; all my money is spent, and I live on charity. Young men's associations that love a joke invite me to lecture on optics before them, for which they pay me, and laugh at me while I lecture. \"Linley, the mad microscopist,\" is the name I go by. I suppose that I talk incoherently while I lecture. Who could talk sense when his brain is haunted by such ghastly memories, while ever and anon among the shapes of death I behold the radiant form of my lost Animula!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],["title","Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#0)"],["body","(http://mormontextsproject.org)       Origin of the \"Reorganized\" Church and the Question of Succession  By Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr.  Salt Lake City  1909    INTRODUCTION.  During the summer of 1906 and continuing until the summer of 1907, a number of Reorganite ministers who were engaged in missionary work in Salt Lake City and Ogden, were greatly encouraged by one or two apostates and the local anti-\"Mormon\" press. Their method of proselyting was of the usual nature, a tirade of abuse and false accusation hurled at the authorities of the Church. Encouraged by the anti-\"Mormon\" help, they became extremely vindictive in their references to President Brigham Young and the present Church authorities. Their sermons were so bitter and malignant--which has been the character of most of their work from the beginning, in Utah--that they raised considerable protest from many respectable citizens. Even non-\"Mormons\" declared that in no other community would such vicious attacks be tolerated. It appeared at times that these missionaries were attempting to provoke the \"Mormon\" people to some act of violence, that it might be seized upon and published to the world through the anti-\"Mormon\" press that they had been mobbed, and thus capital for their cause be made of it. Fortunately they were not molested to the credit of the people so constantly abused. One of these meetings was attended by a prominent gentleman from the East who was somewhat acquainted with Utah and her people, he said, in conversation with the writer a few days later, that never in his experience has he witnessed such a thing before. \"If that fellow\"--referring to a Reorganite who has since been promoted in his church--\"should come to our town and abuse the ministers of our church, calling them murderers, thieves and liars, as he did Brigham Young and your churchmen, we would kick him off the streets.\"  While this agitation was going on, a number of the young people of Ogden appealed to their stake presidency asking that some reply to those assaults be made for the benefit of those who were not grounded in the faith, and in danger of being deceived. Acting on this request the presidency of the Weber Stake invited the writer to speak along these lines in the Ogden Tabernacle. The invitation was accepted and two discourses were delivered, the first, March 10, 1907, on the subject of the \"Origin of the Reorganized Church,\" and the other April 28, 1907, on the question of \"Succession.\" These remarks were subsequently published in the _Deseret News_, and many requests were received asking that they be published in pamphlet form, where they could be preserved by those who had to meet the ministers of the \"Reorganization.\" An edition was therefore published in the summer of 1907, which has been disposed of, evidently without supplying the demand, for in the summer of 1909 the orders for the pamphlet were so great that is was deemed necessary to issue a second edition. In the meantime a reply appeared in the Saints' Herald, commencing with the issue of June 30, and ending that of July 21, 1909. This reply will be remembered more for the unfair way matters were treated and the fact that the greater part of the evidence was left untouched, than for any merit in the argument presented. Wherever it was deemed necessary, for the sake of those who may be deceived, answers are given in this work in footnote references to the argument set forth in the Reorganite \"defense.\" However, there was nothing presented in the \"defense\" that really required any reply; by reading carefully the discourses mentioned, the ordinary reader can readily perceive the trickery, deception and sophistry, of the Reorganite reply.  Part one of this book contains the discourse delivered in Ogden on the \"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church;\" part two contains the discourse on the \"Succession in the Presidency,\" and part three deals with the most prominent differences existing between the Church and the \"Reorganization,\" wherein they accuse us of departing from the doctrines of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This matter in part three is added by request of a number of parties who have had to meet the sophistry of the Reorganite missionaries.  This book is not put forth to replace any other work, neither with the idea that it will turn Reorganite ministers from the folly of their ways; but with the hope that some honest soul who have been deceived may see the light and embrace the truth, and that the feet of the weak may be strengthened in the path of righteousness that they may not falter on their way. Neither is it intended to be an exhaustive treatise in of the subjects it contains; the idea has been in the main, to present matters that have not been treated elsewhere.--J. F. S., Jr.    ORIGIN OF THE \"REORGANIZED\" CHURCH.  The Question of Rejection--Salvation for the Dead  * * * * *  Remarks made in the Weber Stake Tabernacle, Ogden City, March 10, 1907, by Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr.  * * * * *  My beloved brethren and sisters and friends: The great majority of you who are assembled here today are, without doubt, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I suppose that most of you have a divine testimony of the truth of this latter-day work--the Gospel of Christ--which we have received. To you who have a testimony, my remarks shall not be addressed particularly, but if you will bear with me in what I have to say that I may be led to say something that will strengthen the faith of those who may be weak, or that will encourage those who have no faith at all, I will feel amply paid.  I am not here for the purpose of assailing any man for his religion, for we Latter-day Saints hold that every man is entitled to his religious views and should have the privilege of worshiping according to the dictates of his conscience, let him worship, how, where, or what he may. And we will protect him in this right. But we are opposed to the custom adopted by certain men who travel through the settlements of our people abusing the authorities of the Church, distorting our doctrines and defaming the dead, for the purpose of destroying the faith and confidence of the Latter-day Saints. Therefore in treating the subject of the \"Reorganized\" Church this afternoon, it will be in the spirit of self-defense.  We will first consider the statement made by the senior senator from Michigan, Mr. Burrows, in his speech delivered in the United States Senate on the 11th of last December. After stating that the membership of the Church at the martyrdom in 1844, was 50,000 adherents, he continues:      \"The death of Joseph Smith in 1844, carried dismay and     demoralization throughout the entire membership of the Mormon     Church, scattering its adherents in divers directions and for the     time being seemed to presage the complete overthrow and dissolution     of the organization. Recovering, however, from the shock, the     scattered bands soon reappeared in various parts of the country     and promulgated their doctrines with increased zeal, and set to     work to reassemble and reorganize their scattered forces, resulting     finally in the formation of what is now known and recognized as     the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with     headquarters at Lamoni, Iowa, and presided over by Joseph Smith, a     son of the prophet.\"  He continues:      \"During this period of disintegration one Brigham Young, who     had identified himself with the 'Mormon Organization' as early     as 1832, a man of indomitable will and undaunted courage, bold     and unscrupulous, seized upon the occasion of the demoralization     incident to the death of the prophet to place himself at the head     of some 5,000 Mormons, and marching over desert and mountain,     established himself with his adherents in the valley of Salt     Lake, July 24, 1847, then Mexican territory, where he undoubtedly     indulged the hope that the new doctrine of polygamy about to be     publicly proclaimed by him might be promulgated with impunity     and practiced and maintained without interference by the United     States.\"[1]  Now, this is not true. The senior senator from Michigan has here stated the position of the \"Reorganized\" Church as capably and clearly as any member of that sect could possibly have done, and in exactly the same way that they have stated it for the past forty-seven years. Why he was led to make such a statement he best may know, but it shows the careful coaching that he has received by members of the \"Reorganized\" Church in their opposition to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  In a pamphlet published by that organization in 1864, the following appears:      \"The greater portion of the Church did not follow this Brigham     Young, and in obedience to the revelation in relation to gathering,     remained around about the land of Zion, waiting for the Lord to     again reveal Himself; and today where there is one Saint who was in     the Church in the days of Joseph the martyr, now associated with     Brigham Young, there are ten of those old members standing aloof or     rejoicing under the administration of the word of the Lord through     his son Joseph.\"   SAINTS FOLLOWED PRESIDENT YOUNG.  And this is not true. Now I intend to show that at the martyrdom the Latter-day Saints followed President Brigham Young and the Twelve. And too, in accordance with divine revelation. For we learn in the Doctrine and Covenants that the quorum of Apostles is equal in authority with the First Presidency and it is their right to take the lead of Church affairs and the presidency in the absence of the First Presidency, or when that quorum is invaded by the death of the President of the Church.  At the time of the martyrdom the Church in and about Nauvoo, the headquarters, numbered not to exceed 20,000 souls. This information is based on the best possible authority. And while this was not all the"]]]
