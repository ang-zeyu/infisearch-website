COLORATION   The general coloration of waxwings is cryptic, that is to say, concealing or blending. The lighter color of the venter, especially of the belly, contrasts with the duller, darker vinaceous color of the dorsum. Several ruptive marks tend to obliterate the outline of the body. The crest of the head, when elevated, tends to elongate the body, making the outline less like that of a normal bird. The facial mask effectively breaks up the outline of the head, and conceals the bright eye, which would otherwise be strikingly distinct. The white spots on the distal ends of the secondaries of _B. garrula_ and the yellow color on the distal ends of the rectrices (red in _B. japonica_) are also ruptive. These ruptive marks on an otherwise blending type of plumage might be important to waxwings, and probably are more effective when the birds remain motionless in either a well-lighted area or in one that is partly in shadow, rather than in one that is wholly in shadow.  The red wax tips on the secondaries of the flight feathers, and sometimes found on the ends of the rectrices in _Bombycilla_, are puzzling and no wholly convincing reason has been suggested for their occurrence. Two instances are known of yellow instead of red-colored wax tips in _B. cedrorum_ (Farley, 1924). It is well known that many individuals, especially of _B. cedrorum_, do not possess these tips; they are absent in a smaller proportion of individuals of _B. garrula_. Of the 53 skins of _B. cedrorum_ available in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, which might be taken as a sampling at random of the general population of this species, only 17 possess wax tips. A few specimens are unilateral, and the tips are of varying sizes in different individuals. Of these 17 birds, 6 are female and 7 male, the others being unsexed at the time of skinning. This proportion is, roughly, half and half. Of the seven skins of _B. garrula pallidiceps_ in the same Museum, five possess the tips, and two that are females have no trace of the red tips at all. Of the five which do have the tips, two are males, two are females, and one is unsexed. In a series of 13 specimens of the three subspecies of _B. garrula_, loaned by the United States National Museum, all but two individuals possess the tips on the secondaries, and, in addition, four specimens, equally divided between the two sexes, have color on the rachis of some rectrices, and small appendages of pigment extend beyond the feathers. Stevenson (1882) found that among 144 specimens of _B. garrula garrula_ killed "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34556"],["title","Phylogeny of the Waxwings and Allied Birds (#3)"],["body","storms in England in the winter of 1866-67, 69 individuals had wax tips. Of these, 41 were males and 27 were females; the remaining one was of uncertain sex. Among 38 definitely sexed _B. garrula pallidiceps_ in the California Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy, Swarth (1922:276) lists tips in 22 males and 16 females. These data indicate that the proportion of birds with the wax tips is higher in _B. garrula_ than in _B. cedrorum_. The potentiality for wax tips is possibly inherited according to Mendelian ratio.  _Bombycilla japonica_ is of interest in that the adults, at least, seldom have the waxy appendages. Nevertheless, in the specimens observed, the entire distal ends of the feathers normally possessing the tips in other species are suffused with red color. This may be the original condition of all waxwings, or perhaps, instead, this species is in a transitional stage in the development of the tips. Swarth (1922:277) says concerning the probable derivation of the wax tips in _B. garrula_ (and in _B. cedrorum_): \"the ornamentation, in fact, may well have begun with the coloring of the shaft, spreading later over adjoining feather barbs. The last stage would have been the coalescing of the barbs, forming the waxlike scale as is now seen. Various steps of this hypothetical development are supplied in the wing and tail feathers of different birds of this series.\" _Bombycilla japonica_ thus may be close to the ancestral condition in the waxwing stock in the development of the waxy appendage.  The rectrices of all three species of waxwings seldom possess the wax tips, unless the secondaries have the maximum number of tips. In these individuals, the pigment seems to \"spill over\" onto the tail feathers. Eight is the maximum number of tips found on the secondaries. Rectrices with wax tips are more frequently found in _B. garrula_, and only occasionally in _B. cedrorum_. The pigment in the tip of the tail of _B. japonica_ is red rather than yellow as it is in the other two species, and some individuals of the Japanese Waxwing show a slight amount of coalescence of wax in the tail feathers as well as in the secondaries.  If the tips were present in all members of the two species, it could be postulated, in line with recent investigational work by Tinbergen (1947), that the tips are in the nature of species \"releasers,\" facilitating species recognition. Such recognition is now regarded as of prime importance in the formation of species. It is improbable that sex recognition may be aided, as there is no evidence to indicate that the tips are found predominantly in either sex.  The wax tips are not limited to the adult birds in the species _B. garrula_. Swarth (_op. cit._) mentions the capture of several young Bohemian Waxwings, and describes them as \"possessing all the distinctive markings of the most highly developed adult.\" This includes wax appendages, and several citations are given (Wolley 1857, Gould 1862) to indicate that this is the rule rather than the exception, not only for the American subspecies _pallidiceps_, but at least for the European subspecies _garrula_ as well. On the other hand, the young of _B. cedrorum_ lack the wax tips, at least as far as available data show.  Some characteristics of living animals are of the \"relict\" type; that is to say, they were developed in ancient times when some unknown ecological factor was operative which is no longer demonstrable, and the characteristic is now neutral or at least not detrimental, although of no positive value to the organism. Possibly the wax tips of waxwings are thus to be explained. I am more inclined to the opinion that the wax tips are adaptations to present-day ecological conditions for the birds.  The wax tips are ruptive in effect, since the birds, especially in winter, are habitués of bushes and trees that have berries, and the tips, on the otherwise dull body, suggest berries. The red tips tend further to disrupt the body outline at the midline, or slightly posterior to this. Perhaps the wax tips on the rectrices emphasize the end of the tail, the region of the body that is the least vital and that may be expendable in times of pursuit by an enemy.  Any characteristic is of survival value to an organism if in any way the characteristic enhances the chances of survival up to the time when the organism can successfully raise even a few young to maturity. If that character, as for example, the red wax tips on the secondaries, helps to maintain the individual until it can raise to independence a greater number than merely a few young, such a character can be said to be of greater survival value. The character may be effective for a brief period of time and may be uncommon; it might be effective for a split second in time, and only at a particular stage in the life history.  The winter period probably is the most hazardous for waxwings, in that they then depend at times upon long flights to find food. The food is vegetable, and thus is comparatively low in food value; the birds must ingest large quantities of berries or dried fruits to maintain themselves. In winter, in northern latitudes at least, predators are more apt to prey upon those species which, like waxwings, do not migrate south. The winter months are those in which waxwings frequent berry bushes, and it may well be that in these months, the wax tips that appear like berries, are especially valuable to the birds, and operate selectively.  It is suggested, therefore, that the wax tips are of positive value to waxwings, rather than being relict characters. Coalescence of pigment has taken place in the formation of the wax tips. _B. japonica_ is closer to the ancestral stock insofar as wax tips are concerned, and generally lacks the tips. _B. cedrorum_ has the tips in approximately half of the adults, and not at all in the young. _B. garrula_ has the tips in almost all the adults, and in a like proportion of the young, and probably has evolved further in the development and retention of the wax tips than has either of the other two species.  The streaked plumage of _Dulus_ is decidedly generalized, and is probably more nearly like the color of the ancestral stock. In this connection it is notable that young Cedar Waxwings are streaked, and young Bohemian Waxwings are streaked to a lesser degree. This streaking is apparently a recapitulation of the feather color of the stock. Perhaps the color of _Dulus_ has not changed, as the streaking would not be a disadvantage to the birds in their environment of light and shadow. In joining together in groups and in the construction of large communal nests, _Dulus_ has evidently gained sufficient protection against predators; other birds solve this problem by modifying their coloration.  _Ptilogonys_ is ruptively colored, but in a different fashion than _Bombycilla_. The tail markings, the distinct yellow on the under tail coverts, the sharply marked pileum, are all examples of ruptive coloration. The generally lighter venter (especially under tail coverts), the crest that may be elevated, and the generally drab bluish dorsum, are cryptic and serve to hide the animal insofar as is possible considering its habits. The very conspicuous coloration of the male, in contrast to the more drab color of the female, however, would lead one to believe that in _Ptilogonys_, following the pattern of many passerine birds, the male leads a predator from the nest, leaving the drab female to incubate the eggs, and thus preserve the young.  It is difficult to suggest reasons for the brilliant coloration of the male _Phainopepla_, unless it is for decoying predators away from the nest. Possibly some birds survive not because of, but in spite of, their coloration, and _Phainopepla_ may be a case of this sort. Anyone who has observed _Phainopepla_ in life will agree, certainly, that the male makes no attempt at concealment, and flaunts his color to all comers.  The coloration of _Phainoptila_, in contrast to _Phainopepla_, is much more plain, and is suited to its habits of brush dwelling; in a brush habitat the drab coloration is difficult to detect. The Yellowish Olive under tail-coverts and the Olivaceous dorsum are all evidences of cryptic coloration, and undoubtedly, this bird depends upon hiding for escape from its enemies, since it is a bird of the dense forest cover.  Coloration, which varies relatively rapidly in response to differing ecological conditions, has become more different in the species of Bombycillidae than is true in many other families of passerine birds. The explanation lies in early geographical isolation of the three subfamilies, with consequent radiation in three directions. Waxwings have become adapted by possessing a thick protective layer of feathers and drab coloration broken by ruptive marks. They still retain the streaked plumage, which is probably ancestral, in the juveniles; this is lost at the first molt in the fall. In its evolution, _Dulus_ has developed large feet, heavy decurved beak, and the large communal nest that affords protection from enemies; as a consequence, perhaps _Dulus_ did not need a plumage different from the primitive and streaked one. The survival of _Dulus_ may not have depended on either ruptive marks or on brilliant and outstanding plumage. The large feet and large bill seem to be responses to particular ecological requirements, as will be shown later.  The Ptilogonatinae, with habits paralleling those of the flycatchers, probably are considerably modified from the ancestral stock; the coloration probably is more brilliant and conspicuous. Perhaps this type of coloration and the habit of capturing insects from a perch are correlated. Some amount of territoriality is characteristic of this subfamily and dimorphism in color--the plumage of the male is outstandingly conspicuous--possibly is of selective value to the race. In a tropical forest community, a duller pattern possibly would be more visible and thus would "]]]
