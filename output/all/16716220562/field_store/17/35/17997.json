Good implies its opposite, evil. Law, which carries with it the idea of order, implies disorder, and takes measures against it. We become conscious of the truth of the doctrine here announced at every turn. In the astronomic order it is seen in the centripetal and centrifugal forces--the holding together and the flying apart forces. In chemistry it is manifest in the composing and decomposing forces; in positive and negative electricity. It is seen in light and darkness; heat, cold; movement, repose; joy, sorrow; pleasure, pain; and so following. Our Prophet's teaching on this line runs to the extent that existence itself is made to depend upon it, this antinomy of things. Listen:      \"And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is     no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there     is no righteousness. And if there is no righteousness there is no     happiness. And if there is no righteousness nor happiness, there     is no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not, there is     no God. And if there is no God, we are not, neither the earth; for     there could have been no creation of things; neither to act, nor     to be acted upon.\"  Have you ever thought what a dreadful world this would be without this duality--the opposite existences here contended for? Imagine all things in the world to be white! No contrasts in coloring! Universal insanity must result. The \"dread of sinking into naught\" is matched by the dread of having things resolved into a \"compound of one.\" The absence of this necessary \"opposition in all things\" is well put, by a very recent philosophical writer, in these terms:      \"Evil exists in the balance of natural forces. * * * It is also     the background of good, the incentive to good, and the trial of     good, without which good could not be. As the virtue of courage     could not exist without the evil of danger, and as the virtue of     sympathy could not exist without the evil of suffering, so no     other virtue could exist without its corresponding evil. In a     world without evil--if such a world be really conceivable, all men     would have perfect health, perfect intelligence, and perfect     morals. No one could gain or impart information, each one's cup of     knowledge being full. The temperature would stand forever at 70     degrees, both heat and cold [in excess] being evil. There could be     no progress, since progress is the overcoming of evil. A world     without evil would be as toil without exertion, as light without     darkness, as a battle with no antagonist. It would be a world     without meaning.\"  The German philosopher Kant put the same thought in beautiful form when he said, in substance: The dove, as she speeds her way through the air, may marvel at the resistance to her flight by the atmosphere, but we know that but for that resistance she could not fly at all. So far Kant. Applied, the conclusion would be: As the resistance of the air to the flight of the dove, so is evil to the progress of Intelligences.  [In the December number, 1908, of the \"Cosmopolitan Magazine,\" I find the following reflections, by Mr. Ambrose Bierce, on the point here discussed; and while not accepting, without modification, every thought expressed, I consider the passage too pertinent, and too rich to be denied admittance into these pages:  \"Let us for a moment suppose this country's reformers to have achieved their amiable purpose--their purposes, rather, for these are as the leaves of the forest, and no two alike. We have, then, a country in which are no poverty, no contention, no tyranny nor oppression, no peril to life or limb, no disease--and so forth. How delightful! What a good and happy people! Alas, no! With poverty have vanished benevolence, providence, and the foresight which, born of the fear of individual want, stands guard at a thousand gates to defend the general good. The charitable impulse is dead in every breast, and gratitude, atrophied by disuse, has no longer a place among human sentiments and emotions. With no more fighting among ourselves we have lost the power of resentment and resistance: a car-load of Mexicans or a shipful of Japanese can invade our fool's paradise and enslave us, as the Spaniards overran Peru and the British subdued India. (Hailers of \"the dawn of the new era\" will, I trust, provide that it dawns everywhere at once or here last of all.) Having no oppression to resist and no perils to apprehend, we no longer need the courage to defy, nor the fortitude to endure. Heroism is a failing memory and magnanimity a dream of the past; for not only are the virtues known by contrast with the vices, they spring from the same seed, grow in the same soil, ripen in the same sunshine, and perish in the same frost. A fine race of mollycoddles we should be without our sins and sufferings! In a world without evils there would be one supreme evil--existence. We need not fear any such condition. Progress is infected with the germs of reversion; on the grave of the civilization of today will squat the barbarian of tomorrow, \"with a glory in his bosom\" that will transfigure him the day after. The alternation is one that we can neither hasten nor retard, for our success baffles us. If, for example, we could abolish war, disease, and famine, the race would multiply to the point of \"standing room only\"--a condition prophesying war, disease, and famine. Wherefore the wisest prayer is this, \"O Lord, make thy servant strong to fight and impotent to prevail.\"]  \"Moral evil,\" then, is not a created thing. It is one of the eternal existences, just as duration is and space. It is as old as law--old as Truth, old as this eternal universe. Intelligences must adjust themselves to these eternal existences; this, the measure of their duty.   THE INTELLIGENT ENTITY: Of man's spirit, called often by other names--\"mind,\" \"intelligence,\" \"ego,\" \"self;\" but by whatever name it is called, and all nice distinctions set aside, here I mean that conscious, self-determining entity, which thinks, reasons, wills, loves, aspires--I mean the real man. Let us in our discourse call him spirit. Of man, then, thus understood, our Prophet taught:      \"The soul--the mind of man--the immortal spirit--where did it come     from? All learned men and doctors of divinity say that God created     it in the beginning; but it is not so; the very idea lessens man     in my estimation. I do not believe the doctrine. I know better. *     * * We say that God himself is a self-existent Being. Who told you     so? It is correct enough, but how did it get into your heads? Who     told you that man did not exist in like manner, upon the same     principles? * * * Is it logical to say that the intelligence of     spirits is immortal, and yet that it had a beginning? The     intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an     end. * * * There never was a time when there were not spirits; for     they are co-eternal with our Father in heaven. * * * The spirit of     man is not a created being; it existed from eternity, and will     exist to eternity.\"  Man, then, in the Prophet's philosophy, is not a created, but a self-existent entity, one of the eternal things; not created, really uncreatable, as also indestructible. Not of earth origin, but existing in heavens without number, brother to all Intelligences--brother to the Christ with the rest. \"I was in the beginning with the Father,\" our Prophet represents the Christ as saying--\"I was in the beginning with the Father. * * * Ye [the brethren present when the revelation was given] were also in the beginning with the Father, that which is spirit. * * * Man [the race] was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\"  But while these spirits or intelligent entities may be equal as to their eternity, they differ in the degree of intelligence--so our Prophet teaches: Where two things exist, one higher than another, there may be another thing higher yet. Where two things exist, one superior to another, there may be another still superior, and so on. So where two spirits exist, one being more intelligent than the other, there may be another more intelligent than the first. Yet, notwithstanding this difference in degree of intelligence, they are equal as to their eternity. \"They existed before,\" said our Prophet, \"they shall have no end; they shall exist after, for they are _gnolaum_, or eternal.\" It is this difference in Intelligences that leads to order in this universe of ours. The more advanced Intelligences governing, controlling, devising, organizing, forming societies, making governments--all which shall tend to increase the glory and power and joy of Intelligences; to this end bringing into existence what we call worlds, world-systems, guiding them through immense cycles of time, and through processes that lead from chaos to cosmos, from telestial to celestial, and when attaining a point beyond which they may not be exalted in their present forms, breaking those forms, disintegrating them, throwing them back--these baser material things, not Intelligences--back to chaos, to be brought forth again to reach a grander cosmos--worlds without number have thus passed away, by the word of God's power, and many now stand, innumerable unto man; and as one earth and its heavens shall pass away, so shall another come, and there is no end to these works, this evolution and this devolution. And so the eternal drama proceeds. Intelligences meanwhile standing unhurt amidst this organization and disorganization of worlds; these integrating and disintegrating elements, this movement from lower to higher forms, from little to greater excellences; yet this without attaining to \"highest\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35360"],["title","Joseph Smith the Prophet-Teacher: A Discourse (#6)"],["body","\"perfect,\" because advancing in the infinite, which knows no ultimates. Meanwhile Intelligences, amid these changes, under the law of eternal progress, are ever-increasing in power, glory, might, dominion, love, benevolence, charity, justice, and all else that can make for the increase of their power and glory. In which strivings and achievements eternal evil is present; makes necessary and possible, in fact, the very strivings and achievements; and is the \"foil on which good produces itself, and becomes known.\"   THE RELATIONSHIP OF INTELLIGENCES: It is seen that our Prophet taught the eternity of Intelligences; and that they are not only not created, but uncreatable; that though they differ in degree of intelligence, of knowledge, of love, hence differ also in power, in influence, in glory--in all that comes from soul power. The presiding Intelligence to that order of things and beings to which we belong, is represented as standing among the Intelligences destined to our earth, \"and among these there were many of the noble and great ones.\" And the Presiding Intelligence said: \"These I will make my Rulers; for He stood among those that were spirits, and He saw that they were good.\" \"The noble and great ones\" are made Rulers; and doubtless the principle here operating in respect of those Intelligences destined to our earth, operates in all worlds and world systems. Some of the \"Noble and Great Ones\" stand at the head of worlds and groups of worlds, forming Grand Presidencies, in order and gradation based upon their power and appointment. All which is dependent upon their intelligence, their character, their nobility and greatness--measured by their capacity to serve. Each one of such \"Rulers\"--and each Intelligence, in fact--independent in the sphere in which he is appointed to act, yet acting in harmony, through attainment of the knowledge of Truth, with all other exalted and sanctified souls--these are Gods, or the Rulers in this Universe. These make up David's \"congregation of the Mighty,\" in which God, \"More intelligent than them all,\" standeth and judgeth \"among the Gods.\" (Psalms 82: 1.) And to these, in their several stations, other Intelligences owe loyalty, submission--call it worship if you like; at any rate it must be unshaken loyalty, in order to attain the ends proposed in all \"plans of salvation,\" \"gospels,\" \"societies,\" \"kingdoms of God,\" and the like, in which \"plans,\" \"gospels\" and the rest, each spirit agreed and covenanted to accept, as also to obey and honor those appointed to direct and bring to pass that which was ordained in the councils of Divine Intelligences. \"At the first organization in heaven,\" said the Prophet, speaking with reference to matters pertaining to our earth, and the probation of spirits upon it in earth-life--\"at the first organization in heaven we were all present, and saw the Savior chosen and appointed, and the plan of salvation made, and we sanctioned it.\" This the meaning of \"man [the race] was also in the beginning with God.\" And as to the \"Rulers,\" \"Presidencies\"--they are not \"Rulers\" in the worldly sense of those words. \"Government\" here, \"office\" in the \"kingdom of God,\" means opportunity for service, not of mastery. \"Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you. But whosoever would be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant; even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.\" So Joseph Smith: \"The powers of heaven can only be controlled upon the principles of righteousness. When men undertake to cover their sins or to gratify their pride or vain ambition or exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men in any degree of unrighteousness, the heavens withdraw themselves, the spirit of the Lord is grieved, and when it is withdrawn, amen to the authority of that man. No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul, without hypocrisy, and without guile.\"  This, the principle of heavenly rule.   MAN'S FREEDOM: Through all that is here set forth as Joseph Smith's doctrines, it will be seen that the free moral agency of man is regarded as a reality. First, the recognition of man, as a spirit, being a self-existent entity--not a created thing; \"man [i.e., all men, the race] was in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\" Then second, \"All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all Intelligence also, otherwise there is no existence. Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man, because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light. And every man, whose spirit receiveth not the light, is under condemnation, for man is spirit.\"  The fact of free moral agency runs through all the Prophet's revelations in similar spirit. Indeed, in one scripture he represents the chief sin of Lucifer as being an attempt to \"destroy the agency of man;\" and for which he was driven forth from heaven. The effect of these two doctrines, the recognition of the spirit of man as an eternal being, and his being a free moral agent, is tremendous in accounting for things. Elsewhere, contrasting this view of things with some modern Christian views, I have said: \"As matters now stand, the usually accepted Christian doctrine on the matter of man's origin is that God of His free-will created men. That they are as He would have them, since in His act of creation He could have had them different if He had so minded. Then why should He--being infinitely wise and infinitely powerful, and infinitely good--for so the creeds represent Him--why should He create by mere act of volition, beings such as men are, not only capable of, but prone to, moral Evil? Which, in the last analysis of things, in spite of all special pleadings to the contrary, leaves responsibility for moral Evil with God? God's creative acts culminating thus, the next pertinent questions are: Then what of the decreed purpose of God to punish moral Evil? And what of the much-vaunted justice of God in that punishment? Wherein lies the just responsibility of man if he was so created as to love Evil and to follow it?\" It is revolting to reason, as it is shocking to piety, to think that God, of His own free will, created some men, not only inclined to wickedness, but desperately so inclined; while others He, of His own volition, created with dispositions naturally inclined toward goodness. In like manner stands it with man in relation to his inclination to faith, and to unbelief; and yet, under the orthodox belief all are included under one law for judgment!  On the other hand, under the conception of the existence of independent, uncreated, self-existent Intelligences, who by the inherent nature of them are of various degrees of intelligence, doubtless differing from each other in many ways, yet alike in their eternity and their freedom; with God standing in the midst of them, \"more intelligent than them all,\" and proposing the betterment of their condition--progress to higher levels of being, and power through change--under this conception of things, how stand matters? Why, ever present through all changes, through all the processes of betterment, is the self-existent entity of the \"Intelligence\" with the tremendous fact of his consciousness and his moral freedom, and his indestructibility--he has his choice of moving upward or downward in every estate he occupies; often defeating, for a time, at least, even the benevolent purposes of God respecting him, through his own perverseness; he passes through dire experiences, suffers terribly, yet learns by what he suffers, so that his very suffering becomes a means to his improvement; he learns swiftly or slowly, according to the inherent nature of him, obedience to law; he learns that \"that which is governed by law is also preserved by law, and perfected and sanctified by the same; and that which breaketh the law and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice nor judgment. Therefore they must remain filthy still.\" This conception of things relieves God of the responsibility for the nature and status of intelligences in all stages of their development; their inherent nature and their volition makes them primarily what they are, and this nature they may change, slowly, perhaps, yet change it they may. God has put them in the way of changing it, by enlarging their intelligence through change of environment, through experiences; the only way God effects these self-existent beings is favorably; He creates not their inherent nature; He is not responsible for the use they make of their freedom; nor is He the author of their sufferings when they fall into sin: that arises out of the violations of law, to which the \"Intelligence\" subscribed, and must be endured until the lessons of obedience to law are learned.  This conception of the order of things, as to the existence of \"Intelligences\" and in the moral government of the world, discovers a harmony in that government which at once challenges our admiration, and bears evidence of its truth.   ETERNITY OF RELATIONSHIPS: Matching these eternal things, an eternal universe, eternal spirit entities, eternal good, with its background of eternal evil,--eternal law, agency and the like, is the Prophet's doctrine of eternal relations. Intelligences are begotten spirits; spirits are begotten men and women; these become "]]]
