According to one theory of the Universe, the momentum of Original Impress has been tending toward this far-off, divine event ever since a scrap of fire-mist flew from the solar centre to form our planet. Not this event alone, of course; but every occurrence, past and present, from the fall of captured Troy to the fall of a captured insect. According to another theory, I hold an independent diploma as one of the architects of our Social System, with a commission to use my own judgment, and take my own risks, like any other unit of humanity. This theory, unlike the first, entails frequent hitches and cross-purposes; and to some malign operation of these I should owe my present holiday.  Orthodoxly, we are reduced to one assumption:  namely, that my indomitable old Adversary has suddenly called to mind Dr. Watts's friendly hint respecting the easy enlistment of idle hands.  Good.  If either of the two first hypotheses be correct, my enforced furlough tacitly conveys the responsibility of extending a ray of information, however narrow and feeble, across the path of such fellow-pilgrims as have led lives more sedentary than my own--particularly as I have enough money to frank myself in a frugal way for some weeks, as well as to purchase the few requisites of authorship.  If, on the other hand, my supposed safeguard of drudgery has been cut off at the meter by that amusingly short-sighted old Conspirator, it will be only fair to notify him that his age and experience, even his captivating habits and well-known hospitality, will be treated with scorn, rather than respect, in the paragraphs which he virtually forces me to write; and he is hereby invited to view his own feather on the fatal dart.  Whilst a peculiar defect--which I scarcely like to call an oversight in mental construction--shuts me out from the flowery pathway of the romancer, a co-ordinate requital endows me, I trust, with the more sterling, if less ornamental qualities of the chronicler.  This fairly equitable compensation embraces, I have been told, three distinct attributes: an intuition which reads men like sign-boards; a limpid veracity; and a memory which habitually stereotypes all impressions except those relating to personal injuries.  Submitting, then, to the constitutional interdict already glanced at, and availing myself of the implied license to utilise that homely talent of which I am the bailee, I purpose taking certain entries from my diary, and amplifying these to the minutest detail of occurrence or conversation. This will afford to the observant reader a fair picture of Life, as that engaging problem has presented itself to me.  Twenty-two consecutive editions of Lett's Pocket Diary, with one week in each opening, lie on the table before me; all filled up, and in a decent state of preservation.  I think I shall undertake the annotation of a week's record.  A man might, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt; but I shut my eyes, and take up one of the little volumes.  It proves to be the edition of 1883. Again I shut my eyes while I open the book at random.  It is the week beginning with Sunday, the 9th of September.  SUN. SEPT.  9.  Thomp.  Coop.  &c.  10-Mile Pines.  Cleo.  Duff.  Selec.  The fore part of the day was altogether devoid of interest or event. Overhead, the sun blazing wastefully and thanklessly through a rarefied atmosphere; underfoot the hot, black clay, thirsting for spring rain, and bare except for inedible roley-poleys, coarse tussocks, and the woody stubble of close-eaten salt-bush; between sky and earth, a solitary wayfarer, wisely lapt in philosophic torpor. Ten yards behind the grey saddle-horse follows a black pack-horse, lightly loaded; and three yards behind the pack-horse ambles listlessly a tall, slate-coloured kangaroo dog, furnished with the usual poison muzzle--a light wire basket, worn after the manner of a nose-bag.  Mile after mile we go at a good walk, till the dark boundary of the scrub country disappears northward in the glassy haze, and in front, southward, the level black-soil plains of Riverina Proper mark a straight sky-line, broken here and there by a monumental clump or pine-ridge. And away beyond the horizon, southward still, the geodesic curve carries that monotony across the zone of salt-bush, myall, and swamp box; across the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee, and on to the Victorian border--say, two hundred and fifty miles.  Just about mid-day, the station track I was following intersected and joined the stock route; and against the background of a pine-ridge, a mile ahead, I saw some wool-teams.  When I overtook them, they had stopped for dinner among the trees.  One of the party was an intimate friend of mine, and three others were acquaintances; so, without any of the ceremony which prevails in more refined circles, I hooked Fancy's rein on a pine branch, pulled the pack-saddle off Bunyip, and sat down with the rest, to screen the tea through my teeth and flick the diligent little operatives out of the cold mutton with the point of my pocket-knife.  There were five bullock-teams altogether:  Thompson's twenty; Cooper's eighteen; Dixon's eighteen; and Price's two teams of fourteen each. Three of the wagons, in accordance with a fashion of the day, bore names painted along the board inside the guard irons.  Thompson's was the Wanderer; Cooper's, the Hawkesbury; and Dixon's, the Wombat. All were platform wagons, except Cooper's, which was the Sydney-side pattern.  To avoid the vulgarity of ushering this company into the presence of the punctilious reader without even the ceremony of a Bedouin introduction--(This is my friend, N or M; if he steals anything, I will be responsible for it):  a form of introduction, by the way, too sweeping in its suretyship for prudent men to use in Riverina--I shall describe the group, severally, with such succinctness as may be compatible with my somewhat discursive style.  Steve Thompson was a Victorian.  He was scarcely a typical bullock driver, since fifteen years of that occupation had not brutalised his temper, nor ensanguined his vocabulary, nor frayed the terminal \"g\" from his participles.  I knew him well, for we had been partners in dogflesh and colleagues in larceny when we were, as poets feign, nearer to heaven than in maturer life.  And, wide as Riverina is, we often encountered fortuitously, and were always glad to fraternise.  Physically, Thompson was tall and lazy, as bullock drivers ought to be.  Cooper was an entire stranger to me, but as he stoutly contended that Hay and Deniliquin were in Port Phillip, I inferred him to be a citizen of the mother colony.  Four months before, he had happened to strike the very first consignment of goods delivered at Nyngan by rail, for the Western country.  He had chanced seven tons of this, for Kenilworth; had there met Thompson, delivering salt from Hay; and now the two, freighted with Kenilworth wool, were making the trip to Hay together. Kenilworth was on the commercial divide, having a choice of two evils--the long, uninviting track southward to the Murrumbidgee, and the badly watered route eastward to the Bogan.  This was Cooper's first experience of Riverina, and he swore in no apprentice style that it would be his last. A correlative proof of the honest fellow's Eastern extraction lay in the fact that he was three inches taller, three stone heavier, and thirty degrees lazier, than Thompson.  I had known Dixon for many years.  He was a magnificent specimen of crude humanity; strong, lithe, graceful, and not too big--just such a man as your novelist would picture as the nurse-swapped offspring of some rotund or ricketty aristocrat.  But being, for my own part, as I plainly stated at the outset, incapable of such romancing, I must register Dixon as one whose ignoble blood had crept through scoundrels since the Flood.  Though, when you come to look at it leisurely, this wouldn't interfere with aristocratic, or even regal, descent--rather the reverse.  Old Price had carted goods from Melbourne to Bendigo in '52; a hundred miles, for ≈Å100 per ton.  He had had two teams at that time, and, being a man of prudence and sagacity, had two teams still, and was able to pay his way.  I had known him since I was about the height of this table; he was Old Price then; he is Old Price still; and he will probably be Old Price when my head is dredged with the white flour of a blameless life, and I am pottering about with a stick, hating young fellows, and making myself generally disagreeable. Price's second team was driven by his son Mosey, a tight little fellow, whose body was about five-and-twenty, but whose head, according to the ancient adage, had worn out many a good pair of shoulders.  Willoughby, who was travelling loose with Thompson and Cooper, was a whaler. Not owing to any inherent incapacity, for he had taken his B.A. at an English university, and was, notwithstanding his rags and dirt, a remarkably fine-looking man; bearing a striking resemblance to Dixon, even in features.  But as the wives of Napoleon's generals could never learn to walk on a carpet, so the aimless popinjay of adult age can never learn to take a man's place among rough-and-ready workers.  Even in spite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],["title","Such Is Life (#1)"],["body"," Willoughby's personal resemblance to Dixon, there was a suggestion of latent physical force and leathery durability in the bullock driver, altogether lacking in the whaler, and equiponderated only by a certain air of refinement.  How could it be otherwise?   Willoughby, of course, had no horse--in fact, like Bassanio, all the wealth he had ran in his veins; he was a gentleman.  Well for the world if all representatives of his Order were as harmless, as inexpensive, and as unobtrusive as this poor fellow, now situated like that most capricious poet, honest Ovid, among the Goths.  One generally feels a sort of diffidence in introducing one's self; but I may remark that I was at that time a Government official, of the ninth class; paid rather according to my grade than my merit, and not by any means in proportion to the loafing I had to do. Candidly, I was only a Deputy-Assistant-Sub-Inspector, but with the reversion of the Assistant-Sub-Inspectorship itself when it should please Atropos to snip the thread of my superior officer.  The repast being concluded, the drivers went into committee on the subject of grass--a vital question in '83, as you may remember.  \"It's this way,\" said Mosey imperatively, and deftly weaving into his address the thin red line of puissant adjective; \"You dunno what you're doin' when you're foolin' with this run.  She's hair-trigger at the best o' times, an' she's on full cock this year.  Best watched station on the track. It's risk whatever way you take it.  We're middlin' safe to be collared in the selection, an' we're jist as safe to be collared in the ram-paddick. Choice between the divil an' the dam.  An' there's too big a township o' wagons together.  Two's enough, an' three's a glutton, for sich a season as this.\"  \"I think Cooper and I had better push on to the ram-paddock,\" suggested Thompson.  \"You three can work on the selection. Division of labour's the secret of success, they say.\"  \"Secret of England's greatness,\" mused Dixon.  \"I forgit what the (irrelevant expletive) that is.\"  \"The true secret of England's greatness lies in her dependencies, Mr. Dixon,\" replied Willoughby handsomely; and straightway the serene, appreciative expression of the bullock driver's face, rightly interpreted, showed that his mind was engaged in a Graeco-Roman conflict with the polysyllable, the latter being uppermost.  \"Well, no,\" said Mosey, replying to Thompson; \"no use separatin' now; it's on'y spreadin' the risk; we should 'a' separated yesterday. I would n't misdoubt the selection, on'y Cunningham told me the other day, Magomery's shiftin' somebody to live there.  If that's so, it's up a tree, straight.  The ram-paddick's always a risk--too near the station.\"  \"The hut on the selection was empty a week ago,\" I remarked. \"I know it, for I camped there one night.\"  \"Good grass?\" inquired a chorus of voices.  \"About the best I've had this season.\"  \"We'll chance the selection,\" said Mosey decidedly.  \"Somebody can ride on ahead, an' see the coast clear.  But they won't watch a bit of a paddick in the thick o' the shearin', when there's nobody livin' in it.\"  \"Squatters hed orter fine grass f'r wool teams, an' glad o' the chance,\" observed Price, with unprintable emphasis.  \"Lot of sense in that remark,\" commented Mosey, with a similar potency of adjective.  \"Well, this is about the last place God made,\" growled Cooper, the crimson thread of kinship running conspicuously through his observation, notwithstanding its narrow provinciality.  \"Roll up, Port Phillipers! the Sydney man's goin' to strike a match!\" retorted Mosey.  \"I wonder what fetched a feller like you on-to bad startin'-ground.  I swear we did n't want no lessons.\"  Cooper was too lazy to reply; and we smoked dreamily, while my kangaroo dog silently abstracted a boiled leg of mutton from Price's tuckerbox, and carried it out of sight.  By-and-by, all eyes converged on a shapeless streak which had moved into sight in the restless, glassy glitter of the plain, about a mile away.  \"Warrigal Alf going out on the lower track,\" remarked Thompson, at length. \"He was coming behind Baxter and Donovan yesterday, but he stopped opposite the station, talking to Montgomery and Martin, and the other fellows lost the run of him.  I wonder where he camped last night? He ought to be able to tell us where the safest grass is, considering he's had a load in from the station.  But to tell you the truth, I'm in favour of the ram-paddock.  If we're caught there, we'll most likely only get insulted--and we can stand a lot of that--but if we're caught in the selection, it's about seven years.  Then we can make the Lignum Swamp to-morrow from the ram-paddock, and we can't make it from the selection. So I think we better be moving; it'll be dark enough before we unyoke. I've worked on that ram-paddock so often that I seem to have a sort of title to it.\"  \"But there's lots o' changes since you was here last,\" said Mosey. \"Magomery he's beginnin' to think he's got a sort o' title to the ram-paddick now, considerin' it's all purchased.  Tell you what I'll do: I'll slip over in two minits on Valiparaiser, an' consult with Alf. Me an' him's as thick as thieves.\"  \"I'll go with you, Mosey,\" said I.  \"I've got some messages for him. Keep an eye on my dog, Steve.\"  Mosey untied the fine upstanding grey horse from the rear of his wagon; I hitched Bunyip to a tree, and mounted Fancy, and we cantered away together across the plain; the ponderous empty wagon--Sydney-side pattern--with eight bullocks in yoke and twelve travelling loose, coming more clearly into detail through the vibrating translucence of the lower atmosphere. Alf did n't deign to stop.  I noticed a sinister smile on his sad, stern face as Mosey gaily accosted him.  \"An' how's the world usin' you, Alf?  Got red o' Pilot, I notice. Ever see sich a suck-in?  Best at a distance, ain't he?  Tell you what I come over for, Alf:  They say things is middlin' hot here on Runnymede; an' we're in a (sheol) of a (adjective) stink about what to do with our frames to-night.  Our wagons is over there on the other track, among the pines. Where did you stop las' night?  Your carrion's as full as ticks.\"  \"I had them in the selection; took them out this morning after they lay down.\"  \"Good shot!\"  \"Why, I don't see how it concerns you.\"  \"The selection's reasonable safe--ain't it?\"  \"Please yourself about that.\"  \"Is the ram-paddick safe?\".  \"No.\"  \"Is there enough water in the tank at the selection?\"  \"How do I know?  There was enough for me.\"  \"I say, Alf,\" said I:  \"Styles, of Karowra, told me to let you know, if possible, that you were right about the boring rods; and he'll settle with you any time you call.  Also there's a letter for you at Lochleven Station.  Two items.\"  \"I'm very much obliged to you for your trouble, Collins,\" replied Alf, with a shade less of moroseness in his tone.  \"Well, take care o' yourself, ole son; you ain't always got me to look after you,\" said Mosey pleasantly; and we turned our horses and rode away.  \"Evil-natured beggar, that,\" he continued. \"He's floggin' the cat now, 'cos he laid us on to the selection in spite of his self.  If that feller don't go to the bottomless for his disagreeableness, there's somethin' radic'ly wrong about Providence. I'm a great believer in Providence, myself, Tom; an' what's more, I try to live up to my (adj.) religion.  I'm sure I don't want to see any pore (fellow) chained up in fire an' brimstone for millions o' millions o' years, an' a worm tormentin' him besides; but I don't see what the (adj.  sheol) else they can do with Alf.  Awful to think of it.\" Mosey sighed piously, then resumed, \"Grand dog you got since I seen you last. Found the (animal), I s'pose?\"  \"No, Mosey.  Bought him fair.\"  \"Jist so, jist so.  You ought to give him to me.  He's bound to pick up a bait with you; you're sich a careless &c., &c.\" And so the conversation ran on the subject of dogs during the return ride.  On our reaching the wagons, it was unanimously resolved that the selection should be patronised.  This being so, there was no hurry--rather the reverse-- for the selection was not to be reached till dusk.  You will understand that the bullock drivers' choice of accommodation lay between the selection, the ram-paddock, and a perisher on the plain. The selection was four or five miles ahead; the near corner of the ram-paddock about two miles farther still; whilst a perisher on the plain is seldom hard to find in a bad season, when the country is stocked for good seasons. Runnymede home station--Mooney and Montgomery, owners; J.  G.  Montgomery, managing partner--was a mile or so beyond the further corner of the ram-paddock, and was the central source of danger.  Presently the tea leaves were thrown out of the billies; the tuckerboxes were packed on the pole-fetchels; and the teams got under way. Thompson pressed me to camp with him and Cooper for the night, and I readily consented; thus temporarily eluding a fatality which was in the habit of driving me from any given direction to Runnymede homestead-- a fatality which, I trust, I shall have no farther occasion to notice in these pages.  We therefore tied Fancy beside Thompson's horse at the rear of his wagon, and disposed Bunyip's pack-saddle and load on the top of the wool; the horse, of course, following Fancy according to his daily habit.  A quarter of a mile of stiff pulling through the sand of the pine-ridge, and the plain opened out again.  A short, dark, irregular line, cleanly separated from the horizon by the wavy glassiness of the lower air, indicated the clump of box on the selection, four miles ahead; and this comprised the landscape.  Soon we became aware of two teams coming to meet us; then three horsemen behind, emerging from the pine-ridge we had left.  As the horsemen gradually decreased their distance, the teams met and passed us without salutation; sullenly drawing off the track, in the deference"]]]
