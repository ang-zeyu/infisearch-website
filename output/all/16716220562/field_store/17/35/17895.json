I don't see why you can't tie mine for me!\"  \"Well, you know what Father said,\" Taro answered. \"He said you are a girl and must mind me. You get Mother to do it.\"  \"He said you should be kind and noble, too,\" said Take. \"It would be kind and noble of you to tie my sash, because I'm just suffering to have it tied.\" She looked at him sidewise. \"Please do,\" she said.  Taro thought it over. Then he said, \"Well, come behind the lantern, and just this once I'll do it. But don't you tell, and don't you ask me to again.\"  \"Cross my heart, Taro,\" Take promised. \"I won't tell. You are a good, kind boy.\"  Taro tied the sash the best he could, but it looked very queer. It looked so queer that when, after a while, their Mother saw it she said, \"Come here, my child; your sash is tied upside down! But I know it is hard to reach behind you. I must teach you how to make a nice big bow all by yourself.\" And Take never told her that Taro did it. No one ever knew it until this minute!  When they were all dressed, the Twins ran out into the garden.  There had been a shower in the night, and the leaves were all shiny, they had been washed so clean by the rain. The dew sparkled on the green iris leaves beside the tiny river, and the sunshine made the fish look like lumps of living gold in the blue waters of the little lake. The birds were singing in the wistaria vine that grew over the porch, and two doves were cooing on the old stone lantern that stood by the little lake. They were Taro's pet doves.  Taro held out his fingers. \"I haven't forgotten to bring you something,\" he called.  The doves flew down and lit upon his shoulders. Taro took a few rice kernels from the sleeve of his kimono--which he used as a pocket--and fed the birds from his hand. They were so tame they even picked some from his lips.  \"I will feed the fish too,\" Take said. And she ran to the kitchen where the maids were preparing breakfast. She came back with some white rice wafers in her fingers. First she threw some tiny bits of the wafer into the water. The fish saw them and came to the surface. Then Take reached down and held the wafer in her fingers. The little fish came all about her hand and nibbled the wafer without fear. One of them even nibbled her finger!  Take laughed. \"Mind your manners,\" she said to the little fish. \"It's not polite to try to eat me up when I'm feeding you! I'm not your breakfast, anyway!\"  Just then they heard the tinkling sound of a little gong.  \"Ting--ting--ting!\" sang Take to the sound of the gong. \"Breakfast is ready.\" And she danced up the gravel walk to the house, her hair bobbing up and down, and her sash flying in the wind, so that she looked like a big blue butterfly.  Taro came too, and they sat down on mats in the kitchen, to eat their breakfast.  Their Mother was already serving their Father's breakfast to him in the next room. By and by she and Grandmother would have their breakfast with the servants.  This is a picture of the Twins eating their breakfast.  They each had a tiny table of red lacquered wood. On each table were two bowls. In one bowl was soup, and in the other rice.  Taro took up his soup-bowl with both hands. He was in a hurry.  \"Oh, Taro!\" Take said. \"What would Mother say! You must be more polite. You know that isn't the way to hold your bowl.\"  Taro set his bowl down again, and took it up carefully with one hand, just as you see him in the picture.  Take began to eat her rice. She had two little sticks in her right hand. She used these sticks instead of a fork or spoon.  But Take was in a hurry too. She spilled a little rice on the front of her kimono.  Taro saw it. \"You're just as impolite as I am,\" he said. \"It's just as bad to spill as it is to hold your bowl wrong.\"  \"Oh, dear me! Then we're both impolite,\" said Take. \"What would Mother say!\"  \"She'd be ashamed of us,\" said Taro.  \"Let's see if we can't remember every single one of our manners after this,\" said Take.  Just as they were finishing their rice there came the sound of steps--Clumpity--clumpity-clump!  \"Who's coming?\" said Taro.  \"I think it's the hairdresser,\" Take answered.  She ran out to see. An old woman was on the porch. She had just slipped off her clogs.  In Japan no one thinks of such a thing as wearing street shoes in the house. It would bring in dirt and soil the pretty white mats. That was why she took them off.  Take bowed to the old woman. \"Oha-yo?\" she said politely.  \"Oha-yo?\" said the old woman to Take.  The Twins' Mother heard them. She came to the door. She bowed to the old woman, and the old woman bowed to her.  \"Come in,\" said the Mother. \"I hope you will make my hair look very nice to-day, because we are going to the Temple.\"  The old woman smiled. \"I will make it shine like satin,\" she said.  The Mother got out her little mirror and sat down on the floor. The hairdresser stood behind her and began to take down the Mother's long black hair.  Bot'Chan had been awake a long time. Taro was playing with him on the floor.  The Mother called Take. \"Daughter,\" she said, \"a little nap would make our baby wide awake and happy when we start for the Temple. Would you like to put him to sleep?\"  Take loved to put Bot'Chan to sleep better than anything else in the world. She took him in her arms and hugged him close. Then she swayed back and forth, and sang this little song:    \"How big and beautiful Sir Baby Boy is growing.   \"When he becomes a good boy, too, then I will make our  garden larger, and build a little treasure house for  him.   \"Next to the treasure-house I will plant pine trees.  Next to the pine trees I will plant bamboo. Next to the  bamboo I will plant plum trees.   \"To the branches of the plum trees shall be hung little  bells! When those little bells ring, O Sir Baby Boy, how  happy you will be!\"   (Adapted from translation by Sir Edwin Arnold.)   She sang over and over, and softer and softer, about the little bells; and by the time the hairdresser had finished the Mother's hair and gone away, Bot'Chan was fast asleep.  Then Natsu put him down on some soft mats, and combed Take's hair.  Take stood still, like a brave little girl, though there were three snarls in it, and Natsu pulled dreadfully!  When every one was ready to go, they looked very splendid indeed. They all wore kimonos of the finest silk, with the family crest embroidered on the back and left sleeve. And Bot'Chan had new clothes that Grannie and Mother had made especially for him to wear on his first visit to the Temple.  When everybody else was dressed and ready, Natsu waked Bot'Chan and put his new clothes on him.  \"Now, we can start,\" said the Mother.  She took Bot'Chan in her arms. Natsu slid open the door, and they all stepped out on the porch.     HOW THEY WENT TO THE TEMPLE  HOW THEY WENT TO THE TEMPLE   THE Twins were just stepping into their clogs when the front gate opened, and what do you think they saw! In came trotting three brown men, each one pulling a little carriage behind him! They came right up to the porch. Take was just standing on one foot, ready to slip her other one into the strap of her clog, when they came in. She was so surprised she fell right over backward! She picked herself up again quickly, and hopped along, with one shoe on and one shoe off:  \"Are we going to ride?\" she gasped.  Her Father laughed. \"Yes, little pop-eyes,\" he said; \"we are going to ride to the Temple, and you and Taro shall ride in one rickshaw all by yourselves.\"  The name of these little carriages drawn by men instead of horses is \"jinrickshas,\" but he called them \"rickshaws\" for short.  The Twins were so happy they could hardly keep still. They looked at all three rickshaws and all three men, and then they said to their Father:  \"May we ride in this one?\"  It had red wheels.  \"Yes, you may ride in that one,\" he said.  Then he got into the one with green wheels, and rode away.  Mother and Grannie and the Baby got into the next one, and their rickshaw man trotted away after Father.  \"Keep close behind us,\" the Mother called back to the Twins.  They got into the rickshaw with the red wheels, and away they flew.  The Twins had never been in a rickshaw alone before in all their lives. They sat up very straight, and held on tight because it bounced a good deal, and the rickshaw man could run very fast.  \"I feel as grand as a princess,\" Take whispered to Taro. \"How do you feel?\"  \"I feel like a son of the Samurai,\" Taro whispered back. That was the proudest feeling he could think of.  There were so very many interesting things to see that the Twins didn't talk much for a while. You see, it's hard work to use your mouth and your eyes and your ears all at once. So the Twins just used their eyes.  It was still quite early in the morning when they reached the city streets. Here they saw men with baskets hung from poles going from house to house. Some were selling vegetables, some had fish, and others were selling flowers, or brooms.  They saw little girls with baby brothers on their backs, skipping rope or bouncing balls. The baby's head wobbled dreadfully when his little sister skipped, but he didn't cry about it. He just let it wobble!  The Twins rode by fruit-shops, and clothing-shops with gay kimonos flapping in the breeze; by little shops where people were making paper lanterns, by tea-shops and silk-shops, by houses and gardens in strange places they had never seen before.  They saw an old priest going from door to door, holding out his bowl for money.  In one street carpenters were putting up a new house, and once they caught a glimpse of the very bridge that leads to the Emperor's palace.  By and by they reached the gate of the Temple grounds. All the rickshaws stopped here, and everybody got out.  The Mother put Bot'Chan on her back, and they all started in a procession"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3496"],["title","The Japanese Twins (#4)"],["body","the Temple. First walked the Father, looking very proud. Then came the Twins, looking quite proud, too. Then came Mother and Grannie and Bot'Chan and they looked proudest of all!  When they got inside the gate, the Twins thought they were in fairyland. You would have thought so, too, if you could have been there with them.  They saw so many wonderful things that day that if I were to tell you about every one of them it would fill up this whole book!  First of all, they came into a broad roadway with beautiful great cedar trees on each side. Under these trees were little booths. Great paper lanterns and banners of all colors hung in front of the booths; and when they waved gayly in the wind, the place looked like a giant flower-garden in full bloom.  Near the Temple entrance was a great stone trough full of clear water. There was a long-handled wooden dipper floating on it.  \"Come here,\" said the Father.  The Twins, Grandmother, and Mother, with Baby on her back, all came at once and stood in a row beside the trough. They put out their hands. The Father took the dipper and poured water on their hands.  When their hands were quite clean, they rinsed their mouths, too. Then they entered the Temple vestibule.  There were more little booths in the Temple vestibule, and there were so many people, big and little, crowding about that the Father took the Twins' hands so they wouldn't get lost.  First he led them to a place where they bought some cooked peas on a little plate, and some rice. He gave the peas to Taro and some of the rice to Take.  The Twins wondered what in the world their Father wanted with peas and rice. They soon found out. In the very next place was a little stall, and in the little stall was a tiny, tiny white horse--no bigger than a big dog! Even its eyes were white.  \"Oh, Father,\" the Twins said, both together, \"whose little horse is it?\"  \"It's Kwannon's little horse,\" the Father said. \"Taro, you may give him the peas.\"  Taro held out the plate. The little white pony put his nose in the plate and ate them all up! He sniffed up Taro's sleeve as if he wanted more.  Take patted his back. \"Who is Kwannon?\" she asked.  \"Kwannon is a beautiful goddess who loves little children,\" said the Father.  \"Does she live here?\" asked Taro.  \"This is her Temple, where people come to worship,\" the Father answered. \"We are going to pray to her to-day to take good care of Bot'Chan always.\"  \"Did you ask her to take care of us, too?\" asked Take.  \"Yes; we brought you both here when you were a month old, just as we are bringing Bot'Chan now,\" the Father replied.  \"Does she take care of all little children?\" Take said.  \"She loves them all, and takes care of all who ask for her protection.\"  \"My!\" said Take. \"She must have her hands full with such a large family!\"  Her Father laughed, \"But, you see, she has a great many hands,\" he said. \"If she had only two, like us, it would be hard for her to take care of so many.\"  \"I never saw her take care of me,\" said Taro.  \"We do not see the gods,\" their Father answered. \"But we must worship and obey them just the same.\"  \"I think Kwannon must love little children,\" said Take, \"because she wants them to have such good times in her Temple.\"  They said good-bye to the little horse, and walked through an opening into a courtyard beyond. The moment they stepped into the courtyard a flock of white pigeons flew down and settled all about them.  \"Take may feed the pigeons,\" the Father said. \"They are Kwannon's pigeons.\"  Take threw her rice on the ground. The pigeons picked it all up. So many people fed them that they were almost too fat to fly!  At another booth their Father bought some little rings of perfumed incense. He put them in his sleeve. His sleeves could hold more things than all a boy's pockets put together!  When they reached the great door of the Temple itself, the Father said: \"Now, we must take off our shoes.\" So they all slipped their toes out of their clogs, and went into the Temple just as the bell in the courtyard rang out with a great--boom-- BOOM--BOOM! that made the air shiver and shake all about them.  The Temple was one big, shadowy room, with tall red columns all about.  \"It's just like a great forest full of trees, isn't it?\" Taro whispered to Take, as they went in.  \"It almost scares me,\" Take whispered back; \"it's so big.\"  Directly in front of the entrance there was another bell. A long red streamer hung from its clapper, and under it was a great box with bars over the top. On the box there perched a great white rooster!  The Father pulled the red streamer and rang the bell. Then he threw a piece of money into the box. It fell with a great noise.  \"Cock-a-doodle-doo,\" crowed the rooster! He seemed very much pleased about the money, though it was meant for the priests and not for him. \"The rooster is saying thank you,\" cried Take. \"Hush,\" said her Mother.  Then the Father drew from his sleeve a little rosary of beads. He placed it over his hands, and bowed his head in prayer while Grannie and Mother and Baby and the Twins stood near him and kept very still. When he had finished, a priest came up.  The Father bowed to the priest. \"Will you show us the way to the shrine of Kwannon?\" he asked.  Away off at the farther end of the Temple, the Twins could see a great altar. Banners and lanterns hung about it, and people were kneeling on the floor before it, praying. Before the altar was an open brazier with incense burning in it.  \"Come this way,\" said the priest. He led them to the altar.  The Father took Bot'Chan from his Mother, and held him in his arms. The priest said a prayer to Kwannon, and blessed the Baby. Then the Father threw incense rings on the little fire that burned in the brazier before the altar. Wreaths of smoke began to curl about their heads. The air was filled with the sweet odor of it. Some of it went up Bot'Chan's nose. It smarted. Bot'Chan didn't like it. He had behaved beautifully up to that time, and I am sure if the incense hadn't gone up his nose he would have kept on behaving beautifully. But it did, and Bot'Chan sneezed just as the priest finished the prayer.  Then he gave a great scream. Then another, and another. Three of them!  The priest smiled. But the Father didn't smile. He gave Bot'Chan back to his mother just as quickly as he could.  He said, \"The honorable worshippers will be disturbed. We must go out at once.\"  They hurried back to the entrance and found their clogs, and the moment they were outdoors again, in the sweet, fresh air, Bot'Chan cuddled down on his Mother's back and went to sleep without another sound.  Near the Temple they found an orchard of cherry trees in full bloom. People were sitting under the cherry trees, looking at the blossoms. Some of them were writing little verses, which they hung on the branches of the trees. They did this because they loved the blossoms so much. Children were playing all about. Near by was a pretty little tea-house.  Grannie saw it first. \"I am thirsty,\" she said.  \"So am I,\" said Take.  \"So am I,\" said Taro.  \"We're all thirsty,\" the Father said.  Outside the tea-house, under the trees there were wooden benches. They sat down on these, and soon little maids from the tea-house brought them trays with tea and sweet rice-cakes.  They sat on the benches and sipped their tea, and watched the people moving about, and looked up at the cherry blossoms against the blue sky, and were very happy, indeed.  The Mother had carried Bot'Chan all the way on her back, so maybe she was a little tired. Anyway, she said to the Father:--  \"If you and the Twins want to go farther, let Grannie and me stay here and rest. You can come back for us.\"  \"Would you like to see the animals?\" the Father asked the Twins.  Taro and Take jumped right up, and took their Father's hands, one on each side, and then they all walked away together under the blossoming trees to another part of the park.  In this part of the park there were cages, and in the cages were lions, and tigers, and monkeys, and zebras, and elephants, and all kinds of animals! There were birds, too, with red and blue plumage and beautiful golden tails. There were parrots and cockatoos and pheasants. Wild ducks were swimming in the ponds; and two swans sailed, like lovely white ships, to the place where the Twins stood, and opened their bills to be fed.  In the Father's sleeve was something for each one. Taro and Take took turns. Take fed the swans, and Taro fed the great fish that swam up beside them and looked at them with round eyes. When they saw the food the fish leaped in the water and fought each other to get it, and when they ate it they made curious noises like pigs.  \"I don't think they have very good manners,\" said Take.  By and by they came to a queer little street. This little street must have been made on purpose for little boys and girls to have fun in, for there were all sorts of astonishing things there. There were jugglers doing strange tricks with tops and swords. There were acrobats, and candy-sellers and toy-sellers going about with baskets hung from long poles over their shoulders. It was almost like a circus.  The street was full of people, and every one was gay. The Twins and their Father had gone only a little way up the street when an old woman met them. She had a pole on her shoulder, and from it swung a little fire of coals in a brazier. She had a little pot of batter and a little jar of sweet sauce, a ladle, a griddle, and a cake-turner!  \"Would you like to make some cakes?\" she said to Take.  Take clasped her hands. \"Oh, Father, may I?\" she said.  The Father gave the old woman some money out of his sleeve. She set the brazier on the ground.  Then Take tucked her sleeves back, put the griddle on the coals, poured out some batter, and cooked a little cake on one side until it was brown. Then she turned it over with the cake-turner, and browned it on the other side. Then she put it on a plate and put the sauce on it."]]]
