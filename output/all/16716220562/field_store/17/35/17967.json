Three of the best hats the boys had were lost in the fire and rapids.  We were now at the junction of the Green and Grand Rivers. The walls on the west side are 1,800 feet high, where the rivers come together in a V shape.  Now our trouble begins, and plenty of bad rapids in the river.  Dunn was the one who took the altitudes with the barometer and it was here we had the first real trouble in the party, although Powell had named Dunn the \"Dirty Devil.\"  But the rest of the boys looked over that.  At noon, while we were making a portage and letting the boats over a bad place, the ropes happened to catch Bill Dunn under the arms and came near drowning him, but he managed to catch the ropes and come out.  While we were eating our dinner Sumner said that Dunn came near being drowned and the Major's brother made the remark that it would have been but little loss, and the Major spoke up and said that Dunn would have to pay thirty dollars for a watch belonging to him that had been soaked with water and ruined, and if he did not he would have to leave the party.  Andy Hall and I were down at our boat, I having gone down after a cup and Andy had remained at the boat fitting one of his oars.  When we returned to where they were eating Sumner asked me what I thought of the Major's proposition, and I asked him what it was, and he then related what had been said.  I asked the Major if that was his desire and he said that it was.  I made the remark that a part of his wishes could not be granted, as it was impossible to get out of the Canyon on account of the abrupt walls.  He then said that it made no difference whether Dunn got out or not.  I then said that I was sorry that Dunn had been jerked into the water and got the watch wet, and that I was sorry he felt that way with one of his party, and the Major seemed to be offended at my remarks and said I had no right to pass on the matter.  Also that neither Hall nor myself, in the future of the party, would be expected to say anything, as we were too young.  Hall made the remark that we had old heads on our shoulders anyway.  Before this time everything seemed to be getting along fine, as each man had a certain task, or a certain thing to do, and I was doing the cooking, and I generally found plenty to do.  Our meal was ready and we all seated ourselves on the rocks to eat our dinner.  Up to this time I had always helped the Major all I could and washed his hand (as he only had one) and generally found him a good place to sit at meals, sometimes a few feet from the rest.  But before this it never made any difference to me, but now it did, for, as Andy Hall would say, he raised hell with himself in the break he had made with Dunn.  I could see that there was a different feeling in the whole party at this time and the Major had sat down several feet from the rest of the party.  I poured out each man a cup of coffee and one for him also and we all began to eat.  He then asked me why I did not bring him his dinner as I had been doing before and I told him he had just said that he was going to make a change in the outfit and I told him that I had made that change to start the ball rolling, and that he would have to come and get his grub like the rest of the boys.  His brother then handed his dinner to him.  After dinner Sumner asked him if he had changed his mind in regard to Dunn and the watch and he said he had not and that Dunn would either pay for the watch or leave the party.  Dunn, Hall, Bradley and myself were near the cook boat and about twenty feet from the Major and Sumner.  We could not hear what they were talking about, but we had decided that if Dunn left the party we would go with him.  Of course, we expected opposition to what we intended to do, so after we had talked the matter over we wanted Bradley to go and tell the Major what we intended to do.  But Bradley decided I had better go and tell him myself, as I had made the plan of going with Dunn.  I went to where Sumner and the Major were talking, and the two Rowland boys were with them.  I told the Major that Bradley, Hall and myself had decided to go with Dunn and that we would take my boat (the cook boat) and some grub, and we would pull out, and he could come when he got ready.  He said he would not stand any such work, that it would be the ruin of his party.  I told him that it was all his own fault and that I had no more talk to make and went back to the boat.  I found Dunn, Bradley and Hall waiting to see what had happened, but before I had time to tell them, Sumner came and began to talk to us, telling us to not feel put out, that the Major was hasty and to give him another chance.  Dunn said that the Major never did like him anyway, if he had he would never have named the Eskalanty[1] River dirty devil.  We camped at that place for the night and in the morning the Major said he would take thirty dollars for the watch and that he could pay for it when we got through.  None of the party except the Major liked Capt. Powell.  He had a bulldozing way that was not then practiced in the west.  He threatened to slap me several times for trying to sing like he did, but he never did slap anyone in the party. We all moved off down the river all O.K., but our provisions began to run short, rapids became more often, some of them very bad, but for a few days everything went all right.  The boys would tell Indian adventures at night that someone had had, but the remark was made that Dunn had nothing to say and Captain Powell said he guessed Dunn did not know much about Indians.  The Major chipped in and said, nor anything else.  Sumner took it up for Dunn because he knew there would soon be trouble, and told Powell that Dunn had been wounded four times by the Comanchies, so it all passed off.  The next day we had some very bad rapids, so bad that it was necessary to let the boats around some large rocks, and in order to do this, and as Dunn was a fine swimmer, the Major asked him to swim out to a rock where he could catch the rope and raise it over the rock so the boat would swing in below.  He made the rock all O.K. and was ready to catch the rope which was supposed to be thrown to him, so he could swing the boat in below, but the Major saw his chance to drown Dunn, as we thought, and he held to the rope.  That was the first time that he had interfered in the letting the boats around bad places and the rope caught Dunn around the legs and pulled him into the current and came near loosing the boat.  But Dunn held on to the rope and finally stopped in water up to his hips.  We were all in the water but the Major and Captain Dunn told the Major that if he had not been a good swimmer he and the boat both would have been lost. The Major said as to Dunn that there would have been but little loss. One word brought on another, and the Major called Dunn a bad name and Dunn said that if the Major was not a cripple he would not be called such names.  Then Captain Powell said he was not crippled and started for Dunn with an oath, and the remark he would finish Dunn.  He had to pass right by me and I knew that he would soon drown Dunn, as he, so much larger, could easily do.  He was swearing and his eyes looked like fire and just as he passed I caught him by the hair of his head and pulled him over back into the water.  Howland saw us scuffling and he was afraid Cap would get hold of my legs, but Dunn got to me first and said, For God's sake, Bill, you will drown him.  By that time Howland was there and Cap had been in the water long enough and Dunn and Howland drug him out on the sand bar in the rocks.  After I got my hold in Cap's hair I was afraid to let go, for he was a very strong man.  He was up in a short time, and mad!  I guess he was mad!  He cursed me to everything, even to being a \"Missoury Puke.\"  I wasn't afraid of him when I got on dry ground; I could out-knock him after he was picked up twice.  He made for his gun and swore he would kill me and Dunn.  But this talk did not excite me and as he was taking his gun from the deck of the boat Andy Hall gave him a punch behind the ear and told him to put it back or off would go his head.  Cap looked around and saw who had the gun and he sure dropped his.  This all happened before the Major got around to where we were.  He soon took in the situation and came to me and made the remark that he would have never thought that I would go back on him.  I told him that he had gone back on himself and that he had better help Cap get the sand out of his eyes, that if he monkeyed with me any more I would keep him down next time.  Sumner and I had all we could do to keep down mutiny and there was bad feeling from that time on for a few days and we began to not recognize any authority from the Major.  We began to run races with our boats, as the loads were almost all gone.  It was fun for the first two days, but the water began to get rough.  Hall, Howland and myself were in my boat and I had become an expert in bad rapids and we ran several that the other two boats were let over with ropes.  We stopped at noon one day to wait for the other boats.  We were at the head of four bad rapids; it was some two hours before the other boats came and I had coffee all ready, as that was our principal food then.  We had but little flour, but had plenty of dried apples and coffee.  We laid in camp that afternoon and the Major and Sumner spent that afternoon in trying to find a place where we could let the boats over the first rapid with ropes.  But they failed to find any place where we could get footing enough and the walls were too high for our ropes, so the Major said we would try to find a place on the west side the next day.  That evening late Major and Sumner and the two Howland boys held a consultation (as I afterwards found out) to see about leaving the river with all hands."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35268"],["title","Adventures in the Canyons of the Colorado, (#4)"],["body","said we would cross over and leave our boats and instruments under some large rocks and that we then would go out to some Mormon settlements and get some grub and return to our boats and continue on down the river.  The Major asked me to bake up all the flour that we had and said to make the bread into bisquits, or dough-gods (as we called them), as flour and water was what we had to make them with.  In about three hours I had them all baked.  I told the Major that the bread was ready and he called the boys and told them all his intentions as to leaving the river.  That was the first time Hall and I knew anything about what was going on.  I told Hall to take our shares and put them in the boat, as the Major said that each man should keep his own part as we might get separated.  I told the Major that Hall and I had no intention of separating, and that Bradley, Hall and myself were going to stay with the river and go through or drown.  I also told him that if we had enough coming to us to pay for the boat that he could keep it.  Dunn, O. G. Howland and Seneca Howland had made up their minds to go and Dunn said he hated to leave Hall and myself, as we had been together a long time, and that we would perish in the river and that we had better come and stay with the party.  I told him that was what I was doing, that I called Hall, Bradley and myself a party of three and each one of them was a party of one.  While we were talking the Major came up to me and laid his left arm across my neck, tears running down his cheeks.  By that time the rest of the boys were present and the Major said to me, Bill, do you really mean what you say?  I told him that I did, and he said that if he had one man that would stay with him that he would not abandon the river, I just simply said that he did not know his party, and that Andy Hall and myself were too young to have any say in council and I said we are off now.  He said that it was near noon and if I would make some coffee that we would have a cup of coffee together.  I have been present at many solemn occasions, but I never witnessed one that come up to this. There were some strong hearts that shed tears.  Bradley said it made him a child again.  We crossed over to the west side of the river and there was where we left our instruments and one boat.  This is the last time we ever saw Dunn and the two Howland brothers alive.  Some years afterwards I, with a party of some others, buried their bones in the Shewitz Mountains, below Kanab wash.  As to Powell leaving the party at Lee's Ferry, there was no ferry on the river, no one except some Indians ever crossed.  There was no place known as Kanab wash when we first came down.  Powell never left the party until we got through to the mouth of the Virgin River, where he and his brother were taken to the railroad or stage by some Mormons who lived on the Muddy.  Sumner, Bradley, Hall and myself continued on down the river.  Hall and I stopped at Ehrenburg and Sumner and Bradley went on to Yuma.  From there Sumner went to Denver and Bradley to San Diego, where he died. Sumner died at Vernal, Utah, so I heard, and Hall was killed near Globe, Arizona.  Powell and his brother both died somewhere in the east and I am here nine miles below Phoenix.  W. W. HAWKINS.

THE STORY OF JAMES WHITE, THE FIRST MAN TO PASS THROUGH THE CANYONS OF THE COLORADO RIVER.   It seems to be a natural trait for any man, no matter how great, to claim to have been first in any great endeavor, dangerous exploration or unusual undertaking.  Hence it was to be expected that after Major Powell had made his memorable first trip down the Canyons of the Colorado that he and his friends should assert that his was the first expedition to attempt this hazardous undertaking.  Yet, while it may appear strange, an account appeared in the _Rocky Mountain Herald_ of the date of January 8, 1869, about five months before Major Powell started on his first expedition, giving circumstantial detail of the passage on a raft through the Canyons of the Colorado from the San Juan River, by a Wisconsin prospector, James White.  More dead than alive, he emerged from the lower reaches of the Canyon at Callville, a Mormon settlement, where he was cared for and nursed back to life.  Mr. White is still alive, a respected and honored old man, a citizen of Trinidad, Colorado, and while all the writers that have extolled Powell, from George Wharton James down to the Kolb Bros., have either abused or ignored White, there is a growing conviction that the old man's story was and is true and that he did actually make the journey.  A stalwart defender of White appeared in 1917 in the person of Mr. Thomas F. Dawson, who succeeded in having the Senate of the U. S. Congress publish an elaborate argument of some sixty-seven pages which he had prepared, entitled: \"The Grand Canyon--An article giving the credit of first traversing the Grand Canyon of the Colorado to James White, a Colorado gold prospector, who it is claimed made the voyage two years previous to the expedition under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell in 1869.\"  This pamphlet called forth a strong rejoinder from Robert Brewster Stanton, which occupied some twenty-two pages of \"The Trail,\" a monthly publication of the \"Sons of Colorado.\"  In it, this eminent engineer and writer, whose intimate knowledge of the Canyon none can dispute, while giving full credit to the honesty and integrity of Mr. White, still insists that he was unintentionally wrong in the main part of his statements.  On the other hand, F. S. Dellenbaugh, who has written two books on the Colorado River, viz., \"The Romance of the Colorado River\" and \"A Canyon Voyage,\" openly assails White as a mendacious fabricator of the worst type.  It would not be impossible for me, with my intimate personal knowledge of one portion of the Grand Canyon, extending over a period of nearly forty years, to point out discrepancies and inaccuracies in the published statements of both Stanton and Dellenbaugh, but it is not worth while here to do this.  Personally, I have come to believe White's statements, and here wish to reproduce in fac-simile a letter he wrote to his brother, dated Callville, September 26, 1867.  Owing to the imperfections in spelling, punctuation, etc., I give a rendition (made by Mr. Dawson) into correct English.  [Illustration: Fac-simile of first page of James White's letter to his brother.]  [Illustration: Fac-simile of second page of James White's letter, and the envelope in which it was sent to his brother.]  NAVIGATION OF THE BIG CANON  A TERRIBLE VOYAGE  Callville, September 26, 1867.  Dear brother:  It has been some time since I have heard from you.  I got no answer from the last letter I wrote you, for I left soon after I wrote.  I went prospecting with Captain Baker and George Stroll in the San Juan mountains.  We found very good prospects, but nothing that would pay. Then we started down the San Juan River.  We traveled down about 200 miles; then we crossed over on the Colorado and camped.  We laid over one day.  We found that we could not travel down the river, and our horses had sore feet.  We had made up our minds to turn back when we were attacked by fifteen or twenty Ute Indians.  They killed Baker, and George Stroll and myself took four ropes off our horses, an axe, ten pounds of flour and our guns.  We had fifteen miles to walk to the Colorado.  We got to the river just at night.  We built a raft that night.  We sailed all that night.  We had good sailing for three days; the fourth day George Stroll was washed off the raft and drowned, and that left me alone.  I thought that it would be my time next.  I then pulled off my pants and boots.  I then tied a rope to my waist.  I went over falls from ten to fifteen feet high.  My raft would tip over three or four times a day.  The third day we lost our flour, and for seven days I had nothing to eat except a raw-hide knife cover.  The eighth day I got some mesquite beans.  The thirteenth day I met a party of friendly Indians.  They would not give me anything to eat, so I gave them my pistol for the hind parts of a dog.  I had one of them for supper and the other for breakfast.  The sixteenth day I arrived at Callville, where I was taken care of by James Ferry.  I was ten days without pants or boots or hat.  I was sun-burnt so I could hardly walk. The Indians took seven head of horses from us.  I wish I could write you half I underwent.  I saw the hardest time that any man ever did in the world, but thank God that I got through it safe.  I am well again, and I hope these few lines will find you all well.  I send my best respects to all.  Josh, answer this when you get it.  Direct your letter to Callville, Arizona.  Ask Tom to answer that letter I wrote him several years ago.  JAMES WHITE.   Stanton claims that White only went through the lower part of the Canyon, viz., from the Grand Wash Cliff's to Callville.  This much he concedes, and he asserts that the evidence is clear that White was led to claim he had traveled the whole length of the Canyons, not through dishonesty, but by the law of suggestion.  The men with whom he talked, after he was rescued from the raft, knowing little or nothing of the Canyon, and assuming he had traveled the whole distance from the San Juan, made him believe he had so traveled.  When his terrible physical and mental condition is recalled, it is not hard to believe that he was in such a weakened state as readily to receive any powerful mental suggestion, and that this, once firmly fixed in his mind, ever afterwards appeared to him to be the strict and literal truth.  But this assertion of Stanton's implies that White and his companion, Stroll, after Captain Baker was killed, crossed the intervening hundreds of miles from the San Juan to the head of"]]]
