RAYMOND HALL   The pocket gophers of the species _Thomomys talpoides_ in east-central Colorado have long been referred to the subspecies _Thomomys talpoides clusius_ Coues with type locality at Bridger Pass, Wyoming. Recently, two subspecies, _T. t. attenuatus_ and _T. t. rostralis_ (see Hall and Montague, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 5(3):25-32, February 28, 1951) were named from along the Wyoming-Colorado boundary with the result that the populations of _Thomomys talpoides_ in east-central Colorado are separated from _T. t. clusius_ of Wyoming by the geographic ranges now ascribed to the recently named _T. t. attenuatus_ and _T. t. rostralis_. The subspecific identity of the animals from east-central Colorado thus is left in doubt. Examination of pertinent materials was made in the expectation that the names _Thomomys talpoides macrotis_ F. W. Miller (Proc. Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:41, December 14, 1930) and _Thomomys talpoides cheyennensis_ Swenk (Missouri Valley Fauna, 4:5, March 1, 1941) would apply to the specimens, the identity of which is in doubt. This examination discloses instead, as set forth in more detail below, that neither of the two names mentioned immediately above does apply; the Coloradan specimens in question are referable to an heretofore unrecognized subspecies which may be named and described as follows:            #Thomomys talpoides retrorsus# new subspecies        _Thomomys clusius_, Warren, The Mammals of Colorado,           G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, p. 80, 1910;           Cary, N. Amer. Fauna, 33:132, August 17, 1911.        _Thomomys talpoides clusius_, Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna,           39:100, November 15, 1915; F. W. Miller, Proc.           Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:41, December 14, 1930;           Warren, The Mammals of Colorado, Univ. Oklahoma           Press, Norman, p. 162, 1942.      _Type._--Male, subadult, skull and skin, No. 69840 Biological     Surveys Collection, U. S. Nat. Hist.; from Flagler, Kit Carson     County, Colorado; obtained on November 26, 1894, by Clark P.     Streator; original No. 4460.      _Range._--Western end of the Arkansas Divide in Colorado from     eight miles south of Seibert westward to Colorado Springs      _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see measurements); upper parts     grayish brown; underparts lighter; skull small; tympanic bullae     moderately inflated and angular anterolaterally; interpterygoid     space narrowly U-shaped; pterygoid hamuli without transverse     enlargement; nasals truncate posteriorly; premaxillary tongues     projecting posteriorly behind nasals for distance of     eight-tenths (0.5-1.1) of a millimeter.      _Comparisons._--In comparison with _T. t. fossor_ and _T. t.     rostralis_, which occur farther west, selected differences of     _T. t. retrorsus_ are: lighter color; larger skull; more     inflated tympanic bullae; greater relative (to length of skull)     breadth across upper incisors, rostrum, and zygomata. The     difference in color is greater in comparison with _fossor_ than     with _rostralis_.      In comparison with _T. t. macrotis_ (specimens from the type     locality), _T. t. retrorsus_ is indistinguishable in color,     length of tail, and length of tooth-row, but averages smaller in     all other measurements. There is no overlap in length of body,     basilar length, zygomatic breadth, mastoidal breadth or length     of nasals. The temporal ridges, which mark the limits of the     temporal muscles, are straight as opposed to curved and are     lower. The tympanic bullae are more angular anterolaterally in     _T. t. retrorsus_.      From _T. t. attenuatus_ to the north, _T. t. retrorsus_ differs     in darker (more brown) color, consistently longer body,     relatively (to length of skull) shorter rostrum and nasals.     Linear measurements of the two latter structures and length of     tail are approximately the same in the two subspecies but all     other measurements average more in _T. t. retrorsus_. Also in     the latter the temporal lines are approximately parallel instead     of being bowed outward in their middle extent and instead of     being more widely separated posteriorly than anteriorly.      From _T. t. cheyennensis_ to the northeast, _T. t. retrorsus_     differs in slightly darker (more brownish) color, consistently     shorter body and rostrum, usually a more narrowly V-shaped     interpterygoid space, and smaller average dimensions of the     skull, notably in mastoidal breadth and length of the rostrum.  _Remarks._--Miller's (Proc. Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:42, December 14, 1930) mention of a specimen taken on November 9, 1930, \"near the head of Beaver Creek in extreme northeastern Elbert County\" refers to the specimen, No. 2426 Colo. Mus. Nat. Hist., which is labeled as \"8 mi. N. E. Agate, Elbert Co., Colo.\" Specimens from Colorado Springs, in the collection of the late E. R. Warren, have not been examined but the fact that Cary, Warren 1942, and Bailey (see under synonymy above) each referred the specimens to _clusius_ instead of to the darker _fossor_ gives basis for tentatively referring the specimens to _T. t. retrorsus_.  Grateful acknowledgment is made to those persons in charge of the mammal collections of the Denver Museum of Natural History and the Biological Surveys collection of mammals in the United States National Museum for permission to examine and report upon the material listed below (see specimens examined). The study here reported upon was aided also by a contract between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy, and the University of Kansas (NR 161-791). Essential comparative materials were obtained with assistance from the Kansas University Endowment Association.      _Measurements._--Measurements of the type, a male, are followed     by the measurements of three adult females (69835, 69839 and     69838) from the type locality. Total length, 216, 207, 210, 200;     length of tail, 59, 58, 64, 56; length of hind foot, 28, 28, 28,     26; basilar length of skull, 32.8, 32.2, 32.3, 30.8; zygomatic     breadth, 23.1, 22.5, ----, 20.5; least interorbital breadth,     6.0, 6.7, 6.2, 6.1; mastoidal breadth, 18.2, 18.8, 17.7, 17.7;     length of nasals, 13.0, 13.7, 13.9, 14.0; breadth of rostrum,     7.6, 7.9, 7.4, 7.2; length of rostrum, 14.8, 15.6, 15.7, 16.0;     alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 7.6, 7.2, 7.7, 7.6.      _Specimens examined._--Total number, 13, all from Colorado, as     follows: _Elbert County_ (Colorado Mus.

[Illustration: Charge through an abattis.]     PREFATORY NOTE.   This volume, though historic, is not a history of the Rebellion, but a record of personal observations and experiences during the war, with an occasional look at affairs in general to give clearness to the narrative. The time has not arrived for the writing of an impartial history of the conflict between Slavery and Freedom in the United States. Reports of military operations are incomplete; documents in the archives at Washington are inaccessible; much material remains to be gathered before the patient historian can sift the wheat from the chaff. More than this, the war of ideas is not yet ended. Defeated Rebels in some parts of the South are bent on exterminating the African race. Few of those lately in rebellion plead guilty of having committed a crime; taking up arms against the government they consider to have been a blunder only. We are, therefore, too near the great events to render proper judgment upon questions in which our principles and sympathies have been enlisted.  The chapter concerning the Confederate Cotton Loan may seem to be out of place in a volume of which so large a portion is given to narrative, but I trust that it will be acceptable to the general reader, inasmuch as it reveals the efforts of the Rebels to array all Europe against the United States in the late struggle. The correspondence in my possession was picked up in the streets of Richmond, and will be of value to the future historian. The chapter in question is but an outline of the operations of the Confederates abroad.  In looking over the sheets as they came from the press, several errors relative to the organization and formation of troops in battle have been detected, which, however, will appear in but a few copies. Undoubtedly there are others, and the writer will esteem it a favor to be put right wherever he is in the wrong. Few official reports of regimental and brigade officers have been published, while the reports of division and corps commanders are only general in their statements. The true history of battles cannot be given till the history of regiments is written.  My stand-point as an observer is that of one whose instincts from early childhood have been on the side of Freedom. I have ever believed that Civil Liberty is the birthright of all men, and from the firing upon Sumter to the close of the contest had full faith that the people, under God, would subdue the Rebellion, and give freedom to the slave.  The four years have been worth a century of ordinary life; for in the mighty contest Right has triumphed over Wrong, and the human race, with a clearer perception of Truth and Justice as the sure foundation of government, is moving on to a higher civilization.
