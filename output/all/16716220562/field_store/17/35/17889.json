WEBB, J. KNOX JONES, JR., AND GEORGE W. BYERS  In 1954, two of us (Jones and Byers) collected reptiles and amphibians in Korea incidental to field studies relating to hemorrhagic fever. The 382 specimens thus obtained were deposited either in the Museum of Natural History of The University of Kansas (KU), or in the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan (UMMZ), and are the basis for the present report. Continuous American military operations of one sort or another in Korea since 1945 have afforded opportunities for interested persons to obtain there collections of amphibians and reptiles, the study of which has resulted in several recent publications (Babb, 1955; Dixon, 1956; Hahn, 1959 and 1960; Shannon, 1956 and 1957; Stewart, 1953 and 1954; Tanner, 1953; Walley, 1958_a_ and 1958_b_). This paper, which contains comments on the natural history and taxonomy of 22 species, all previously reported from Korea, supplements earlier studies, especially Shannon's (1956) annotated list of the herpetofauna of the country.  Shannon (_loc. cit._) recorded 36 kinds of reptiles and amphibians from Korea. Subsequently, _Bufo stejnegeri_ (previously omitted) was added by Shannon (1957), _Takydromus takydromoides oldi_ was described by Walley (1958_a_), and _Takydromus kwangakuensis_ was relegated to synonymy under _T. amurensis_ by Walley (1958_b_). Presently, then, 37 kinds are on record from the Korean Peninsula.  In the accounts beyond, Jones and Byers are mostly responsible for the remarks on natural history, whereas Webb is mostly responsible for the taxonomic comments. The synonymies include (1) the original description, which is followed by (2) the first use of the name-combination here employed if it differs from the name as originally proposed, and (3) any synonyms having type localities in Korea. All measurements are in millimeters and all dates refer to the year 1954 unless otherwise indicated. A gazetteer of localities mentioned in the text and a list of literature cited follow the accounts of species.  We are grateful to the officers, enlisted men and civilians associated in 1954 with the Field Unit of the Commission on Hemorrhagic Fever, Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, who aided our efforts in Korea; we are especially mindful of the contributions of Dr. Albert A. Barber, Dr. Marshall Hertig, Mr. Louis J. Lipovsky and Dr. Warren D. Thomas. We are grateful also to Mr. Yoshinori Imaizumi, National Science Museum of Japan, for his translations of several papers in Japanese, and to Dr. Edward H. Taylor for making certain pertinent references available to us.   =Hynobius leechii= Boulenger      _Hynobius Leechii_ Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 19:67,       January, 1887 (type locality, Gensan [=Wonsan], Korea).      _Hynobius leechii quelpaertensis_ Mori, Jour. Chosen Nat. Hist.       Soc., 6:47 (Japanese) and 53 (English), March 25, 1928 (type       locality, Quelpart Island [=Cheju Do], Korea).      _Specimens examined_ (3).--1 mi. SW Inje, 1 (KU); 4 mi. NNE     Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 2 (KU).      _Description_ (KU 38774 from 1 mi. SW Inje).--Total length, 86 (head     13, body 40, tail 33); costal grooves (including axillary and     inguinal), 13; two costal grooves between adpressed toes; length of     inner branch of series of vomerine teeth less than distance between     outer border of naris and peak of opposite series (tooth-rows     V-shaped, approximately as long as broad); dorsal surface yellowish     brown or buff (yellowish in life), having numerous blackish marks;     venter yellowish cream, having an indistinct grayish mottling.  _Remarks._--The salamander described above was found in a foxhole with another desiccated individual (not saved) on a military compound on April 24. The only other occurrence of _H. leechii_ on the mainland to come to our attention was the report of several larvae that were seen in a small pool on a hillside near Chip´o-ri in the summer of 1953.  Each of the two specimens from Cheju Do (KU 38775-76) differs from KU 38774 in having (1) the length of inner branch of the vomerine series slightly greater than the distance between outer border of naris and peak of opposite series (tooth-rows V-shaped, longer than broad), (2) a dorsal and ventral keel on the tail, (3) one costal groove (rather than two costal grooves) between adpressed toes, and (4) in being darker both dorsally and ventrally. The area of buff on the dorsal surface of each specimen is reduced by a fine, blackish mottling and stippling, and the venter of each is grayish. Respective total lengths of KU 38775 and 38776 are 84 (head 12, body 36, tail 36) and 89 (12, 35, 42), and the number of costal grooves 13 and 14. Although the two specimens are of approximately the same size, the tail of KU 38776 is noticeably the longer; the tail of KU 38775 is thicker and deeper than that of KU 38776.  The two specimens from 4 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri were taken on September 9 in damp substrate under volcanic rocks along a little-used road; although many rocks were overturned, only these two individuals were found. A South Korean soldier informed us that salamanders were fairly common on Cheju Do.  Mori (1928_a_:16) first mentioned in Japanese text the alleged distinctiveness of the salamander occurring on Cheju Do. Later, Mori (1928_b_:47 in Japanese, and 1928_c_:53 in English) provided valid descriptions of the subspecies, _Hynobius leechii quelpaertensis_. Okada (1934:17) questioned the validity of _H. l. quelpaertensis_ and Sato (1943) regarded the salamanders of Cheju Do as inseparable from the Korean _H. leechii_. The English description of _quelpaertensis_ is briefer than the preceding one in Japanese and lacks comparisons with related forms. KU 38775-76 seemingly differ appreciably from the description of _quelpaertensis_ only in having the series of vomerine teeth narrowly V-shaped and longer than broad. We tentatively follow Sato in regarding _quelpaertensis_ as a synonym of _leechii_.   =Bombina orientalis= (Boulenger)      _Bombinator orientalis_ Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6,       5:143, pl. IX, fig. 2, February, 1890 (type locality restricted to       Chefoo, China, by Pope, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 61:435,       August 29, 1931).      _Bombina orientalis_, Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 58:51, figs.       30-43, pl. VII (reproduction from Boulenger, _supra_), July 22,       1907.      _Specimens examined_ (87).--2 mi. N Chip´o-ri, 8 (KU), 5 (UMMZ); 1     mi. SW Inje, 1 (KU); 15 mi. NE Mosulp´o, Cheju Do, 6 (KU);     Sangdaehwa, 2 (KU); Taehoesan-ni, 1 (KU); 1 mi. W Tangjonggok, 32     (KU), 17 (UMMZ); Tangnim-ni, 2 (KU); 3 mi. SW Yanggu, 1 (KU); 2 mi.     N Yongdae-ri, 8 (KU), 4 (UMMZ).  _Remarks._--Most of our specimens were taken from breeding congresses after heavy rains in rice fields and other shallow temporary waters. Thirteen individuals from Chip´o-ri were collected from foxholes around the edge of a military compound (two pairs in amplexus; no egg masses seen), and represent a small sample of frogs that were everywhere following a heavy rain on the night of May 13-14. On April 23, 32 _Bombina orientalis_ and three _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ were trapped in the water-filled bottom of an unused grease pit near Tangjonggok. Many tadpoles and two kinds of egg masses (small clusters and beadlike strings) were present; the small clusters of _Bombina_ were commonest. On June 13 at the same locality, thousands of these toads were observed (hundreds in axillary amplexus) in foxholes, temporary rain pools, and backwashes along the Puk-ch´on [river]. On June 12 near Yongdae-ri many individuals were seen (several pairs in amplexus), along Route 24 paralleling the Puk-ch´on, in rain pools and in ditches and backwashes from the river; almost all available water contained small (approximately 10 × 10 mm.) egg masses. Numbers of eggs per mass, selected at random, were 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 8, 8, 2 and 5."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34949"],["title","Some Reptiles and Amphibians from Korea (#1)"],["body","that were saved subsequently hatched on June 15-17.  The call is a quiet low trill or series of staccato whistles rising slightly at the beginning; a short peeplike note also was heard. The specimens from Cheju Do, which are generally smaller than those collected on the mainland in spring, were taken on September 6 in a small stream that had large volcanic rocks in many places and that was flanked by thick brush and small trees. The earliest and latest dates on which _B. orientalis_ was collected were April 21 and September 6, respectively.  In the breeding season, males are distinguished from females by the large blackish (probably brownish earlier in season) areas on the anteroventral surface of the antebrachium, the metacarpal tubercle, and the inner surface of the first finger (sometimes also the second and third). Also, males have conspicuous black-tipped tubercles on the back (usually absent in females) that extend onto the limbs (usually smooth in females, at least laterally). Field observations by one of us (Byers) suggested that the dorsal pattern of males had greater contrast than that of females and that the venter was brighter reddish. Eight females from Tangjonggok averaged 47.9 (43-51) in snout-vent length, whereas 24 males from there averaged 50.0 (46-55), indicating little, if any, size difference between the sexes.  Okada (1931:29) recorded variation in color of live Korean individuals (green or brown dorsally and pale yellow or red ventrally) and variation in extent of black markings on the belly (_op. cit._:fig. 12). The specimens from Cheju Do (28, 32, 32, 32, 37 and 46 in snout-vent length) have less black ventrally than specimens from the mainland.   =Bufo bufo gargarizans= Cantor      _Bufo gargarizans_ Cantor, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 1, 9:483,       August, 1842 (type locality, island of Chusan, China).      _Bufo bufo gargarizans_, Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 58:59,       July 22, 1907.      _Specimens examined_ (10).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 1 (KU); 5 mi. NW Choksong, near Imjin River, 1 (KU); 5     mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 4 (KU), 2 (UMMZ); 1 mi. S     Yami-ri, 1 (KU).      _Description (nine females)._--Dorsal surface brownish, having     indistinct pale areas, some of which tend to form longitudinal     stripes that extend posteriorly from parotoid glands; blackish     mark, usually on lateral part of parotoid, having short spurs     directed posteriorly and ventrally; edge of upper jaw and warts on     dorsal surface becoming blackish with increasing size; small,     conspicuous group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoid;     middorsal warts tending, at level of posterior edge of parotoids, to     form a V that has its apex between the parotoids; ventral surface     pale yellowish, sometimes having well-defined blackish marks;     granular underparts of large specimens having small blackish     tubercles.      _Male (KU 40118 from 5 mi. E Seoul)._--Snout-vent length, 65; no     vocal sacs or slits; dorsal and inner surfaces of first and second     fingers, and inner surface of third finger black; canthus rostralis     indistinct (a well-defined ridge on right side); nostrils closer to     tip of snout than to eye, their distance from each other slightly     less than interorbital width; interorbital width (6.2) greater than     width of eyelid (4.7); tympanum distinct, circular, its diameter     (3.0) less than length of eye (6.5), and approximately twice     distance (1.6) of tympanum from eye; no cranial crests; parotoid     gland elongate, approximately twice as long as broad (12.5 × 5.0),     narrowly separated from posterior edge of eyelid; head elongate     (width at posterior edge of tympanum, 23.6); length from posterior     edge of tympanum to tip of upper jaw, 18.9; first finger slightly     longer than second, fourth finger about two-thirds as long as third;     most subarticular tubercles divided; outer palmar tubercle larger     than inner; heels not touching when folded legs placed at right     angles to longitudinal axis of body; tibiotarsal articulation just     reaching eye when leg laid forward; tarsometatarsal articulation not     reaching beyond snout; foot large (tibiotarsal articulation to tip     of fourth toe approximately 46.0); fourth toe approximately half     webbed, other toes more than half webbed; edges of webs somewhat     crenulate; some subarticular tubercles divided; length of inner     metatarsal tubercle (4.5) more than half length of first toe (7.0);     inner metatarsal tubercle larger than outer, both darkened; tarsal     fold extending from inner metatarsal tubercle for approximately     two-thirds length of tarsus; tips of toes (not fingers) darkened;     dorsal surface of back and proximal part of hind legs coarsely     granular, of rounded, pavement-type tubercles lacking sharp tips;     small group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoids; dorsal     pattern contrasting and irregular (especially on limbs), of dark     brown and pale gray; conspicuous black mark (interrupted) on lateral     surface of parotoid having two, well-defined spurs that project     posteroventrally; undersurface granular, lacking markings except for     two indistinctly-margined dark spots on chest, and black spot on     left leg.  _Remarks._--This nocturnal, introduced species (Okada, 1931:47) is presumably widespread in Korea and seemingly prefers lowland habitats. Individuals were taken in sparse vegetation on a sand flat near the Han River, at the edge of a rice field in a light rain, along a road at night, and in millet fields adjacent to the Han River, which was flooding at that time (July 9).  As is obvious from the foregoing descriptions, the male (KU 40118), which was obtained on March 19, differs considerably from the nine females; neither does it agree with Stejneger's (1907:66) or Okada's (_op. cit._:45-46, fig. 18) description of males of _Bufo bufo asiaticus [=gargarizans]_ from Wonsan and Seoul. Upon cursory examination, KU 40118 is notable for having a contrasting dorsal pattern and elongate, ranidlike proportions. Some of the characteristics resemble those of _Bufo raddei_ Strauch as given by Stejneger (_op. cit._:70-72, figs. 53-57), Okada (1935:9, figs. 2 and 32-34, pls. II-III), and Liu (1950:203-205, fig. 43).  Stejneger (_op. cit._:59-68) recognized _B. b. gargarizans_ as occurring in southern China, and _Bufo bufo asiaticus_ as the subspecies occurring in northern China. Subsequently, _asiaticus_ was relegated to synonymy under the earlier-named _gargarizans_--see discussions by Pope and Boring (1940:33) and Liu (_op. cit._:220).   =Kaloula borealis= (Barbour)      _Cacopoides borealis_ Barbour, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 51(12):231,       April, 1908 (type locality, Antung, Manchuria).      _Kaloula borealis_, Noble, Amer. Mus. Novit., 165:6, April 16, 1925.      _Specimens examined_ (8).--5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3     (UMMZ); 7 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU).  _Remarks._--On April 5, one male and three females were uncovered by a bulldozer from between one and two feet below the surface of the ground in an old Korean burial mound; one individual was completely surrounded by compact soil. All quickly became active when placed in water. Two of the females (43 and 44 in snout-vent length) contained masses of immature eggs. A male obtained on June 4 was found during a rain; the three UMMZ specimens were obtained on July 8 on banks above the Han River. Breeding of this species seems to coincide with the rainy season in late spring and early summer when males were noted calling around flooded ditches and swales in deep grass. The local Korean name of the species, which sounds something like \"maeng-kongi,\" is said to come from the call, which is best described as a monotonous, snoring sound that rarely is heard in two parts as suggested by the name.   =Hyla arborea japonica= Günther      [_Hyla arborea_] Var. _japonica_ Günther, Catalogue of the Batrachia       Salientia in the ...

London, p. 579, pl. 51,       fig. 1 (for 1887), April, 1888 (type locality, Port Hamilton, a       small island between Korea and Japan).      _Specimens examined_ (44).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 2 (KU); 3 mi. NW Chip´o-ri, 1 (KU); 1 mi. N Mosulp´o,     Cheju Do, 1 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 13 (KU), 3 (UMMZ);     Sangbonch´on-ni, 2 (UMMZ); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 8 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul,     10 (KU), 3 (UMMZ); 7 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (UMMZ).  _Remarks._--Hylids from 5 mi. ESE Seoul were collected from a cement-walled pit at the Seoul City Water Works; a specimen of _Elaphe rufodorsata_ taken in the pit had eaten one hylid. Two individuals were taken in the morning of May 29 on leaf litter in a wooded valley in the Central National Forest where a number were calling in a light rain, but the species was rarely found in woods. Two frogs were found along a rocky stream at Sangbonch´on-ni. Most individuals were taken while calling, on grasses and reeds or on the ground, along the edges of rice fields. Sixteen hylids collected 1 mi. NW Oho-ri were calling in shallow water of a rice field on a hillside, but none was heard in a large lake nearby or in adjacent fields. On May 15, 4 mi. ESE Ch´orwon, approximately one hundred tadpoles, thought to be of this species, congregated near a drain (into a lower field) of an unused rice field; the tadpoles were well-developed, some having hind legs. The earliest and latest dates of collection represented in our material are May 8 and October 29. The call is best described as a raspy \"waak,\" \"week,\" or \"wiick\" in the middle register.
