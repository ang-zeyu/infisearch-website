You could see the light of the lamp behind the blind, and through the screen door as you came along. And it was here that Jefferson used to sit in the evenings when the shop got empty.  There was a round table that The Woman used to lay for supper, and after supper there used to be a chequered cloth on it and a lamp with a shade. And beside it Jeff would sit, with his spectacles on and the paper spread out, reading about Carnegie and Rockefeller. Near him, but away from the table, was The Woman doing needlework, and Myra, when she wasn't working in the Telephone Exchange, was there too with her elbows on the table reading Marie Corelli--only now, of course, after the fortune, she was reading the prospectuses of Dramatic Schools.  So this night,--I don't know just what it was in the paper that caused it,--Jeff laid down what he was reading and started to talk about Carnegie.  \"This Carnegie, I bet you, would be worth,\" said Jeff, closing up his eyes in calculation, \"as much as perhaps two million dollars, if you was to sell him up. And this Rockefeller and this Morgan, either of them, to sell them up clean, would be worth another couple of million--\"  I may say in parentheses that it was a favourite method in Mariposa if you wanted to get at the real worth of a man, to imagine him clean sold up, put up for auction, as it were. It was the only way to test him.  \"And now look at 'em,\" Jeff went on. \"They make their money and what do they do with it? They give it away. And who do they give it to? Why, to those as don't want it, every time. They give it to these professors and to this research and that, and do the poor get any of it? Not a cent and never will.\"  \"I tell you, boys,\" continued Jeff (there were no boys present, but in Mariposa all really important speeches are addressed to an imaginary audience of boys)--\"I tell you, if I was to make a million out of this Cubey, I'd give it straight to the poor, yes, sir--divide it up into a hundred lots of a thousand dollars each and give it to the people that hadn't nothing.\"  So always after that I knew just what those bananas were being grown for.  Indeed, after that, though Jefferson never spoke of his intentions directly, he said a number of things that seemed to bear on them. He asked me, for instance, one day, how many blind people it would take to fill one of these blind homes and how a feller could get ahold of them. And at another time he asked whether if a feller advertised for some of these incurables a feller could get enough of them to make a showing. I know for a fact that he got Nivens, the lawyer, to draw up a document that was to give an acre of banana land in Cuba to every idiot in Missinaba county.  But still,--what's the use of talking of what Jeff meant to do? Nobody knows or cares about it now.  The end of it was bound to come. Even in Mariposa some of the people must have thought so. Else how was it that Henry Mullins made such a fuss about selling a draft for forty thousand on New York? And why was it that Mr. Smith wouldn't pay Billy, the desk clerk, his back wages when he wanted to put it into Cuba?  Oh yes; some of them must have seen it. And yet when it came it seemed so quiet,--ever so quiet,--not a bit like the Northern Star mine and the oyster supper and the Mariposa band. It is strange how quiet these things look, the other way round.  You remember the Cuban Land frauds in New York and Porforio Gomez shooting the detective, and him and Maximo Morez getting clear away with two hundred thousand? No, of course you don't; why, even in the city papers it only filled an inch or two of type, and anyway the names were hard to remember. That was Jeff's money--part of it. Mullins got the telegram, from a broker or someone, and he showed it to Jeff just as he was going up the street with an estate agent to look at a big empty lot on the hill behind the town--the very place for these incurables.  And Jeff went back to the shop so quiet--have you ever seen an animal that is stricken through, how quiet it seems to move?  Well, that's how he walked.  And since that, though it's quite a little while ago, the shop's open till eleven every night now, and Jeff is shaving away to pay back that five hundred that Johnson, the livery man, sent to the Cubans, and--  Pathetic? tut! tut! You don't know Mariposa. Jeff has to work pretty late, but that's nothing--nothing at all, if you've worked hard all your lifetime. And Myra is back at the Telephone Exchange--they were glad enough to get her, and she says now that if there's one thing she hates, it's the stage, and she can't see how the actresses put up with it.  Anyway, things are not so bad. You see it was just at this time that Mr. Smith's caff opened, and Mr. Smith came to Jeff's Woman and said he wanted seven dozen eggs a day, and wanted them handy, and so the hens are back, and more of them, and they exult so every morning over the eggs they lay that if you wanted to talk of Rockefeller in the barber shop you couldn't hear his name for the cackling.     THREE. The Marine Excursions of the Knights of Pythias  Half-past six on a July morning! The Mariposa Belle is at the wharf, decked in flags, with steam up ready to start.  Excursion day!  Half past six on a July morning, and Lake Wissanotti lying in the sun as calm as glass. The opal colours of the morning light are shot from the surface of the water.  Out on the lake the last thin threads of the mist are clearing away like flecks of cotton wool.  The long call of the loon echoes over the lake. The air is cool and fresh. There is in it all the new life of the land of the silent pine and the moving waters. Lake Wissanotti in the morning sunlight! Don't talk to me of the Italian lakes, or the Tyrol or the Swiss Alps. Take them away. Move them somewhere else. I don't want them.  Excursion Day, at half past six of a summer morning! With the boat all decked in flags and all the people in Mariposa on the wharf, and the band in peaked caps with big cornets tied to their bodies ready to play at any minute! I say! Don't tell me about the Carnival of Venice and the Delhi Durbar. Don't! I wouldn't look at them. I'd shut my eyes! For light and colour give me every time an excursion out of Mariposa down the lake to the Indian's Island out of sight in the morning mist. Talk of your Papal Zouaves and your Buckingham Palace Guard! I want to see the Mariposa band in uniform and the Mariposa Knights of Pythias with their aprons and their insignia and their picnic baskets and their five-cent cigars!  Half past six in the morning, and all the crowd on the wharf and the boat due to leave in half an hour. Notice it!--in half an hour. Already she's whistled twice (at six, and at six fifteen), and at any minute now, Christie Johnson will step into the pilot house and pull the string for the warning whistle that the boat will leave in half an hour. So keep ready. Don't think of running back to Smith's Hotel for the sandwiches. Don't be fool enough to try to go up to the Greek Store, next to Netley's, and buy fruit. You'll be left behind for sure if you do. Never mind the sandwiches and the fruit! Anyway, here comes Mr. Smith himself with a huge basket of provender that would feed a factory. There must be sandwiches in that. I think I can hear them clinking. And behind Mr. Smith is the German waiter from the caff with another basket--indubitably lager beer; and behind him, the bar-tender of the hotel, carrying nothing, as far as one can see. But of course if you know Mariposa you will understand that why he looks so nonchalant and empty-handed is because he has two bottles of rye whiskey under his linen duster. You know, I think, the peculiar walk of a man with two bottles of whiskey in the inside pockets of a linen coat. In Mariposa, you see, to bring beer to an excursion is quite in keeping with public opinion. But, whiskey,--well, one has to be a little careful.  Do I say that Mr. Smith is here? Why, everybody's here. There's Hussell the editor of the Newspacket, wearing a blue ribbon on his coat, for the Mariposa Knights of Pythias are, by their constitution, dedicated to temperance; and there's Henry Mullins, the manager of the Exchange Bank, also a Knight of Pythias, with a small flask of Pogram's Special in his hip pocket as a sort of amendment to the constitution. And there's Dean Drone, the Chaplain of the Order, with a fishing-rod (you never saw such green bass as lie among the rocks at Indian's Island), and with a trolling line in case of maskinonge, and a landing net in case of pickerel, and with his eldest daughter, Lilian Drone, in case of young men. There never was such a fisherman as the Rev. Rupert Drone.   Perhaps I ought to explain that when I speak of the excursion as being of the Knights of Pythias, the thing must not be understood in any narrow sense. In Mariposa practically everybody belongs to the Knights of Pythias just as they do to everything else. That's the great thing about the town and that's what makes it so different from the city. Everybody is in everything.  You should see them on the seventeenth of March, for example, when everybody wears a green ribbon and they're all laughing and glad,--you know what the Celtic nature is,--and talking about Home Rule.  On St. Andrew's Day every man in town wears a thistle and shakes hands with everybody else, and you see the fine old Scotch honesty beaming out of their eyes.  And on St. George's Day!--well, there's no heartiness like the good old English spirit, after all; why shouldn't a man feel glad that he's an Englishman?  Then on the Fourth of July there are stars and stripes flying over half the stores in town, and suddenly all the men are seen to smoke cigars, and to know all about Roosevelt and Bryan and the Philippine Islands. Then you learn for the first time that Jeff Thorpe's people came from Massachusetts and that his uncle fought at Bunker Hill (it must have been Bunker Hill,--anyw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],["title","Life of Heber C.

LIFE OF   HEBER C. KIMBALL,   AN APOSTLE;   THE FATHER AND FOUNDER OF THE BRITISH MISSION.  ----  BY ORSON F. WHITNEY.  ----  It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who, in the midst of the crowd, keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of his character.--_Emerson_.  ----  PUBLISHED BY THE KIMBALL FAMILY,  SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.   PRINTED AT THE JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR OFFICE.  1888.       TO THE MEMORY OF   My GRANDFATHER;   AND TO THE GREAT   Cause of Truth,   _For which he lived and died; and to all who love that   Memory and that Cause,   This Volume is reverently Dedicated by_   THE AUTHOR.     PREFACE.   In presenting this work to the public, I not only fulfill the desires of my own heart and those of my kindred who have undertaken to publish what is here written and compiled, but likewise, I am persuaded, the wish of our departed ancestor. Laying the foundation for such a work while living (as the copious selections from his own writings will testify), he left its bringing forth as a sacred legacy to his posterity.  For many years this duty, unenjoined in words, but accepted by all in the light of a behest, was permitted to lie dormant. The death of President Kimball, on the 22nd of June, 1868, was a calamity so sudden and heavy in its effect upon his family, as to almost paralyze thought and effort. Though trained to independence and self-reliance, under his wise government, and never pampered in ease and luxury, they had ever looked to him for guidance and support, and had never known the weight of responsibility resting upon him as their parent and provider, only as from time to time he had taken certain ones into his confidence and permitted them to share his burdens.  In his absence they were as sheep that had lost their shepherd. \"Who will provide for us now, and what shall we do to earn a livelihood?\" Such were the thoughts presented to their minds, and the questions asked of their secret souls, as they looked around upon their temporal situation. The division of the parental estate had left them comfortable, though far from rich, None of his sons had trades, but all had been brought up to work. Realizing that a city life was no longer their lot, they resolved to separate, and, following the example of their ancestors for generations, go forth and colonize new regions. Some moved north, and others south, but few remaining in the city of their birth, and at the expiration of fifteen years, many had become almost as strangers to each other.  About the year 1883 a spirit of inquiry commenced to manifest itself among the members of the Kimball family, causing them to \"feel after\" and evince more interest in each other's welfare. This sentiment increasing, some of the elder members at length opened a correspondence on the subject of a family reunion. By many this was deemed impracticable, owing to their scattered condition; some living in Idaho, some in southern Arizona, and others in California; and nearly all in circumstances which, it was thought, would hardly justify the necessary outlay. But the desire to meet and mingle with each other finally grew so urgent and so general among them--as though some unseen power were at work in their midst, with this object in view--that it was determined to hold the reunion, no matter what sacrifice it entailed.  During the summer of 1886, a number of the family met and appointed a Committee on Reunion, selecting for the day, June 14th, 1887, (the eighty-sixth anniversary of their father's birth) and as the place of meeting, Fuller's Hill Gardens, Salt Lake City. There came together on that memorable occasion, fully three hundred members and relatives of the Kimball family, with others who had been invited to take part in the celebration. A programme, previously arranged, consisting of speeches, recitations, readings, vocal and instrumental music, etc., was carried out to the satisfaction and enjoyment of all, and the remainder of the time spent in amusement, festivity and recreation. A spirit of peace and union, powerful and indescribable, pervaded the assembly and permeated the whole occasion, causing every heart to swell with love, and many an eye to glisten with tears of gratitude and joy. As though, indeed, the spirits of the departed were there, bringing with them the sweet influences of the celestial world, to weld anew, as links of a broken chain, the souls of those so long separated. It was, in truth, a day never to be forgotten.  There were present, of the family of President Kimball, nineteen sons, six daughters, and several of his widows, besides grand-children, and many other relatives, near and remote.  One of the features of the programme was a sketch of the life of Heber C. Kimball, written for the occasion and read by his grandson, the author of this work. This incident determined and united the family on a project mooted by its members and partly executed several years before. It was the publication of the life of Heber C. Kimball. On the evening of the day of reunion the male members of the family met and appointed a committee of five on publication. Several thousand dollars of undivided property, still in the estate, was devoted to the purpose, and the author hereof solicited, and by unanimous voice chosen and engaged to write the history.  Such, in brief, were the immediate causes of the coming forth of this volume.  In the execution of my task, I have felt strongly moved upon by the spirit of my grandsire, and verily believe that his presence, though unseen, has hovered near me.  This book is written from the standpoint of a Latter-day Saint. It makes no apology for the honest expression of views, which, however false or fanatical they may seem to others, are in the opinion of the author only such as ought to be entertained by every sincere believer and defender of the faith. It is issued with the humble and earnest hope that it may go forth as a messenger of Truth to help prepare the way for greater things that shall glorify God and redeem Zion. The life of a man like Heber C. Kimball, with its lessons of faith and humility, of virtue, courage and devotion, cannot fail, if prayerfully read, to do something in this direction.  Wherever possible, I have allowed the subject to speak for himself. In lieu of converting facts found of record in his Journal into \"original matter,\" I have presented them mostly in all their freshness and simplicity; as flowers of the field, with the dew and fragrance of their native meadow yet clinging to them. This has been done, not only out of deference to the wishes of his relatives, who desired that much of what their father had written should be incorporated in the book of his life, but because I have deemed it best to thus project upon the reader's mental vision, by means of the most superior process, the portrait of the man and his mission as painted by himself.  I cannot close this introductory without expressing my deep sense of indebtedness to the kind friends who have aided and encouraged me in the bringing forth of this, my first book. Their name is legion, but limited space will only permit the mention of a few. To President Wilford Woodruff and others of the Apostles I am indebted for kind words and encouragement, and for the appointment of a committee, at my request, to read the manuscript and pass upon it critically, as to doctrinal and historical points, before placing it in the hands of the printer; to Elder George Reynolds, for his intelligent advice and labors as one of said committee; and to Edward W. Tullidge Esq., the veteran author, for a collection of facts relating to my subject, gathered during his extensive experience as historian and biographer. Last, but not least, in this limited reference, I am under obligations of gratitude to my uncle, Solomon F. Kimball, the chief promoter of this work, who first approached me on the subject of writing his father's life, and who, in all the toils incident to such an undertaking, has proved my staunch and faithful friend.  My labor, I need hardly say, in conclusion, has been one of love and duty. I have fulfilled, imperfectly I know, conscientiously I am as certain, what I considered a sacred trust; the result of which I now lay at the feet of an indulgent public.
