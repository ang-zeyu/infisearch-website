Microtus _cf._ cantator Anderson  Yukon Singing Mouse      _Microtus cantator_ Anderson, Nat. Mus. Canada, Bull. No. 102,   Biol. Ser. No. 31:161, [for 1946], January 24, 1947. (Type \"taken   in tundra-slide above timber-line on mountain top near Tepee Lake   on north slope of St. Elias Range,\" Yukon Territory, Canada.)  _Specimen examined._--One from _Alaska_: Fish Creek, 3400 ft., 5 mi. N and 1 mi. E Paxson.  _Remarks._--The single adult male, obtained by Alcorn, has been compared by Dr. Henry W. Setzer with specimens of _Microtus muriei_ Nelson, _M. miurus miurus_ Osgood, and _M. m. oreas_ Osgood in the United States National Museum. He reports that the specimen is related most closely to _M. miurus_ but exhibits characters by which it is, at least, subspecifically distinct from these two forms of this species. Three specimens of _M. andersoni_ Rand and one of _M. cantator_ Anderson, borrowed from the National Museum of Canada are less mature than the specimen in question. Even so, the male from Fish Creek is less gray than _M. andersoni_ and as seen from measurements of the type, an adult male (Rand, 1945:42), is larger with longer tail and has a shorter and narrower skull and is judged to be taxonomically separable. _M. cantator_ was named from two specimens; both the paratype (seen by me) and seemingly the type are too young to show clearly subspecific characters. Alcorn's specimen is tentatively referred to _M. cantator_ until some adult topotypes can be obtained. Measurements of the male, No. 21539, from Fish Creek, are: Total length, 152; length of tail, 30; hind foot, 22; condylobasal length, 28.0; basal length, 26.6; length of nasals, 7.1; zygomatic breadth, 13.8; breadth across auditory bullae, 11.5; least interorbital breadth, 3.3; alveolar length of upper molariform tooth-row, 6.2.  Alcorn took this specimen in an area above timberline where a low growth of willow was the dominant vegetation. Traps were set where he had seen a mouse go into a small burrow. The next morning, August 18, 1947, he found this specimen and two _Microtus oeconomus macfarlani_ in his traps.  Microtines of the subgenus _Stenocranius_ from continental areas of Alaska and Northwestern Canada are represented in collections by a few specimens from widely separated localities. Lacking material from intermediate localities, describers have given specific recognition to several of these isolated populations. Future collecting will be necessary to disclose whether the North American mice of this subgenus belong to one or to more than one species and may disclose whether or not there has been more than one invasion of the North American continent by members of this Asiatic group.   Microtus longicaudus vellerosus J. A. Allen  Long-tailed Meadow Mouse      _Microtus vellerosus_ J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,   12:7, March 4, 1899. (Type from upper Liard River, British Columbia,   Canada.)      _Microtus longicaudus vellerosus_ Anderson and Rand, Canadian   Field-Nat., 58:20, April 1, 1944.  _Specimens examined._--Total 127, as follows: _Alaska_: N side Salcha River, 600 ft., 25 mi. S and 20 mi. E Fairbanks, 1. _Yukon Territory_: 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2550 ft., 2; McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 10; ½ mi. W Whitehorse, 1; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 18; 1½ mi. S and 3 mi.

W Fort Nelson, 1.  _Remarks._--Specimens from 1½ miles south and 3 miles east of Dalton Post and from Dezadeash Lake in Yukon Territory and from Stonehouse Creek in British Columbia are referred to _M. l. vellerosus_ although in color of upper parts they show close relationship with _M. l. littoralis_. These specimens are less gray and more brown than specimens more typical of _M. l. vellerosus_ from the Liard River area.  Alcorn found the long-tailed meadow mouse in widely separated areas. Most specimens were obtained in grassy situations near water or on moist ground. The single male from Summit Pass in British Columbia was taken above timberline.   Microtus longicaudus littoralis Swarth  Long-tailed Meadow Mouse      _Microtus mordax littoralis_ Swarth, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,   46:209, October 26, 1933. (Type from Shakan, Prince of Wales Island,   Alaska.)      _Microtus longicaudus littoralis_ Goldman, Jour. Mamm., 19:491,   November 14, 1938.  _Specimens examined._--Total 29, as follows: _Alaska_: E side Chilkat River, 100 ft., 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines, 9; 1 mi. S Haines, 5 ft., 20.  _Remarks._--In comparison with the series of _M. l. vellerosus_ from the Liard River area, the long-tailed meadow mice from near Haines are more reddish brown, have a longer tail, and have a smaller skull with smaller auditory bullae. This subspecies is restricted to the coastal area, and as noted under the account of _M. l. vellerosus_, intergradation between these two forms occurs a relatively short distance inland.

Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 2.  _Remarks._--Alcorn found the tundra mouse in many of the localities at which he trapped in east-central Alaska. Specimens were taken above timberline, along roads, in grassy areas which had been cleared of timber, and in low vegetation bordering streams. On August 17 at Fish Creek, 5 miles north and 1 mile east of Paxson, Alaska, Alcorn obtained one of these mice in a tree in the daytime. Immature specimens taken at Stonehouse Creek are, to my knowledge, the first records for this species in British Columbia.   Mus musculus Linnaeus  House Mouse      _[Mus] musculus_ Linnaeus, Syst.

One mouse was taken near Whitehorse on July 10 under a building which had not been occupied for one year. Another was taken at the Whitehorse city dump. Near Kinuso, one specimen was obtained at the site of an old sawmill.   Zapus hudsonius hudsonius (Zimmermann)  Meadow Jumping Mouse      _Dipus hudsonius_ Zimmermann, Geogr. Gesch., 2:358, 1780.

Terr.,   ser. 2, 1:253, January 8, 1876.  _Specimens examined._--Total 8, as follows: _British Columbia_: 1 mi. NW jct. Irons Creek and Liard River, 3; Hot Springs, 3 mi. WNW jct. Trout River and Liard River, 1; E side Minaker River, 1 mi. W Trutch, 1; 5 mi. W and 3 mi. N Fort St. John, 1. _Alberta_: Assineau River, 1920 ft., 10 mi. E and 1 mi. N Kinuso, 1.  _Remarks._--The jumping mice listed above have been compared with specimens of _Z. h. hudsonius_ from Ontario and Michigan. The zone of contact between _Z. h. hudsonius_ and _Z. h. alascensis_ is still unknown; Alcorn obtained no specimens between Irons Creek and Whitehorse. To my knowledge there are no records from this extensive area.  Alcorn took _Zapus_ in grassy areas at the edge of water, in an old gravel pit, and at the site of an old sawmill. Animals were taken as early as June 30 and as late as September 2.   Zapus hudsonius alascensis Merriam  Meadow Jumping Mouse      _Zapus hudsonius alascensis_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc.

Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 4.  _Remarks._--Specimens taken by Alcorn were compared with representatives of both _Z. princeps_ (Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon) and _Z. hudsonius_ (Ontario, Michigan, Kansas, Wyoming). All have been referred to _Z. hudsonius_ although one female from Stonehouse Creek shows some tendency toward _Z. princeps_ in external measurements, length of upper molariform tooth-row, and length of incisive foramina.

S Fort Nelson, 2.  _Remarks._--One large, unsexed skull from Buckinghorse River with part of the rostrum gone has the frontal shield strongly dished. A young adult female taken 10 miles west of Fort Nelson on August 23, 1948, has the following external measurements: Total length, 1345; tail, 65; hind foot, 256; ear from notch, 135.   Ursus species  Grizzly  _Specimens examined._--Total 5, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: E side Aishihik River, 17 mi. N Canyon, 1; Unahini River, 5 mi. N and 1 mi. E Dalton Post, 1; Unahini River, 3 mi. N and 1 mi. E Dalton Post, 2. _British Columbia_: Buckinghorse River, 94 mi. S Fort Nelson, 1.  _Remarks._--Of three specimens obtained at the Unahini River, two males resemble each other closely, while the third, an old adult represented by an unsexed skull with broken cranium, is markedly different, the skull being noticeably shorter with shorter rostrum and lower jaw and other distinctive features. It closely resembles the skull of an adult male taken at the Aishihik River. Furthermore, the first two animals show close relationships with an unsexed skull which Alcorn obtained at the Buckinghorse River in British Columbia.  Two males taken at the Unahini River in the Yukon Territory have the following external measurements: Total length, 1933, 1812; tail, 150, 96; hind foot, 262, 260; ear from notch, 129, 131. Other specimens, skulls only, obtained from native hunters, are partly broken. Alcorn writes that the local hunters always shoot a grizzly in the head to be certain that it is dead.

Land Mamm. 1911,   p. 101, December 31, 1912.  _Specimen examined._--One (broken and unsexed skull) from _Yukon Territory_: Champagne, N side Dezadeash River.  _Remarks._--While studying moose at Medicine Lake, near Circle Hot Springs, Alaska, on August 9, 1947, Alcorn observed some mink concerning which he records the following: \"After waiting about an hour a large mink was seen traveling northward on land at the edge of the lake. It continued and went out of sight. I waited about two minutes and then started a series of loud squeaks. To our surprise we soon saw what we judged was the same mink. In company with this mink were five others.... These mink were much interested in the squeaking noise and some came within 10 feet of me. They stayed on land most of the time but some of them made short swims a few feet out into the lake. One had a white chin, another had a white spot on its chest. This group may have been an adult female with her young.\"   Martes pennanti columbiana Goldman  Fisher      _Martes pennanti columbiana_ Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc.
