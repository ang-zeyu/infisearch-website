COURTSHIP   Waxwings are gregarious birds and individuals establish no well-defined territories as do many birds. The nest itself is the only defended territory, and as Crouch (1936) has shown, the Cedar Waxwing will nest in close proximity to others of the same species. Swarth (1932:275) mentions that the Bohemian Waxwing is tolerant of the nests of other pairs near by. The extreme condition is that found in _Dulus_, in which the territory is not limited even to the nest, but to the individual compartment of the community nest. _Phainopepla_, a less gregarious bird than _Dulus_ and waxwings, has a much more definite territory, although individuals of _Phainopepla_ are tolerant of others of the same species; no feeding territory is established, and small flocks of birds feed together at any time of the year.  In birds whose territories lack well-defined boundaries, it would be expected that elaborate song would not have evolved, and that most of the recognition of kind and sex would be dependent upon the behavior of the birds. This is the fact; song, as such, is lacking in the three subfamilies Bombycillinae, Ptilogonatinae, and Dulinae. Waxwings utter (1) notes that serve to keep the flock together, (2) calls used by the young in begging for food, and (3) some low notes that Crouch (_op. cit._:2) considered as possibly concerned with courtship. _Phainopepla_ has various call notes, and in addition, a succession of notes which are run together. _Ptilogonys_ utters a note which Skutch (MS) characterizes as a loud, not unmusical \"tu-whip\" that is used as the birds \"fly in straggling parties which keep in contact by their constant chatter.\" _Dulus_ is described by Wetmore and Swales (1931:349) as having only a variety of rather harsh chattering notes in chorus.  The most notable behavior pattern associated with courtship in Waxwings, in the absence of song, is the so-called \"mating dance\" described by Crouch (1936), and observed by me in Lawrence, Kansas, in the spring of 1948. This consists of one bird of a pair (presumably the male) hopping along a branch toward the other bird (the female), then away again, repeating the procedure for some little time. The female remains motionless until, as the male approaches, mutual fondling of the head and neck feathers takes place, or the birds may peck at each other's bill. A berry may be passed from bill to bill, although generally the berry is not utilized for food, and this can be interpreted as a nervous reaction of the birds. It may be an instance of \"false feeding\" as is seen in many birds, in which the female begs for food, as a nestling would beg, as a preliminary to the sexual act. I am of the opinion that these reactions are in the nature of behavioristic patterns that bring the birds into the emotional balance for copulation, as copulation follows the \"dance.\" Sometimes, however, copulation is preceded by a \"nuptial flight\" around the nesting area, at which time the birds utter loud calls. Armstrong (1924:183) is of the same opinion, citing numerous instances in which nuptial flights and elaborate displays have evolved for just this purpose. The birds are then in the proper physiological balance to initiate the complicated sequence of copulation, nesting, incubation, feeding, and brooding of the young.  It would be valuable to know more concerning the life histories of the other birds considered in this paper, since behavior is inherent, and probably can be cited as evidence of close relationship or the opposite. All that I have been able to learn is that _Phainopepla_ has a nuptial flight in which the male chases the female, and that _Dulus_ (Wetmore and Swales, 1931:347) seeks the company of others of its kind at all times, and that two birds, presumably paired, will sidle up to one another when they are perched.     NEST BUILDING   There are numerous papers concerning the nesting of waxwings. _B. garrula_, owing to its nesting in the far north, where observers are few, has received less attention than _B. cedrorum_. There is, on the other hand, no literature that deals with the nesting habits of the majority of the Ptilogonatines, with the exception of _Phainopepla_, on which there is considerable literature (Merriam, 1896; Myers, 1907, 1908). No detailed study of the nesting of _Dulus_ has been reported, although Wetmore and Swales (1931) have described carefully the large communal nest of this genus.  In _Bombycilla_, both members of a pair apparently aid in the construction of the nest (Crouch, 1936; Swarth, 1932). Although the sexes are alike in plumage and general appearance, most students of the nesting of waxwings agree that one bird, assumed to be the female, does most of the arranging of the material, and does the shaping of the nest, whereas both birds carry materials to the nest site. As is characteristic of many passerine birds, both members of the pair gather materials and fly back to the nest site, where the female takes the more active part in the construction of the nest itself.  Both species of American waxwings build bulky nests, with the base or platform composed of a large amount of twigs and sticks, from which there often trails a mass of sticks and moss or string. Softer materials such as moss, plant fibers, and string, are placed inside the platform; moss is readily available to, and preferred by, _B. garrula_ according to Swarth (_op. cit._:271), and various plant fibers and string are used by _B. cedrorum_. The inner lining consists of soft plant fibers or down, dry grasses, and feathers. The nest is usually unconcealed in a tree either adjacent to a trunk or on a main side branch, but sometimes in a fork. Nest building by both Cedar and Bohemian waxwings is rapid, taking from three to five days, and is followed immediately by egg laying.  Nesting by waxwings is late in the season; June is the month in which the nest is usually started. This is readily explainable in Bohemian Waxwings, since adverse weather would prohibit earlier nesting in the area in which they spend the summer. Crouch (_op. cit._:1) remarks that _B. cedrorum_ possibly evolved in the far north where it was impossible for it to start nesting earlier, and that the habit has been retained. Perhaps, on the other hand, nesting is delayed until the berry crop is ripe, to insure sufficient food for the young.  Desertion of the nest is not uncommon in waxwings, despite the tolerance to other animals that is shown by the birds. A new nest may suddenly be begun before the first one is finished, and all the materials from the first nest may be removed, or the nest may be abandoned before it is completed. The eggs may be left at any time up to hatching, and the young may be deserted, especially in the earlier stages of development.  The very large and bulky communal nest of _Dulus_ is not radically different from the nest of waxwings. In the absence of sufficient nesting sites, a pair of gregarious birds such as _Dulus_ could combine their nest with those of other pairs, retaining for their own territory only the nest cavity, and in this way communal nests might have evolved. The nest of _Dulus_ is communal probably because of the lack of suitable trees for nesting sites, and only incidentally does this type of nest afford better protection from natural marauders. Large numbers of Palm-chats work together in the construction of the nest platform, and both sexes probably take part in the work.  In _Phainopepla_ the nest is built mostly by the male (Merriam, 1896; Myers, 1908), although the female does some of the work, especially in the shaping and lining of the nest. In this genus, the nest is usually a compact structure, but exceptional nests are of considerable bulk. The nest is commonly placed in a fork near the main trunk of a tree, in a conspicuous location, and generally is 10 to 20 feet from the ground. In shape and location, the nest closely corresponds to that of _Bombycilla_, but the materials used for a base are stems of annual plants, whereas _Bombycilla_ uses more woody twigs. The finer materials used by _Phainopepla_ are more readily obtainable in the ecological association inhabited by _Phainopepla_ than would be heavier twigs such as _Bombycilla_ uses.     FOOD   Waxwings are typically frugivorous; berries are the staple food. The birds are known to catch insects, especially in the spring and summer, and their insect gathering technique has been likened to that of Tyrannid flycatchers. Nice (1941) experimented with a young captive Cedar Waxwing and found that it had a decided preference for red or blue berries, and that meal worms were utilized as food only when the birds became educated by other captive birds of other species as to the food value of the worms. Post (1916) indicates that the food given to the nestlings of Cedar Waxwings is entirely animal for the first three days, and that a mixed diet of berries and insects is subsequently offered.  In feeding of the young, regurgitation of partly digested food does not take place, according to Wheelock (1905). Rather, the adults \"store\" food in the form of berries in the expanded esophagus or crop, feeding them whole to the young. Digestion is an unusually rapid process, involving merely minutes for the passage of berries and cherries. This is correlated with a short intestinal tract, which is unusual for a frugivorous bird. Nice's (1940) experiments with Cedar Waxwings revealed that cherries would pass through the digestive tract in 20 minutes, blueberries in 28 minutes, and chokecherries in 40 minutes. Heinroth (1924) states that berries pass through the digestive tract of Bohemian Waxwings in the space of a \"few minutes.\" This rapid digestion is obviously adaptive, since the value of the food is slight and therefore large quantities of it must be ingested; the large seeds would hamper further ingestion until they were eliminated, since they seem not to be regurgitated. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34556"],["title","Phylogeny of the Waxwings and Allied Birds (#5)"],["body"," Members of the subfamily Ptilogonatinae are both insectivorous and frugivorous insofar as available data show, although again there is relatively little information available concerning them. Skutch (MS) has found that the Guatemalan _Ptilogonys cinereus_ catches insects by repeated sallies into the air from a perch, after the manner of flycatchers. He notes also that the birds feed on berries of _Eurya theoides_ and _Monnina xalapensis_. It is well known that _Phainopepla_ catches insects when these are available, and its liking for berries is so apparent that in parts of its range, it is known as the \"pepper bird,\" since it frequents pepper trees (_Schinus molle_) and feeds on the small red berries. The preserved specimens of _Ptilogonys_ and _Phainoptila_ available for this study contain only berries in the digestive tract. _Dulus_ feeds mostly, if not wholly, on plant food. According to Wetmore and Swales (1931:349), berries, fruits, and parts of flowers are eaten.     SKELETON   A critical analysis of the skeletons provides evidence that aids the student in estimating which differences are merely the result of habits developed in relatively recent geological time as opposed to those which owe their existence to more ancient heritage. Stresses caused by the action of different sets of muscles can apparently stimulate changes in bones to meet new needs, and the evidence from genetics is that such mutations in wild birds are minute and cumulative, rather than of large degree and of sudden appearance. Once adaptive mutations have occurred, if genetic isolation from one source or another accompanies it, a new population different from the parental stock may become established. Study of the skeleton of any species of living bird may indicate those characters identifiable as modifications fitting it to a particular environment. If no distinguishing characters are discovered that may be attributed to environmental factors, such a species can be spoken of as generalized; the inference then is that such a species is not modified for a single, particular ecological niche.  Some parts of the skeleton, obviously, are more adaptable or plastic than others. The beak seems to be the most adaptable part. Probably this results from its frequent use; it is the part of the bird to capture the food. The long bones, meeting the environment as legs which serve as landing mechanisms or as locomotory appendages, and as wings which provide considerable locomotion for most birds, probably come next in order as regards plasticity. In these parts, then, one may look for the most change in birds, which, within relatively recent geologic times, have been modified to fit a particular set of conditions. From the beak and long bones of a species in which habits are unknown, one can infer the habits and habitat from a comparison with the skeletal features of species of known habits.   _Skull._--The skulls in all three subfamilies have essentially the same general appearance and structure, the most marked differences being, as would be expected, in the bills and associated bones.  The most specialized bill is to be found in _Dulus_; its bill is decurved, and the associated bones are correspondingly changed for support of the bill. For example, the palatines and \"vomer\" are much wider, the palatines are more concave from below and have longer posterior processes than the corresponding bones in _Bombycilla_. Moreover, the \"vomer\" in _Dulus_ and in _Phainoptila_ is larger and heavier than in _Bombycilla_, and the quadrate and pterygoid bones are relatively large for support of the beak. The palatines, however, are weak in _Phainoptila_. In the Ptilogonatinae, with the exception of _Phainoptila_, the wings of the palatines flare more than in _Bombycilla_, but not to the extent that they do in _Dulus_, nor does the palatine bone present a concave appearance in the Ptilogonatinae. The premaxilla is a relatively weak bone in _Bombycilla_ and _Phainopepla_, stronger in _Ptilogonys_, and is notably heavy in _Phainoptila_ and _Dulus_, and in these latter two genera shows a sharply-ridged tomium. The maxillae connect to somewhat widened nasal and naso-lateral processes in all the genera, and the premaxillae narrow abruptly from this point forward. In the family, _Phainopepla_ and _Phainoptila_ show the least flaring in this region.     [Illustration: Figs. 1-7. Skulls in lateral view of five genera of                  Bombycillidae.

In _Phainopepla_ there is much variability in this character; some specimens have a narrower antorbital bridge than others. Only one skeleton of _Phainopepla n. nitens_ was available. The flaring in the skull of this specimen is identical with that in _Ptilogonys_. Among the skulls of _P. n. lepida_ in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, is No. 19228, a juvenile, taken 5 miles south of Tucson, Arizona. In this specimen, the flaring in the antorbital region is clearly evident and equal in amount to that in skulls of _P. n. nitens_, but the bird had not attained full skeletal growth. However, the flaring of the antorbital region appears to be common in the nestlings of many species of passerine birds. Other specimens of the subspecies _lepida_ show a varying amount of flaring, the least (in the series available) being in No. 24754, MNH, in which the proportion of the skull (length divided by width) closely corresponds to that in _Phainoptila_; the skull of No. 24754 is long and thin, and the base of the bill is only slightly swollen. The skull of _Phainopepla nitens lepida_ is more generalized than that of _Phainopepla n. nitens_, having a longer and narrower bill like the generalized _Phainoptila_. In _Phainopepla n. nitens_ and in members of the genus _Ptilogonys_, more flaring occurs in the antorbital region.  _Phainoptila_, as noted above, has no great amount of flaring in the antorbital region. When more specimens of _Phainoptila_ are examined, the base of the bill probably will be found to flare more in some individuals than in others; this would be expected if we may judge by the data on _Phainopepla_. The premaxilla and maxilla of _Phainoptila_ are similar to the same bones in _Dulus_, and there is a well-marked ridge on the tomium (possibly for cutting flower parts). In _Phainoptila_, the palatines are narrower than in any other genus of the family and abut the lacrimals. The entire skull appears to be modified along different lines from those of the skull of _Dulus_; the skull of _Phainoptila_ seems to be modified for a frugivorous rather than an insectivorous diet. The skull of _Phainoptila_ probably is more nearly similar to the ancestral skull than is that of any other living species in the family. The wide gape characteristic of some members of the family is undoubtedly a modification for aiding in the capture of insects, and _Phainoptila_ has progressed less in this direction than have other species in the family.  The mandibles vary somewhat in the shape and proportionate size of the bones. The mandible is proportionately, as well as actually, highest in _Dulus_. The medial condyle varies to some extent, being slightly flattened mediad in _Bombycilla_, and less so in the other genera. The mandible of _Bombycilla_ narrows to the symphysis much more gradually than it does in the other genera.  The antorbital plate is large and divides the orbital chamber from the nasal chamber. The small lacrimal bone anterior to the plate articulates with the maxilla and the premaxilla. Shufeldt (1889) states that the free lacrimal ossicle might be of some taxonomic importance in the passerines, since it is found in the"]]]
