The poem which gives this collection of his lovely verse its name has been extensively reprinted, and received with unusual enthusiasm.  The volume contains, as well, a striking essay in character by his friend, Sir Andrew Macphail.  ========    {Although the poem itself is included shortly, this next section is included for completeness, and to show John McCrae's punctuation -- also to show that I'm not the only one who forgets lines. -- A. L.}   IN FLANDERS FIELDS            In Flanders fields the poppies grow           Between the crosses, row on row           That mark our place:  and in the sky           The larks still bravely singing, fly           Scarce heard amid the guns below.            We are the Dead.  Short days ago           We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,           Loved, and were loved, and now we lie           In Flanders fields.            Take up our quarrel with the foe:           To you from failing hands we throw           The Torch:  be yours to hold it high!           If ye break faith with us who die           We shall not sleep, though poppies grow           In Flanders fields.

We are the Dead.  Short days ago           We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,            Loved and were loved, and now we lie,                       In Flanders fields.

If ye break faith with us who die           We shall not sleep, though poppies grow                       In Flanders fields.     The Anxious Dead              O guns, fall silent till the dead men hear            Above their heads the legions pressing on:           (These fought their fight in time of bitter fear,            And died not knowing how the day had gone.)            O flashing muzzles, pause, and let them see            The coming dawn that streaks the sky afar;           Then let your mighty chorus witness be            To them, and Caesar, that we still make war.            Tell them, O guns, that we have heard their call,            That we have sworn, and will not turn aside,           That we will onward till we win or fall,            That we will keep the faith for which they died.            Bid them be patient, and some day, anon,            They shall feel earth enwrapt in silence deep;           Shall greet, in wonderment, the quiet dawn,            And in content may turn them to their sleep.     The Warrior              He wrought in poverty, the dull grey days,            But with the night his little lamp-lit room           Was bright with battle flame, or through a haze            Of smoke that stung his eyes he heard the boom           Of Bluecher's guns; he shared Almeida's scars,            And from the close-packed deck, about to die,           Looked up and saw the \"Birkenhead\"'s tall spars            Weave wavering lines across the Southern sky:            Or in the stifling 'tween decks, row on row,            At Aboukir, saw how the dead men lay;             Charged with the fiercest in Busaco's strife,           Brave dreams are his -- the flick'ring lamp burns low --            Yet couraged for the battles of the day             He goes to stand full face to face with life.     Isandlwana                   _Scarlet coats, and crash o' the band,                 The grey of a pauper's gown,                A soldier's grave in Zululand,                 And a woman in Brecon Town._            My little lad for a soldier boy,            (Mothers o' Brecon Town!)           My eyes for tears and his for joy            When he went from Brecon Town,           His for the flags and the gallant sights           His for the medals and his for the fights,           And mine for the dreary, rainy nights            At home in Brecon Town.            They say he's laid beneath a tree,            (Come back to Brecon Town!)           Shouldn't I know? --  I was there to see:            (It's far to Brecon Town!)           It's me that keeps it trim and drest           With a briar there and a rose by his breast --           The English flowers he likes the best            That I bring from Brecon Town.            And I sit beside him -- him and me,            (We're back to Brecon Town.)           To talk of the things that used to be            (Grey ghosts of Brecon Town);           I know the look o' the land and sky,           And the bird that builds in the tree near by,           And times I hear the jackals cry,            And me in Brecon Town.                 _Golden grey on miles of sand                 The dawn comes creeping down;                It's day in far off Zululand                 And night in Brecon Town._     The Unconquered Dead                 \". . . defeated, with great loss.\"             Not we the conquered!  Not to us the blame            Of them that flee, of them that basely yield;           Nor ours the shout of victory, the fame            Of them that vanquish in a stricken field.            That day of battle in the dusty heat            We lay and heard the bullets swish and sing           Like scythes amid the over-ripened wheat,            And we the harvest of their garnering.            Some yielded, No, not we!  Not we, we swear            By these our wounds; this trench upon the hill           Where all the shell-strewn earth is seamed and bare,            Was ours to keep; and lo! we have it still.            We might have yielded, even we, but death            Came for our helper; like a sudden flood           The crashing darkness fell; our painful breath            We drew with gasps amid the choking blood.            The roar fell faint and farther off, and soon            Sank to a foolish humming in our ears,           Like crickets in the long, hot afternoon            Among the wheat fields of the olden years.            Before our eyes a boundless wall of red            Shot through by sudden streaks of jagged pain!           Then a slow-gathering darkness overhead            And rest came on us like a quiet rain.            Not we the conquered!  Not to us the shame,            Who hold our earthen ramparts, nor shall cease           To hold them ever; victors we, who came            In that fierce moment to our honoured peace.     The Captain            1797                  _Here all the day she swings from tide to tide,                 Here all night long she tugs a rusted chain,                A masterless hulk that was a ship of pride,                 Yet unashamed:  her memories remain._            It was Nelson in the 'Captain', Cape St. Vincent far alee,            With the 'Vanguard' leading s'uth'ard in the haze --           Little Jervis and the Spaniards and the fight that was to be,           Twenty-seven Spanish battleships, great bullies of the sea,            And the 'Captain' there to find her day of days.            Right into them the 'Vanguard' leads, but with a sudden tack            The Spaniards double swiftly on their trail;           Now Jervis overshoots his mark, like some too eager pack,           He will not overtake them, haste he e'er so greatly back,            But Nelson and the 'Captain' will not fail.            Like a tigress on her quarry leaps the 'Captain' from her place,            To lie across the fleeing squadron's way:           Heavy odds and heavy onslaught, gun to gun and face to face,           Win the ship a name of glory, win the men a death of grace,            For a little hold the Spanish fleet in play.            Ended now the \"Captain\"'s battle, stricken sore she falls aside            Holding still her foemen, beaten to the knee:           As the 'Vanguard' drifted past her, \"Well done, 'Captain',\" Jervis cried,           Rang the cheers of men that conquered, ran the blood of men that died,            And the ship had won her immortality.                 _Lo! here her progeny of steel and steam,                 A "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/353"],["title","In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems (#1)"],["body","monster at her mooring swings:                Still, in our hearts, we see her pennant stream,                 And \"Well done, 'Captain',\" like a trumpet rings._     The Song of the Derelict              Ye have sung me your songs, ye have chanted your rimes            (I scorn your beguiling, O sea!)           Ye fondle me now, but to strike me betimes.            (A treacherous lover, the sea!)           Once I saw as I lay, half-awash in the night           A hull in the gloom -- a quick hail -- and a light           And I lurched o'er to leeward and saved her for spite            From the doom that ye meted to me.            I was sister to 'Terrible', seventy-four,            (Yo ho! for the swing of the sea!)           And ye sank her in fathoms a thousand or more            (Alas! for the might of the sea!)           Ye taunt me and sing me her fate for a sign!           What harm can ye wreak more on me or on mine?           Ho braggart!  I care not for boasting of thine --            A fig for the wrath of the sea!            Some night to the lee of the land I shall steal,            (Heigh-ho to be home from the sea!)           No pilot but Death at the rudderless wheel,            (None knoweth the harbor as he!)           To lie where the slow tide creeps hither and fro           And the shifting sand laps me around, for I know           That my gallant old crew are in Port long ago --            For ever at peace with the sea!     Quebec            1608-1908             Of old, like Helen, guerdon of the strong --            Like Helen fair, like Helen light of word, --           \"The spoils unto the conquerors belong.            Who winneth me must win me by the sword.\"            Grown old, like Helen, once the jealous prize            That strong men battled for in savage hate,           Can she look forth with unregretful eyes,            Where sleep Montcalm and Wolfe beside her gate?     Then and Now              Beneath her window in the fragrant night            I half forget how truant years have flown           Since I looked up to see her chamber-light,            Or catch, perchance, her slender shadow thrown           Upon the casement; but the nodding leaves            Sweep lazily across the unlit pane,           And to and fro beneath the shadowy eaves,            Like restless birds, the breath of coming rain           Creeps, lilac-laden, up the village street            When all is still, as if the very trees           Were listening for the coming of her feet            That come no more; yet, lest I weep, the breeze           Sings some forgotten song of those old years           Until my heart grows far too glad for tears.     Unsolved              Amid my books I lived the hurrying years,            Disdaining kinship with my fellow man;           Alike to me were human smiles and tears,            I cared not whither Earth's great life-stream ran,           Till as I knelt before my mouldered shrine,            God made me look into a woman's eyes;           And I, who thought all earthly wisdom mine,            Knew in a moment that the eternal skies           Were measured but in inches, to the quest            That lay before me in that mystic gaze.           \"Surely I have been errant:  it is best            That I should tread, with men their human ways.\"           God took the teacher, ere the task was learned,           And to my lonely books again I turned.     The Hope of My Heart            \"Delicta juventutis et ignorantius ejus,                   quoesumus ne memineris, Domine.\"              I left, to earth, a little maiden fair,            With locks of gold, and eyes that shamed the light;           I prayed that God might have her in His care                       And sight.            Earth's love was false; her voice, a siren's song;            (Sweet mother-earth was but a lying name)           The path she showed was but the path of wrong                       And shame.            \"Cast her not out!\" I cry.  God's kind words come --            \"Her future is with Me, as was her past;           It shall be My good will to bring her home                       At last.\"     Penance             My lover died a century ago,           Her dear heart stricken by my sland'rous breath,           Wherefore the Gods forbade that I should know                       The peace of death.            Men pass my grave, and say, \"'Twere well to sleep,           Like such an one, amid the uncaring dead!\"           How should they know the vigils that I keep,                       The tears I shed?            Upon the grave, I count with lifeless breath,           Each night, each year, the flowers that bloom and die,           Deeming the leaves, that fall to dreamless death,                       More blest than I.            'Twas just last year -- I heard two lovers pass           So near, I caught the tender words he said:           To-night the rain-drenched breezes sway the grass                       Above his head.            That night full envious of his life was I,           That youth and love should stand at his behest;           To-night, I envy him, that he should lie                       At utter rest.     Slumber Songs               I            Sleep, little eyes           That brim with childish tears amid thy play,           Be comforted!  No grief of night can weigh           Against the joys that throng thy coming day.            Sleep, little heart!           There is no place in Slumberland for tears:           Life soon enough will bring its chilling fears           And sorrows that will dim the after years.           Sleep, little heart!               II            Ah, little eyes           Dead blossoms of a springtime long ago,           That life's storm crushed and left to lie below           The benediction of the falling snow!            Sleep, little heart           That ceased so long ago its frantic beat!           The years that come and go with silent feet           Have naught to tell save this -- that rest is sweet.           Dear little heart.     The Oldest Drama                 _\"It fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.                And he said unto his father, My head, my head.  And he said to a lad,                Carry him to his mother.  And . . . he sat on her knees till noon,                and then died.  And she went up, and laid him on the bed. . . .                And shut the door upon him and went out.\"_              Immortal story that no mother's heart            Ev'n yet can read, nor feel the biting pain           That rent her soul!  Immortal not by art            Which makes a long past sorrow sting again            Like grief of yesterday:  but since it said            In simplest word the truth which all may see,           Where any mother sobs above her dead            And plays anew the silent tragedy.     Recompense              I saw two sowers in Life's field at morn,            To whom came one in angel guise and said,           \"Is it for labour that a man is born?            Lo:  I am Ease.  Come ye and eat my bread!\"           Then gladly one forsook his task undone            And with the Tempter went his slothful way,           The other toiled until the setting sun            With stealing shadows blurred the dusty day.            Ere harvest time, upon earth's peaceful breast            Each laid him down among the unreaping dead.           \"Labour hath other recompense than rest,            Else were the toiler like the fool,\" I said;           \"God meteth him not less, but rather more           Because he sowed and others reaped his store.\"     Mine Host              There stands a hostel by a travelled way;            Life is the road and Death the worthy host;           Each guest he greets, nor ever lacks to say,            \"How have ye fared?\"  They answer him, the most,           \"This lodging place is other than we sought;            We had intended farther, but the gloom           Came on apace, and found us ere we thought:            Yet will we lodge.  Thou hast abundant room.\"            Within sit haggard men that speak no word,            No fire gleams their cheerful welcome shed;           No voice of fellowship or strife is heard            But silence of a multitude of dead.           \"Naught can I offer ye,\" quoth Death, \"but rest!\"           And to his chamber leads each tired guest.     Equality              I saw a King, who spent his life to weave            Into a nation all his great heart thought,           Unsatisfied until he should achieve            The grand ideal that his manhood sought;           Yet as he saw the end within his reach,            Death took the sceptre from his failing hand,           And all men said, \"He gave his life to teach            The task of honour to a sordid land!\"           Within his gates I saw, through all those years,            One at his humble toil with cheery face,           Whom (being dead) the children, half in tears,            Remembered oft, and missed him from his place.           If he be greater that his people blessed           Than he the children loved, God knoweth best.     Anarchy              I saw a city filled with lust and shame,            Where men, like wolves, slunk through the grim half-light;           And sudden, in the midst of it, there came            One who spoke boldly for the cause of Right.            And speaking, fell before that brutish race            Like some poor wren that shrieking eagles tear,           While brute Dishonour, with her bloodless face            Stood by and smote his lips that moved in prayer.            \"Speak not of God!  In centuries that word            Hath not been uttered!  Our own king are we.\"           And God stretched forth his finger as He heard            And o'er it cast a thousand leagues of sea.
