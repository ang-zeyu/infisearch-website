GALBREATH   In the summer of 1946 a party from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History visited exposures of the Laverne formation in Beaver County, Oklahoma, at the invitation of Dr. Stuart Schoff of the United States Geological Survey. When examining the marl beds an Emydid turtle was discovered which appears to be an unnamed species of the genus _Chrysemys_. A description of the new species follows.                      Chrysemys limnodytes, new species    _Holotype._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History No.   7676, vertebrate paleontological collection, a turtle consisting of   a fragmental anterior portion of a carapace, left part of the   plastron, and several marginals collected by the 1946   paleontological field party of the University of Kansas Museum of   Natural History.    _Geological Age and locality._--Marl beds of the Laverne formation,   early Pliocene age, in SW 1/4 Sec. 15, T. 4 N., R. 25 ECM, Beaver   County, Oklahoma. The specimen was removed from the marl   immediately below the fossil leaf zone (see Chaney and Elias, 1936;   Frye and Hibbard, 1940).    _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements) and differing from   other species of _Chrysemys_ in having: The anterior end of the   carapace broadly concave, the posterolateral marginals not greatly   flared, the posterior end of the plastron broadly indented, the   carapace more sculptured and relatively wider.  _Description of type._--The specimen had been badly damaged before preservation, and had suffered further damage from exposure before discovery. The anterior and posterior lobes of the plastron had been folded over the bridge, forming a three-ply thickness of bone. Of the carapace, only the following parts are known: Fragment of the nuchal; right 1st, 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals, left 1st, 2d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th marginals; costals 1-5 on the right side; costals 1-4 on the left side; and 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th neurals. The left half of the plastron is relatively complete, lacking only the epiplastron and entoplastron. The left 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are joined to the plastron at the inguinal buttress, and the right 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are attached to the fifth costal. The carapace has smooth contours with no keel present, but on the lower half of the costals there are seven or eight ridges, and the remaining surface of the costals and neurals are rugose. The marginals lack ridges, and the posterolateral marginals are not serrated. The anterior end of the carapace has a broad shallow notch. The first neural is rounded, and the 2d, 3d, and 4th are hexagonal, with the broad ends forward. Anterior margins of the 2d and 3d neurals are concave, and the anterior margin of the 4th neural is straight.  The sulci bounding the scutes are moderately impressed. The width of the first vertebral scute, anteriorly and posteriorly, is less than the width of the second vertebral scute. The costal scutes join the marginal scutes on the marginal plates.  The plastron, broadly indented at the posterior end, does not have the posterior lobe flared laterally as it is in Recent species of _Chrysemys_, and lacks any pronounced notch at the femoro-anal suture. The humero-pectoral sulcus crosses the plastron behind the entoplastron in a straight line, and reaches the border anterior to the axillary notch. The pectoro-abdominal suture is anteriorly convex at the sides and concave at the midline.  A comparison of this carapace and plastron with a series of specimens of Recent _Chrysemys picta_ and _Pseudemys scripta_ of approximately the same size reveals characters indicated in the following chart:    ==================================================================    RECENT _Chrysemys_ | _Chrysemys limnodytes_ | RECENT _Pseudemys_   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Not serrated.       | Posterolateral         | Serrated.                       | marginals not serrated.|   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Not notched.        | Carapace with broad    | Notched.                       | shallow notch at       |                       | anterior end.          |   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Occasional faint    | Plastron does not have | Distinct notch at   notch at femoro-anal| a pronounced notch at  | femoro-anal suture.   suture.             | femoro-anal suture.    |   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Posterior lobe of   | Posterior lobe of      | Posterior lobe of   plastron flares     | plastron does not      | plastron does not   laterally.          | flare laterally.       | flare laterally.   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Carapace smooth.    | Carapace has smooth    | Carapace has                       | contours.              | depressions and                       |                        | elevations.   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Old specimens       | Seven or eight ridges  | Ridges cover   occasionally have   | on lower half of       | costals.   five or six ridges  | costals.               |   near border of      | Remaining surface of   |   costals.            | costals and neurals    |                       | rugose.                |   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   No ridges on        | No ridges on           | May or may not   marginals.          | marginals.             | have ridges on                       |                        | marginals.   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Nuchal smooth.      | Nuchal smooth.         | Nuchal has ridges.   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Carapace not        | Probably arched less   | Greatly arched.   greatly arched.     | than in _Pseudemys_,   |                       | but more than in any   |                       | Recent _Chrysemys_.    |   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Keel often present  | No keel present.       | Keel often present.   at birth, but soon  |                        |   lost.               |                        |   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Anterior and        | Anterior and posterior | Anterior width of   posterior widths of | widths of first        | first vertebral   first vertebral     | vertebral scute less   | scute less than   scute approximately | than width of second   | posterior width,   same as width of    | vertebral scute.       | or both dimensions   second vertebral    |                        | less than width of   scute.              |                        | second vertebral                       |                        | scute.   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------   Ribs do not tend    | Ribs not prominent on  | Ribs tend to be   to be prominent on  | costals.               | prominent on   costals.            |                        | costals.   --------------------+------------------------+--------------------  Hay attached considerable taxonomic importance to the characters of the nuchal and I find its characters to be fairly constant in the specimens of Emydidae examined. Although the nuchal of _Chrysemys limnodytes_ is incomplete, it can be distinguished from the nuchals described by Hay as types of his several fossil Emydids. Differences in the nuchal, together with those in the carapace and plastron, serve to distinguish the species from other genera of the Emydidae.  When the specimen is compared with _Chrysemys timida_ Hay, of the Nebraska Pleistocene, many similarities, mostly of generic rank, are seen. _Chrysemys limnodytes_ is broader in relation to length than is either _C. timida_ or any Recent specimen examined of the same size. The greatest allowance possible in estimating the length of _C. limnodytes_ fails to bring the ratio of its breadth to length within the range of Recent specimens of similar size. Data from 96 specimens of Recent _Chrysemys picta_ show that the ratio of length to width is not affected by sex, but that the ratio does vary with the age of the specimen. In young animals the length and width are approximately equal, but with further growth the length becomes relatively greater. Specimens in the length group of 135 to 144 mm. have the widths ranging from 71 to 81 per cent of the lengths. In all specimens larger than"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34449"],["title","A New Extinct Emydid Turtle from the Lower Pliocene of Oklahoma (#1)"],["body","s, the ratio is in the low seventies, and the largest specimen, 177 mm. in length, has the width of the carapace amounting to only 74 per cent of the length. The fossil species, _C. timida_, with a length of 160 mm., has the width amounting to 75 per cent of the length, and _C. limnodytes_, with an estimated length of 180 mm., has the width amounting to 80.5 per cent of the length. _C. timida_ is widest anteriorly, whereas _C. limnodytes_ and the other species of the genus are widest posteriorly. Less obvious differences between the two fossils are the narrower anterior margin of the nuchal, the concave anterior end of the carapace, the sculptured surface of the carapace, and the relatively wider neurals and longer vertebrals of _C. limnodytes_.

However, any resemblance to _Pseudemys_ is not to be considered as evidence that _C. limnodytes_ is in any way ancestral to the genus _Pseudemys_. The fossil specimens of _Pseudemys_ from the Pliocene are too poorly known to allow the student certainly to place them in their correct systematic positions. The fossil Emydids from Western Europe, listed as species of _Chrysemys_, differ very much from this species, or belong to other genera of the family.  Only a few turtles are known from the Laverne formation. Hesse (Chaney and Elias, 1936) reported a small _Testudo_ from the Laverne of Beaver County, Oklahoma, but neglected to state whether it was among the material borrowed by him from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. The Museum has an incomplete carapace and plastron (No. 3101) of a small _Testudo_ from that locality and formation. In Harper County, Oklahoma, the field party from the University recovered a large number of fragments of a large _Testudo_. Although this specimen is as yet unprepared, enough fragments have been pieced together to reveal that the tibia is 127 mm. long. This dimension and those of some of the fragments indicate that the animal may have been four to five feet long.  Mrs. Bernita Mansfield of the Geology Department, University of Kansas, prepared the plate.     LITERATURE CITED   BERGOUNIOUX, FREDERIC-MARIE.    1935.
