But the sun came out again all over Mrs Cripps's face, and dissipated the cloud that was lending gloom to the festive morn; whispering words of comfort to the stricken couple, Mrs Thornypath brightened up; and Hez, passive as a child, let them lead him to the table, where the old lady presiding beamed upon them all during the repast.  But it was Christmas-day, and Mrs Cripps's plans had not yet reached fruition; so, after the breakfast, she retired with Mrs Thornypath into a corner, where, during a long discussion, the latter lady seemed trying to beg off some arrangement that the other was proposing; but she was speedily conquered by her energetic adversary, who, watching her opportunity, attacked poor Mrs Thornypath in her weakest point, and carried the day by saying it would \"do the dear children good.\"  Mrs Thornypath then crossed over to her husband, who was leaning against the mantel-piece, and whispered with him for a minute; when he, poor fellow, glancing at his clothes, sorrowfully shook his head.  But it was of no use; Mrs Cripps reinforced the attacking party, and poor Hez, completely beaten, gave a silent acquiescence to their entreaties.  There was now a busy interval of preparation, when a heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs.  Hez gave an involuntary shiver as a loud rap was heard at the door, and then, without waiting for an answer, in stalked a stout, red-faced woman--the landlady--who, having gained scent of the new friend who appeared upon the scene, thought this a favourable opportunity for renewing her importunities.  She had come with a speech all ready made up, and began:--  \"Now, Mr Thornypath, about this here rent?\"  Hez was about to reply, when Mrs Cripps confronted the intruder, and with the most cutting politeness said, \"Pray, mum, have you brought your receipt?\"  This was hardly what the landlady had prepared herself for, so she replied in the negative, when Mrs Cripps, with the same show of politeness, requested her to fetch it; and after backing the red-faced woman out, stood waiting her return; for Mrs Cripps was ready to face twenty Mrs Prodgers, and give them all a bit of her mind.  This feeling was also strongly shared by the lady in question, who had determined also to make the second floor back a present of the above popular portion of a quarrelsome person's thinking apparatus; but upon her return, very much out of breath with her ascent, in spite of Hez's remonstrances, she was paid in full, and before a sufficiency of lung inflation had taken place, the closing door cut short all attempts at recrimination.  Mrs Prodgers was one of that class of householders who so abound in our thickly-populated neighbourhoods.  She took a house with the intention of making all she could out of it, and not such a very unbusiness-like proceeding after all.  But it is the cause of a vast amount of misery amongst those who are compelled to seek a house close to their daily avocation.  They are obliged to live upon the spot, and so, in the scarcity of abodes, pay whatever rent is demanded, always a most exorbitant one, and this they contrive to pay while work holds out, but the first drawback places them at the tender mercies of their Mrs Prodgers, when their life becomes a burden, and too often that most real of all distresses, a distress for rent, sweeps away the little hardly-gained furniture.  In many cases, however, Mrs Prodgers, through her over-reaching, finds that her tenants have left suddenly, leaving \"not a wrack behind.\"  Would it not be better to receive a moderate and well-paid refit?  A boy out of the first-floor back soon fetched a hackney coach, and into it Mrs Cripps hurried all her party, to be conveyed by her to the \"Gravel Pits.\"  There was plenty of delicacy, too, in the old dame, for she could not see anything upon the journey but the children, nor attend to anything but their wants, and so by degrees Hez's shame and wounded pride, that so far had covered him with an icy reserve, melted before the genial dame.  The bright morning, and the merry faces of his children, listening to the details of the pudding that awaited them, these, too, tended to bring to his remembrance the dream of the previous night, and to show him that one loving, honest heart on earth was more than a match for despair.  The streets were full of happy faces, and to Hez's eye everything appeared already to wear a brighter aspect.  \"Try again\" seemed to ring in his ears, and during a temporary stoppage the greeting of one rosy-faced old man to another, \"Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you, my boy,\" seemed to thrill through him.  Why should it not be a happy new year to him too?  And with the thought the saddening, vacant, helpless look vanished from his countenance, driven away by the spirit of energy and determination; his carriage became more erect, and this unwonted aspect was communicated to her who had divided with him the troubles of the past.  Mrs Cripps still kept too busy on the front seat with the children to observe what passed opposite, but somehow or other a very large tear trickled slowly down her nose, until it descended \"plash\" upon the hand of the child she held in her lap, making the little thing ask in her wonderment \"what made it yain there?\"  There was too much to point out to the children for any notice to be taken of what took place, and when at last Hez and his wife each held out a hand to the dame, the former felt that there was no cause to fear humiliation, for the hearty, honest pressure, accompanied as it was by the motherly, loving smile, showed the full extent of the existing sympathy, and how little need there was for wordy thanks.  FOUR--THE SUN'S INFLUENCE.  There never was such a goose before! never--brown, crimply, fragrant, and luscious, as--as--as--there; nothing else will compare with it-- luscious as roast goose.  The cooking too: one turn more would, nay must, have spoiled it; and as to the consequences of one turn less, they were not to be thought of.  It was just, to do Mary justice, \"done to a turn,\" and Mrs Cripps was put out of her misery; for, as she had told Mrs Hez in confidence, she had had her doubts; but they were all cleared up, and the old lady's face shone and looked for all the world like the pippins that had composed the sauce.  Such mashed potatoes, beautifully worked all over the surface into elegant designs with a fork, and showing brown where they had been to the fire; while just under Hez's nose, and sending forth a maddening jet of steam, was a tureen full of supplementary gravy, and sage and onions, in case the great levy that lay within the internal regions of the goose should fail.  There was a big brown jug of the brownest stout; bread of the whitest; greens of the greenest; and the table had all the best cut glass on, so as to give the effect to Mrs Cripps's six silver table-spoons.  There was a real oak Christmas log upon the fire, crackling away and sending whole regiments of soldiers flying up the chimney, when poked for the gratification of little Goldenhair.  Hez's eldest child, too, had had a peep in the sideboard cupboard, where there were oranges, apples, figs, nuts, decanters, and all sorts of unheard-of treasures.  But at last the whole party were settled at the table; Mr and Mrs Hez top and bottom, and Mrs Cripps and the children taking the posts of the visitors.  There never was such a goose before.  \"Ciss-s-s-s\" at the first plunge of the carving-knife a fountain of rich brown gravy spurted right across the snow-white table-cloth, and right into the salt-cellar; and then there was such scraping and rubbing up of the mess, only ending in making bad doubly worse; but at last the carver's duty was well performed, the choice morsels distributed, and Mrs Cripps idle, from the fact that she really could not force more mashed potatoes or gravy upon anyone.  At last, when summoned, Mrs Cripps's Mary came in to change the plates, and brought with her such a fragrant scent as could only have belonged to a Christmas pudding; and, sure enough, it directly afterwards made its appearance, with sides bursting open to disclose the richness within.  It had been on the boil for six hours; and what with the piece of holly stuck in the top, and the wine-glassful of brandy set blazing in the dish, there never could have been such a luxurious pudding before.  As to the children, they again clapped their hands with delight, but otherwise gave silent testimony of their admiration by being helped three times, and eating as only children can eat pudding.  But the best of dinners must have a termination, and so did this one; and when the hearth had been swept up, and the treasures of the cupboard shone upon the little table; and whilst the fire-light danced in golden hues within the old-fashioned decanters, full of old-fashioned home-made wine, the chairs being all drawn up round the fire, Mrs Cripps began to tell her visitors of her savings; and how that she had two hundred pounds in the bank; and it not being likely that she would want it for many years to come, it was her wish that Hez--\"dear Master Hez\"--should take it to begin the world with afresh, and pay his old nurse again when he could spare it.  And when Hez and his wife would not hear of such a thing, the old woman grew quite angry, and took the upper hand, saying, \"that they were children and ought not to dictate to an old body of her years, and that she would do what she liked with her own money,\" and last of all pretended to get in such a passion, that the visitors were obliged to be silent.  At last, when the early winter's eve was closing in, when the ferny foliage began to appear upon the frosty panes, and before the candles were lighted, Mrs Cripps, who had been for a long time very"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34665"],["title","Christmas Penny Readings: Original Sketches for the Season (#4)"],["body","ilent, suddenly asked Hez if he remembered the story he used to read her, years ago, out of his little book, about the mouse helping the lion out of the net.  Hez replied in the affirmative, and saw again within the glowing fire the image of his tiny, bygone self, perched upon a tall chair, reading to his comely nurse.  While his nurse, old, but comely still, fondly putting her hand upon his shoulder, reminded him, too, of the dreary Christmas-eve when she had come to his father's house--to her old master--wet, cold, and weary with her long walk from the distant village; how that weeping and sobbing she had come to beg the stern old man to lend her money to save her husband from ruin, and their little home from being broken up; how that Hez's father had refused--harshly refused--saying that he had too many ways for his money to waste it in helping idle people; and how, when turning heartsick to the door, a little hand had seized hold of old nurse's gown, telling nurse not to cry, for Hez would give her all his money; and forthwith thrust his little box, containing two new pennies and a lucky sixpence, into her hands, setting her weeping more bitterly than ever; bringing her upon her knees by his side to sob over and kiss the noble-hearted little fellow, till a stern voice had called him away; but only to come rushing after her again with the money she sought clasped in his little hands. \"And,\" concluded the dame, once more sinking upon her knees by the side of Hez, \"I thank God that I can show my dear boy how many years I have remembered his kind--kind act!\"  It was growing very dark in the little parlour, and Mary was getting very impatient to bring in the tea-things; but her patience was tried for some time longer, and when at last, unsummoned, she took them in, and lit the candles, the children had fallen asleep upon the sofa, and \"missus's\" eyes looked very red.  FIVE--WHAT FOLLOWED.  Hez had found the long lane had a turning in it at last, and the roadway of that turning was smooth and easy to travel upon--so easy that he soon left all the frost and thaw far behind, and got well on in his journey of life.  He used to say that a blessing went with old nurse Cripps's money, for success attended his every venture with it.  He is now a man of some note in his little country-town; and it is a fact patent to all that a helping hand can always be found with Hezekiah Thornypath by those who merit it.  I spent a few days with him at Christmas-time, some three or four years since, and there, in the snuggest corner of the room, sat a very old, white-haired dame, pretending to be very busy knitting, propped up in her easy-chair, with one or another of Hez's numerous youngsters on the watch to pick up the constantly-straying worsted and needles.  There was always a smile upon the old lady's face when any such act was performed for her--a smile that grew brighter still when Hez approached to say a few words.  Christmas-night had come, and a merry day had been spent.  The old lady had smiled and looked pleased when Hez talked of never having been able to get such another goose as nurse Cripps gave them that day, years ago, for dinner; and that, for all his money, he had never seen such a pudding upon his table as the one he partook of at Kensington.  She had sat in state, too, while having her health drunk by all the family; and feebly she bent forward to \"wish Master Hez a merry Christmas.\"  At last the party was collected round the fire, the evening was fast giving way to night, and quiet conversation was taking the place of the merry laughter and games of the afternoon.  Hez and his wife sat on either side of Mrs Cripps, and had risen to once more wish the dame \"a merry Christmas\" before she left them for her early-sought couch.  They had been talking of bygones; and, sitting with a hand grasped by those she had loved so long, the poor old lady suddenly lifted herself up, but only to fall back again in her chair as though asleep.  In the midst of the excitement, I aided Hez to carry her to her room, where she lay for days just gently breathing, but never again conscious. Watched night and day by loving friends, she passed away without a sigh during the still hours of the old year's death, with only a growing chill to show that her sleep had deepened in intensity, and that here she would wake no more.    CHAPTER TWO.  CORNS.  \"Diet, sir; Diet, decidedly.  Now you'll take this to John Bell's, in Oxford Street, and they'll make up the prescription; then you'll go on to Gilbey's--crooked-looking place, you know; just as if they'd built the house somewhere else, and then when they wanted to put it in its place found it too big, and had to squeeze it in.  Well, there you'll order a few dozens of their light dinner claret.  No more '20 port or fiery sherry.  Taboo, sir, taboo.  Light wine in moderation.  Diet, sir, diet.  _Good_ morning.\"  I looked at the bristly-headed physician, who handed me a sheet of note paper with a big capital B, two long blurs, a rough blotch, a few spidery ink splays, and an ugly MD at the end of a few inky hooks-and-eyes, which I received in return for the twenty-one shillings I left upon the table; and then muttering the one word \"diet,\" I stood in the hall upon a horrible stony-looking piece of floorcloth that quite struck cold up my legs.  Here I was confronted by the footman who ushered me into his master's presence--a blue-coated, crestless-buttoned wretch with two round grey eyes that said \"shillings\" as plainly as any mute thing could; but I was angry, and determined to come no more: so giving the fellow only a sixpence, I hobbled away and stood in Saville Row.  Diet, indeed; why no man could be more moderate.  And what's half a bottle of port for one's dinner?  Why, my grandfather, sir, took his two bottles regularly, and, beyond an occasional fit of the gout, was as hale a man as ever lived.  Why, he'd have lived till fourscore safe if bad management and country doctors had not drawn the regal complaint into his stomach, where it would stop.  This was coming to a physician for advice.  And then what did he do when I told him of the agonies I suffered?--smiled pleasantly, and said it was my liver; while when I hinted at my corns, what did he do then but metaphorically tread upon them, for he laughed.  Now, putting dyspepsia on one side, I appeal to my fellow-sufferers, and ask them, Is there any torture to be compared with the infliction of corns?  Headache?--take a little medicine and lie down.  Toothache?-- have it out.  Earache?--try hot onion.  Opodeldoc for rheumatism; chlorodyne for tic; colchicum for gout.  There's a remedy for nearly every pain and ache; but what will you do for your corns?  Ordinary sufferings come only now and then, but corns shoot, stab, twitch, and agonise continually.  What is the remedy?  Plasters are puffs; bandages empty promises; the knife threatens tetanus; caustic only makes them black and smarting; while chiropodists--.  Mention them not in my hearing, lest my vengeance fall upon your devoted head.  Where can you put your feet to be safe--at home or abroad?  Why, your very boots are sworn enemies, and the battle at putting on or pulling off makes the thought of the operation produce beads of cold perspiration upon one's ample brow.  Who can be surprised at one's lying long in bed of a morning when tortures await, and you know that just outside the door, by the side of the large white jug whose water grows less and less steamy, there stand two hollow leather cylinders loaded with fearful pains to be discharged at your devoted feet.  There isn't a sensible shoemaker on the face of the earth.  I've tried them one after the other until I'm tired of them.  One recommends calf, another kid, another dog-skin, and another \"pannus corium,\" and my feet are worse than ever.  I won't believe in them any more, though they do show me lasts made to my feet, and insult me with hideous nubbly, bunkly abortions carved in wood, which they say represent my feet--my feet, those suffering locomotives.  I'll take to sandals, or else follow the advice of the Countess de Noailles, and go barefoot like the old hen in the nursery rhyme.  I could suffer the bodily pain if it were not for the mental accompaniment, and the total want of pity and compassion shown by people.  Only the other day, going down one of those quiet cab-stand streets, one of the idle wretches that I intended to engage shouted out to his companions,--  \"I say, old 'uns, here's Peter Pindar a-coming.\"  \"Who?\" shouted another.  \"Cove as turned pilgrim, and went with peas in his shoes,\" cried Number One; while, writhing with agony, and gnashing my teeth, I shook my stick at the rascal.  \"You scoundrel,\" I cried, \"it's my corn,--it's not peas.\"  \"Then get it ground, sir,\" groaned the fellow; when I was so vexed that I took the omnibus instead, or rather the omnibus took me, and as soon as I had entered, I was shot into the lap of a stout elderly lady who looked daggers at me, and revenged herself by putting her fat umbrella ferrule on my corn at every opportunity.  I believe it was Mrs Saunders herself, the friend of Mrs Bardell, of Goswell Street.  And oh! what I suffered in that vehicle!  Would that I could have performed the operation recommended by the conductor--a man with a gash across his face when he laughed--to put my toes in my pocket, or go and dispose of my troubles at Mark Lane.  It was of no use to try: every one who came in or went out of that 'bus, either trod upon or poked my worst corn with stick or umbrella, and then in the height of my anguish, when my countenance was distorted with pain, a stout, wheezing old lady opposite must \"Drat my imperance,\" and want to know whether I meant to insult her.  I hobbled out of the place of torture as quickly as I could, and stepped into one of those mud trimmings the scavengers delight in leaving by our pavements, covering the glossy leather with the"]]]
