Part of skeleton of _Bombycilla cedrorum_                  showing method of measuring the length of the trunk.                  Natural size.]   _Leg-trunk Percentages._--Table 4 shows the relative lengths of the legs and of the separate bones in the legs of the different species of the Bombycillids. Table 5 shows corresponding lengths for other passerine birds. The total length of the leg was computed by adding the figures obtained for the lengths of the femur, tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus. The lengths of the toes were disregarded. Length of leg was recorded in this same way by Richardson (1942:333), who thought that only in swimming and running birds do the toes contribute to the functional length of the hind limb.  Table 4 shows that of the birds compared in this paper, _Dulus_ has the longest legs. In order of decreasing length the others are the Ptilogonatinae, and finally the Bombycillinae, which have the shortest legs of all. In Waxwings the length of the legs, expressed as percentages of the body-lengths, are identical with those birds that are similar in habits, that is to say, birds which do not use the hind limb except in perching. It can be noted by reference to Table 5 that _Tachycineta_ and _Myadestes_ fall into this category. This shortness of limb is obviously adaptive, and each of the segments of the limb has been correspondingly shortened, with no element reduced at the expense of the other two. The short leg can be more easily folded against the body while the bird is in flight, than can a long leg which is more unwieldy. It may be noted from tables 4 and 5 that birds which spend much time on the ground, or that hop a great deal in the underbrush, have longer legs than do birds which spend much time in flight. Two birds with noticeably long legs are _Hylocichla mustelina_, a typical ground dweller, and _Parus atricapillus_, which hops about in the trees and underbrush.  Insofar as the lengths of the legs show, _Dulus_ and _Phainoptila_ are the most generalized of the Bombycillidae, since the relative length of leg is approximately the same as that of more generalized birds such as warblers, crows and thrushes of similar locomotory habits. In other words, _Dulus_ and _Phainoptila_ have remained unspecialized, in contrast to the waxwings in which adaptive changes fitting them for a perching habit have taken place. _Ptilogonys_ and _Phainopepla_ are intermediate in length of leg between _Phainoptila_ and _Bombycilla_, and _Ptilogonys_ and _Phainopepla_ have progressed from life on the ground toward the perching habit. _Bombycilla cedrorum_ is more specialized than is _B. garrula_ in shortness of leg, and the reduction is comparable, as is noted above, to that in the legs of _Tachycineta_.  In birds which have the legs much modified for walking or for hopping in the brush, such as _Polioptila_ and _Eremophila_, it is noteworthy that the distal segment, the tarsometatarsus, is the longest, whereas in birds such as _Myiarchus_ and _Tachycineta_, that do not utilize the limbs in this manner, the tibiotarsus, the middle segment, is the longest. Mammals much modified for walking or hopping likewise have the proximal segment, the femur, short, and the distal segment long (Howell, 1944). The waxwings have all of the segments short; these birds are modified for strong and sustained flight. Their hind limbs are used principally for landing devices and for perching. No one element of the leg has been shortened much, if any, more than any other.     [Illustration: Fig. 44. Graph showing relative lengths of bones of                  the leg.

Table 3 gives the corresponding lengths for birds other than the Bombycillidae. Total length of arm was obtained by adding together the lengths of the humerus, ulna, and manus, and by dividing the figure thus obtained by the length of the trunk as was done for leg lengths in tables 4 and 5. The method of adding together the component parts does not give the entire length of the wing, since the length of the feathers, which add effectively to the total length, as well as do the lengths of the small carpal elements, is lacking.     [Illustration: Figs. 45-46. Outlines of wings. × 1/2      45. _Ptilogonys caudatus_, showing relation of outline of wing         to bones of arm.      46. _Bombycilla cedrorum_, showing relation of outline of wing         to bones of arm.]   It may be noted that _Phainoptila_ and _Bombycilla_ have the shortest arm in the family Bombycillidae. The humerus, radius and ulna are comparable to the same elements in thrushes and the catbird, and it is only the extremely short manus in _Phainoptila_ that affects the total. The manus in _Phainoptila_ is comparatively smaller than in any other genus of the family Bombycillidae, and this indicates poor flight power. _Bombycilla_ has a total length corresponding closely to that in warblers, but the lengths of the distal elements correspond closely to those in the catbird and thrushes. Of the three segments, the humerus is, relatively, the most shortened. Next in order of increasing length of arm is _Dulus_; measurements for it are roughly the same as those of _Myadestes_. The wing bones of the Ptilogonatinae, other than _Phainoptila_, are the longest in this series, and they most nearly resemble the same bones in flycatchers, Parids, and gnatcatchers.     [Illustration: Fig. 47. Graph showing relative lengths of bones of                  the arm. The percentage values are shown on the axis                  of the ordinates.

Those birds with rounded and short wings have the longest humeri. In swallows, for example, the humerus is short, whereas the other arm bones are long, and the manus is unusually large and heavy. A short humerus gives better lever action in the flight stroke than a long humerus does.     MUSCULATURE   Dissections showed the same muscles to be present in all genera of the Bombycillidae. There are, nevertheless, differences in the size of the muscles in the various species, and these differences have been investigated primarily as a check on differences noted in the structure of the bones. Even slight differences in mass can be important functionally, but the difficulty in accurately measuring the mass prevents wholly reliable conclusions. The method first used in the attempt to determine the mass of a given muscle was that of immersing the muscle in a liquid-filled graduated tube, and then measuring the amount of liquid displaced. This method, although adequate for large muscles, was subject to a great amount of error in the case of small muscles, and consequently was abandoned. The technique eventually used was that previously employed by Richardson (1942). It consisted of dissecting out the muscle, placing it in embalming solution, leaving it there until a later period, and finally, weighing the muscle on scales, accurate to a milligram, after the muscle had been out of the liquid for a period of one minute. After being weighed, the muscle was measured by the displacement method in a graduated tube, as a check. The results indicate that, although the two methods give the same general results, weighing is accurate to one-hundredth of a gram, whereas the displacement method was accurate to only a tenth of a gram.  In determining the percentage of the weight of a muscle in relation to the total weight of the bird, the weight of the muscle was used as the numerator, and the weight of the preserved specimen was used as the denominator. Before weights were taken, all specimens were plucked in identical fashion.   _Caudal Muscles._--The muscles of the caudal area that were used for comparison were the levator caudae and the lateralis caudae. These muscles are used by the living bird to maintain the position of the pygostyle and therefore the rectrices; these muscles are especially important to those birds that utilize the tail as a rudder in flight and as a brake. As may be seen by reference to Table 11, the two muscles are largest in proportion to body weight in the Ptilogonatinae, in which subfamily the species have long rectrices and must have correspondingly well-developed muscles in order to utilize the rectrices to best advantage in flight. The lateralis caudae differs more according to species than does the levator caudae, showing that rudder action of the tail is of primary importance in the adaptation for capturing insects. It will be remembered that the pygostyle in this subfamily has a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34568"],["title","Johann Sebastian Bach : The story of the boy who sang in the streets (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                      CHILD'S OWN BOOK                           _of Great Musicians_                                    BACH                               [Illustration]                                    _By_                              THOMAS TAPPER                            THEODORE PRESSER CO.                           1712 CHESTNUT STREET                              ·PHILADELPHIA·                              Johann Sebastian Bach                            The Story of the Boy                         Who Sang in the Streets                           This Book was made by              ...............................................

[Illustration: THE HOUSE IN WHICH BACH WAS BORN.]  This house stands in the town of Eisenach in Germany. It looks very much the same today as it did when Sebastian was a little boy. Many people go there to visit this house because the little boy grew to be a famous man.  In Eisenach there is a statue of Bach near the palace.                [Illustration: STATUE OF BACH AT EISENACH.]  In the same town in which Sebastian was born there stands on the top of a hill a very famous castle built many hundreds of years ago.  This castle is called the Wartburg.                  [Illustration: THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG.]  As a boy little Sebastian used to climb the hill with his friends, and they, no doubt, had a happy time playing about the castle grounds. In one of its great halls the minstrels of Germany held their Song Contests.  When Sebastian was old enough he used to travel afoot, just as the minstrels did; his purpose was to go to hear fine organ players. Once as he sat weary by the roadside someone threw a herring to him so that he might eat as he rested.                  [Illustration: BACH EATING THE HERRING.]  Little Sebastian's father was named JOHANN AMBROSIUS BACH. He, too, was a musician, as his people had been for many years.                   [Illustration: JOHANN AMBROSIUS BACH.]  One of these was a miller who played and sang while the corn was grinding. His name was Veit Bach, and his little boy was called Hans, the Player, because he, too, loved to play the violin.                [Illustration: VEIT BACH AND HIS SON HANS.]  When Sebastian was ten years old his father and mother died. So he went to live with his brother, whose home was a few miles away.  Of this brother Sebastian had music lessons, and he improved so rapidly that he used to beg to be allowed to play the pieces in a big book in the library.  But the brother refused him this pleasure. However, little Sebastian was eager to learn all the music he could find, so he used to sit up on moonlight nights and copy these pages while his brother was asleep.  But what do you think happened when he had copied everything in that big book?  His brother found out what he had done and took all his precious music away from him.              [Illustration: BACH COPYING MUSIC BY MOONLIGHT.]  If you know any boy who is about twenty years old you may say to him, Bach was as old as you are when Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston.  And although there was this difference of twenty years or so in their ages, we may think of them at work in the world at the same time. You must remember that all men like Franklin and Bach who became famous did so by working very hard.                     [Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.]  Franklin, too, was born very poor. Once he walked the streets of Philadelphia with a loaf of bread under each arm. But by being faithful in all he did he became the friend of all his countrymen and of Kings and Queens besides.  Benjamin Franklin was quite a little younger than Sebastian Bach. But there was a famous man who was almost exactly Sebastian's age. This man composed an Oratorio that is loved by everybody. It is sung in cities and towns all over the world, particularly at Christmas time.  Do you happen to know the name of this Oratorio? If not, you can surely learn it by asking someone or by looking it up in a book.  Write in the name of the composer of this Oratorio below the picture, and write on this line the name of the Oratorio itself.              ...............................................                               [Illustration]  The composer's name is              ...............................................  The Oratorio, the name of which you have just written, was first sung in the Irish city of Dublin, 1742.  At that time Sebastian Bach was living in Leipsic and had been for many years at the head of the Thomas School. He was known as its Cantor. Bach worked very hard here to supply music for several of the Leipsic churches, and he worked so well that his fame spread until it reached the ears of the Emperor.  Frederick the Great was also a musician and composer. So he invited Sebastian Bach to visit him at his castle. There were many people present, but Sebastian Bach was the principal guest. He played on many of the Emperor's fine pianos. When he reached home again he composed a musical work and dedicated it to the Emperor.          [Illustration: BACH PLAYING BEFORE FREDERICK THE GREAT.]  The kind of a piano that Sebastian Bach played on was not called a piano in his day. It was called a Clavier or Clavichord.  Some day you will study a collection of pieces by Sebastian Bach which was written for this instrument and was called _The Well Tempered Clavichord_.  This is the kind of piano, or clavichord, that Bach used.                      [Illustration: THE CLAVICHORD.]  And here is the beginning of the very first piece in the collection of which we have just spoken in Bach's handwriting.                    [Illustration: BACH'S HANDWRITING.]   [Illustration: MORNING PRAYERS IN THE HOME OF JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH.]  Sebastian Bach had a very large family, twenty children altogether. Two of them studied music faithfully with their father.  One was Friedmann, for whom the father wrote a book called _Little Preludes_. Friedmann's brother, Philipp Emanuel Bach, was a very fine clavichord player. He wrote a book about music and composed many pieces.       [Illustration: WILLIAM FRIEDMANN BACH. PHILIPP EMANUEL BACH.]  Sebastian Bach died in 1750. He was sixty-five years of age.  Benjamin Franklin was at that time forty-four years old and George Washington was eighteen.  This is the way Bach wrote his name.                               [Illustration]                         FACTS ABOUT SEBASTIAN BACH.
