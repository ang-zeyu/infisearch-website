The crowd closed up around the vehicle in order to obtain a nearer view of their new masters and mistresses. They had known and loved as a patriarch the colonel, for he had always been kind and indulgent to them. Unfortunately they also knew Titus Lyon, by reputation if not personally, and for a month they had been wondering whether the new proprietor was like the colonel or his Kentucky brother.  The \"people\" were of all ages, from the bald-headed old negro with a flaxen fringe around his rear head on a level with his ears, down to the infant in arms, whose toothless grin contrasted with the ivory display of its mother. They were of all the hues of the colored race, from the ebony face whereon charcoal could make no mark to the light saffron tint of the octoroon.  There was a plentiful sprinkling of \"mammies\" and \"uncles\" among them, for all the older ones are called by these names. But the great body of them were young or middle-aged men and women, able-bodied and fit for regular work. Noah Lyon and his wife were particularly struck with the appearance of two girls sixteen to eighteen years old, who were nearly as white as their own children. They were neatly and modestly dressed, and both of them had very pretty faces. They were employed in the house as waiters at the table, and in other general work.  \"Glad to see you, mars'r!\" shouted a score of the tribe in unison. \"Glad to see you, missus!\" \"Gib you welcome to Barcreek, mars'r and missus!\" \"Glad to see de young mars'rs and missusses!\"  Levi, with a very broad and cheerful smile upon his round face, descended from the wagon with the reins in his hand, which he handed to a mulatto whom he called Frank, who had been the colonel's coachman. He proceeded to assist Mrs. Lyon to alight, and her husband followed her without any of the assistance tendered to him, for he was only forty years old, and almost as nimble as he had ever been. The manager handed the girls to the ground as politely as though he had served his time as a dancing-master, and the young ladies smiled upon him as sweetly as though he had been a younger beau.  \"This is Diana, Mrs. Lyon, the cook and housekeeper,\" said Levi, taking a yellow woman of fifty by the arm, and presenting her to the new lady of the house.  \"Diana, missus, and not Dinah,\" added the housekeeper, as the lady took her hand.  \"I will always call you Diana, and never Dinah,\" replied Mrs. Lyon. \"I have no doubt we shall be good friends, though I am not used to your ways in Kentucky.\"  \"This girl is Sylvie,\" said Diana, drawing the elder of the two octoroons into the presence of the lady; and her color was light enough to make her blushes transparent. \"This is Julie,\" she added, bringing the other of the pretty pair to the front. \"Both of them wait on the table, and 'tend on missus. Both of them come from New Orleans when they were little girls, and both of them speak French like a pair of mocking-birds.\"  \"I am very happy to see you, girls, and I think we shall get along very well together, for I have never been used to having any one to wait on me,\" said the lady, as she took each of them by the hand; and they were so pretty that she was disposed to kiss them.  The rest of the family were presented in like manner to the house servants, and Levi introduced them to the rest of the people in a mass. The Lyons all felt that they had suddenly become lions, at least so far as Riverlawn was concerned. Noah had been a prosperous farmer in New Hampshire, engaged in some outside operation in which he had been successful; but even in haying-time he had never had more than three hired men. This avalanche of half a hundred servants suddenly attached to him was a new and novel experience; and the situation was just as strange to his wife and the young people.  Aunty Diana conducted the family into the house with many bows and flourishes, followed by the pretty octoroons, and ushered them into the drawing-room, which had seldom been used when the colonel was alive; for he was as simple in his manners as Noah, though he felt obliged to keep up the style of the mansion.  \"Help you take your things off, missus?\" said Diana to Mrs. Lyon, while Sylvie and Julie tendered their services to Dorcas and Hope.  \"We should like to go to our rooms, Diana,\" replied the lady. \"I suppose they are all ready for us.\"  \"All ready, missus.\"  \"Of course you can take your choice of the rooms, Mrs. Lyon,\" interposed Levi, who had come into the house as soon as he had sent the people to their cottages. \"There are eight rooms on the second floor, besides two company chambers; and I suppose Diana has already picked out one for the owner and his wife.\"  \"You can take just what room you like, missus, but I picked out the colonel's chamber for mars'r and missus, 'cause it is the biggest, has a dressing-room and four great closets. I think that one suit missus best,\" added Diana.  \"We will all go up-stairs and look at the rooms,\" replied Mrs. Lyon.  She concluded to take the colonel's room, to which Noah assented; and it was a palatial apartment to both of them. The girls were next provided with rooms, and the two octoroons were unremitting in their attentions to them. Though they knew that these girls were slaves, they treated them like sisters, and before the day was over they were fast friends; for both of them were utterly devoid of any Southern prejudices against those who were so nearly of their own color. They were disposed to treat all the servants kindly, but they had not the same feeling towards those of ebony hue.  The same sentiment prevailed through the family; and as a rule it pervaded most of the enlightened families of the South. The girls as well as the mother--and Dorcas and Artie looked upon and called Mrs. Lyon by this endearing name--had been accustomed to wait upon themselves, and they found it rather difficult to economize the willing hands of Sylvie and Julie. But when Pink arrived with the trunks and other baggage, the field-hands \"toted\" them to the proper chambers, and the aid of the servants was very welcome, for both of them were tired after the long journey they had made.  As the great clock in the spacious hall below struck six, the family were summoned to supper. Levi acted as master of ceremonies, for Diana was busy in the kitchen, with her two assistants; but he seemed to have some doubts about seating himself at his employer's table, though he had always had a place there in the colonel's time.  \"Sit here, if you please, Levi, and always consider yourself as one of the family,\" said Noah, after he had asked Deck to take the second seat on the right, giving the manager the first, which is the seat of honor; and the question of Levi's position at Riverlawn was settled once for all.  \"Thank you, Major Lyon,\" replied he, as he took the place assigned to him. \"I always sat at the table with Colonel Lyon, even when he had guests; but it isn't always the rule with planters to have the overseer at his table, and I am much obliged to you for your consideration.\"  \"When I had two or three hired men on my farm, they always came to the table with me, and would have thought they were abused if they had been placed at a separate board,\" laughed the embryo planter. \"But they were the 'mud-sills' of the North, you know.\"  \"I was raised in Tennessee, Major, and was tolerably well educated. I was in business for myself in Shelbyville, the capital of our county, which was named for one of my ancestors. But I did not succeed, for the place was not big enough. I bought some nice horses of Colonel Lyon, and for some reason he took a fancy to me.\"  \"I don't think that was very strange,\" added Noah.  \"When I failed, he wanted me to come and manage this place for him; and I have been here ever since. He paid me well, and I have always done the best I could for him. He was a good man; and it looks to me just as though his successor was as good a man as he was.\"  \"Thank you, Levi; I believe we shall be friends.\"  \"Betwixt you and me, Major,\" continued the manager in a low tone, \"when the colonel's health began to be rather shaky, though I had no idea he was so near his end, I had a mortal dread that a certain other man would come into possession of this place. Excuse me for saying that, but I couldn't help it. Since I met you this noon, Major, I have been lifted up to the seventh heaven.\"  Noah did not deem it wise to make any reply to this remark then; but he intended to inquire more particularly in regard to his Kentucky brother when he had an opportunity; and it appeared that the manager had some very pronounced opinions in regard to Titus. He changed the subject, and continued to eat his supper.  The meal was elaborate enough for a family feast. After the fried ham and bacon, the fried chicken, with baked potatoes and the nicest white cornbread the family had ever eaten, came hot biscuits, waffles, and griddle-cakes, and cake of several kinds, which were fully approved by Mrs. Lyon. Diana came in before the party rose from the table, and the praises bestowed upon her handiwork in the kitchen would have made her blush if she had been as light-colored as the two girls that waited upon the table.  When Noah Lyon went to his room after supper, and was alone there, he took from his pocket the letter from his deceased brother which Colonel Cosgrove had given him. It was with no little emotion that he broke the cumbrous seals. It looked very much like a mystery to him, for the estate had been duly divided in the will.  It was a very kindly and brotherly letter for the first page. Then the colonel stated that Noah had by the time he received the letter discovered that the value of the fifty-one negroes on the estate had not been included in his valuation of the property. They were worth at least twenty-five thousand dollars. They had been given to him with the plantation, but he enjoined it upon him on no account to sell one of them.  In the letter he found"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35206"],["title","Brother Against Brother; Or, The War on the Border (#6)"],["body","as carefully sealed as the one that enclosed it, directed to his successor, with the direction: \"Not to be opened till five years from the date of my death. Duncan Lyon.\"  The letter evidently related to the slaves on the plantation; but the mystery in regard to them was still unsolved.     CHAPTER V  THE DISTRESS OF MRS. TITUS LYON   In the rear of the drawing-room was the library. It contained about five hundred bound volumes, and more than this number of pamphlets and documents, which had accumulated in a quarter of a century. It contained a large desk and a safe, and the apartment was an office rather than a library, though the owner of Riverlawn had largely improved his education by reading in his abundant leisure. The shelves were piled high with newspapers and magazines, which appeared to have been the staple of his intellectual food.  Levi had given the key of the safe to the new proprietor; and after Noah had read and reread the open letter, and pondered its contents, he carried the one which was not to be opened for five years to the library, and deposited it in the safe with the explanatory epistle which left the whole subject a mystery. What was eventually to become of the negroes was not indicated, but he was enjoined not to sell one of them on any account.  Though opposed to the extension of slavery, Noah Lyon did not believe that Congress had any constitutional right to meddle with the system as it existed in the States. He had never been brought into contact with slavery, and did not howl when his brother became a slaveholder. Like the majority of the people of the North, he was instinctively, as it were, opposed to human bondage; but he had never been considered a fanatic or an abolitionist by his friends and neighbors. He simply refrained from meddling with the subject.  The fifty-one negroes on the estate had been willed to him, and he was as much a slaveholder as his brother had been. The injunction not to sell one of them was needless in its application to him, for he would as readily have thought of selling one of his own children as any human being.  It would require a bulky volume to detail the experience of Noah Lyon and his family during the years that followed his arrival at Barcreek. He was an intelligent man, richly endowed with saving common-sense, and soon made himself familiar with all the affairs of the plantation. He made the acquaintance of the servants, which was no small matter in itself, for he ascertained the history, disposition, and character of all of them.  He found that his brother had not over-estimated the worth of Levi Bedford, who soon became a great favorite with all the family. The new proprietor found no occasion to change the conduct of affairs in the management of the place, even if he had felt that he was competent to improve the methods and system of his late brother. Everything went on as before. Levi made the crops of hemp, tobacco, corn, and vegetables, and raised horses, marketing everything to be sold. He consulted his employer, but he had little to say.  The family became acquainted with their neighbors within a circuit of ten miles, and in spite of their origin they were kindly and hospitably received by the best families.  At the end of a year the Lyons had practically become Kentuckians. In the following year came the great political campaign which resulted in the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency. Ominous growls had been heard from the South, and even in the border State of Kentucky. Noah regarded the situation with no little anxiety; but he continued to attend to his own affairs, and it was not till the bombardment of Fort Sumter that he began to take an active part in the agitation which was shaking the entire nation.  Titus Lyon was one of the most stormy and aggressive of the Southern sympathizers. Even neutrality was a compromise with him. When Noah's family took possession of Riverlawn, he did not call at the mansion for several days, though his wife and Mabel, his eldest daughter, had spent the day after their arrival with them. Though Titus said nothing at first, or for months to come, it was very evident to Noah that he was intensely dissatisfied with the distribution the colonel had made of his property.  The state of affairs in Barcreek has been shown in the conversation between the planter and his son on the bridge. This seemed to be a favorite resort for conferences, and they returned to it after dinner. On one side of it was a seat which had been put up there years before; for it was shaded by a magnificent tree which grew by the side of the creek road, and the bridge was the coolest place on the estate in a hot day.  \"Of course you heard what your mother said about her visit to Titus's house to-day, Dexter,\" said the father, as he seated himself on the bench.  \"I could not well help hearing it,\" replied Deck.  \"If there is anything in this world I abominate, it is a family quarrel,\" continued Noah, fixing his gaze upon the dark waters of the creek. \"Your uncle seems to be disposed to be at variance with me, though I am sure I have done nothing of which he can reasonably complain. He is down upon every Union man in the county. I should say that Barcreek was about equally divided between the two parties. But he does not talk politics to me, as he does to every other man in the place.\"  \"I don't know what he means when he says you owe him five thousand dollars, for I thought the boot was on the other leg,\" said Deck, looking into the troubled face of his father.  \"He owes me several hundred dollars I lent him before he sold his railroad stock. He is able to pay me now, for he has turned his securities into money, and he seems to be flinging it away as fast as he can. He must be worth twenty-five thousand dollars, including his house and land; but I don't know how much of it he has thrown away.\"  \"If he has spent five thousand dollars for arms, ammunition, and uniforms, he must have made a big hole in it,\" suggested Deck. \"He keeps three horses when he has no use for more than one.\"  \"He never had a tenth part as much money before in his life, and he does not know how to use it. He will be the captain of a Home Guard as soon as he can enlist the men, and the people on his side of the question at the village have begun to call him 'Captain Lyon,' or 'Captain Titus.'\"  \"Sandy told me that he, his father, and Orly had been drilling for three months with an old soldier who was in the Mexican War,\" added Deck. \"There comes Artie in one of the boats.\"  \"Where is he going?\" asked Noah.  \"I'm sure I don't know; Artie don't always tell where he is going,\" answered Deck.  His cousin, whom he regarded and treated as his brother, was pulling a very handsome keel boat leisurely up the creek. The colonel appeared to have had some aquatic tastes, for at a kind of pier half-way between the bridge and the river were a sailboat and two row-boats, all of which were kept in excellent condition. In places the river was wide enough to allow the use of a boat with a sail, and the colonel had had some skill in managing one; but neither Noah nor his boys could handle such a craft, and it was never used.  The creek extended back some ten miles through a flat, swampy region, and Deck and Artie had explored it almost to its source in some low hills not a dozen miles from the Mammoth Cave. Like most boys, they were fond of boats, and nothing but the forbidding command of the planter prevented them from experimenting with the Magnolia, as the sailboat was called by the colonel.  If the boys had explored Bar Creek to its source, they would have discovered that it came out of the numerous \"sinks\" to be found in this portion of the country, and streams flowed in subterranean channels which honeycombed the earth at a greater or less depth below the surface.  \"What are you up to, Deck?\" shouted Artie, as he approached the bridge.  \"Nothing particular,\" replied the one on the bridge. \"Where are you going?\"  \"Up the creek,\" answered Artie very indefinitely. \"Can't you go with me? It is easier for two to row this boat than for one.\"  \"I don't want to go now,\" returned Deck, who was too much interested in the conversation with his father to leave him.  \"You may go with him if you want to, Dexter,\" interposed Mr. Lyon.  \"I don't care about going now, father. Do you suppose Uncle Titus has really bought the arms and things as mother says?\" asked Deck.  \"Your aunt is very much worried about the actions of your uncle. I suppose he told her what he had done, for she would not make up such a story out of whole cloth. Besides, it seems to be in keeping with a dozen other things he has done; and he is certainly doing all he can to raise a company in Barcreek,\" replied Mr. Lyon.  \"Isn't it strange that he never says anything to you about politics, especially such as we are having now?\" asked the son.  \"I don't see him very often; he is at Bowling Green half the time. Besides, he and I never agreed on politics. By the great George Washington, there he is now!\" exclaimed Noah Lyon, springing up from his seat on the bench.  Titus Lyon was seated with his wife in a stylish buggy. He stopped his horse on the bridge when he came opposite to his brother, and passing the reins to Mrs. Lyon he descended to the planks. His wife drove on, and stopped at the front door of the mansion. Frank the coachman ran with all his might from the stable to take charge of the team, and the lady went into the house.  \"How do you do, Titus?\" said Noah, extending his hand to his brother.  \"I think it is about time for me to have some talk with you, Noah,\" replied Titus, ignoring the offered hand, and bestowing a frowning look upon Deck. \"Send that boy away.\"  \"Dexter knows all about my affairs, and I don't have many secrets from him,\" replied Noah very mildly, and somewhat nettled to have his son treated in that rude manner.  \"I came over here on purpose to talk with you; and what I have"]]]
