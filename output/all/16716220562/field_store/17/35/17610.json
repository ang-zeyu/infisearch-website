In youth, the period of greatest activity, the animal constituent is in excess: a bone then does not break so readily, but, when broken, unites with great rapidity and strength. On the other hand, the bones of old persons are more easily broken, and in some cases fail to unite. The mineral matter being then in excess, indicates that the period of active exertion is drawing to a close.  {17}  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--SECTION OF BONE.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2.  Structure of bone enlarged.]  [Sidenote: 5. In what respect admirably fashioned? Its formation? Microscopic examination? The inference? \"Line of beauty?\"]  5. THE STRUCTURE OF THE BONES.--If we examine one of the long bones, which has been sawn through lengthwise, we observe that it is admirably fashioned for affording lightness as well as strength (Fig. 1). Its exterior is hard and resisting, but it is porous at the broad extremities, while through the central portion there is a cavity or canal which contains an oily substance, called _marrow_. Let us now take a thin section of bone, and examine it under the microscope; we discover that it is pierced by numerous fine tubes (Fig. 2), about which layers of bone-substance are arranged. Accordingly, though a bone be as hard as stone externally, it is by no means as heavy as stone, by reason of its light interior texture. Another element of power is found in the curved outline of the bones. The curved line is said to be \"the line of beauty,\" as it certainly is the line of strength, and is uniformly employed in the bones whose position exposes them to accident.  {18}  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE SKELETON]  {19}  [Sidenote: 6. Number of bones? Skeleton? The skull? Chest? The trunk? The trunk and skull, how maintained? What of the arms? Legs?]  6. THE SKELETON.--The number of bones in the human body exceeds two hundred. When these are joined together in the proper places, they form what is termed the _Skeleton_ (Fig. 3). It embraces three important cavities. The first, surmounting the frame, is a box of bone, called the _skull;_ below this, is a bony case, or \"chest;\" and lower down is a bony basin, called the _pelvis_. The two latter compose the trunk. The trunk and skull are maintained in their proper relations by the \"spinal column.\" Branching from the trunk are two sets of limbs: the arms, which are attached to the chest by means of the \"collar-bone\" and \"shoulder-blade;\" and the legs, directly joined to the lower part of the trunk.  [Sidenote: 7. Design of the cavities? Give the examples.]  7. The cavities of which we have spoken, are designed for the lodgment and protection of the more delicate and perishable parts of the system. Thus, the skull, together with the bones of the face, shelters the brain and the organs of four senses--sight, hearing, smell, and taste. The chest contains the heart, lungs, and great blood-vessels, while the lower part of the trunk sustains the liver, stomach, and other organs.  [Sidenote: 8. Joint or articulation? Movable joints, how compacted? The ligaments of the movable joints? What is a sprain? Consequence of a serious sprain?]  8. THE JOINTS.--The point of union of two or more bones forms a joint or _articulation_, the connection being made in various ways according to the kind and amount of motion desired. The movable joints are compacted together by certain strong fibrous bands, called ligaments. These ligaments are of a shining, silvery whiteness, and very unyielding; so much so, that when sudden violence is brought to bear in the vicinity of a joint, the bone to which a ligament is attached may be broken, while the ligament itself remains uninjured. When this connecting material of the joints is strained or lacerated by an {20} accident, a \"sprain\" is the consequence. An injury of this sort may be, and frequently is, quite as serious as the breaking of a bone.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--CELLS OF CARTILAGE.]  [Sidenote: 9. Office of the ligament? What must it have? How accomplished? Describe it. Synovia?]  9. The ligament, then, secures firmness to the joint; it must also have flexibility and smoothness of motion. This is accomplished by a beautiful mechanism the perfection of which is only feebly imitated by the most ingenious contrivance of man. The ends of the bones are covered by a thin layer of _cartilage_, which being smooth and elastic, renders all the movements of the joint very easy. In addition to this, there is an arrangement introduced for \"lubricating\" the joint, by means of a delicate sac containing fluid. This fluid is constantly supplied in small quantities, but only so fast as it is used up in exercise. In appearance, it is not unlike the white of an egg, and hence its name _synovia_, or egg-like.  [Sidenote: 10. What do we observe as regards the composition of a joint? The ligament and cartilage? What varies? Example of the skull? Other examples? The ball-and-socket joint?]  10. Thus, we observe, that two very different substances enter into the composition of a joint. The ligament, very unyielding, affords strength, while the cartilage, elastic and moist, gives ease and smoothness of motion. The amount of motion provided for varies greatly in different joints. In some there is none at all, as in the skull, where one bone is dove-tailed into another by what are termed _sutures_. Others have a hinge-like motion, such as those of the elbow, wrist, ankle, and knee; the most complete of these being the elbow-joint (Fig. 5). Belonging to another class, the {21} ball-and-socket joint, is that at the shoulder, possessing a freedom of motion greater than any other in the body.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--ELBOW JOINT. A, Bone of the arm; B, C, Bones of the fore-arm.]  [Sidenote: 11. What is the spinal column? What does it connect and form? Joints of the vertebræ? Amount of motion? Result?]  11. THE SPINAL COLUMN.--The spinal column is often spoken of as the \"back-bone,\" as if it were a single bone, while, in reality, it is composed of a chain of twenty-six small bones, called _vertebræ_. The spinal column is a wonderful piece of mechanism. It not only connects the important cavities of the body, as has already been shown, but, also, itself forms a canal, which contains the spinal cord. The joints of the vertebræ are remarkable for the thick layers of cartilage which separate the adjacent surfaces of bone. The amount of motion between any two of these bones is not great; but these little movements, taken together, admit of very considerable flexibility, in several directions, without endangering the supporting power of the column.  {22}  [Sidenote: 12. Elasticity of the frame? Protection of the brain from shocks? Tallness of persons? Effects of reclining?]  [Illustration: FIG. 6--THE SPINAL COLUMN.]  12. The abundant supply of intervertebral cartilage has another important use, namely, it adds greatly to the elasticity of the frame. It is due, in part, to this elastic material, and in part to the frequent curves of the spine, that the brain and other delicate organs are protected from the shock of sudden falls or jars. During the day, the constant pressure upon these joints, while the body is erect, diminishes the thickness of the cartilages; so that a person is not so tall in the evening as in the morning. The effects of this compression pass away when the body reclines in a horizontal position.  [Sidenote: 13. Change in bone? Example--animal and madder. Rapidity of change in color? Waste and repair?]  13. THE GROWTH OF BONE.--Bone, like all the other tissues of the body, is constantly undergoing change, old material being withdrawn, and new particles taking their place. This has been shown conclusively by experiments. If an animal be fed with madder--a red coloring matter--for a day or two, the bones soon become tinged; then, if the madder be discontinued for a few days, the original color returns. If, however, this material be alternately given and withheld, at short intervals, the bone will be marked by a succession of red and white rings. In very young animals, all the bones become colored in a single day; in older ones, a longer time is required. The process of waste and repair, therefore, is constantly taking place in this hard substance, and with astonishing rapidity. {23}  14. THE REPAIR OF BONE.--Nature's provision for uniting broken bones is very complete. At first, blood is poured out around the ends of the bone, as a result of the injury. This is gradually absorbed, and gives place to a watery fluid, which, thickening from day to day, acquires, at the end of two weeks, the consistency of jelly. This begins to harden, by a deposit of new bone-substance, until, at the expiration of five or six weeks, the broken bone may be said to be united. It is, however, still fragile, and must be used carefully a few weeks longer. The process of hardening continues, and months must pass before the union can be said to be complete.

THE MUSCLES.  _The Muscles--Flexion and Extension--The Tendons--Contraction--Physical Strength--Necessity for Exercise--Its Effects--Forms of Exercise--Walking--Riding--Gymnastics--Open-air Exercise--Sleep--Recreation._  [Sidenote: 1. What are the muscles? Their number? The design of most of them? Of a few?]  1. THE MUSCLES.-- The great mass of the body external to the skeleton, is composed of the flesh, or _Muscles_, which largely determines its outline and weight. The muscles are the organs of motion. Their number is about four hundred, and to each of them is assigned a separate and distinct office. They have all been studied, one by one, and a name given to each, by the anatomist. Each is attached to bones which it is designed to move. A few are circular in form, and enclose cavities, the size of which they diminish by contraction.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--MUSCULAR TISSUE.  _a_, _b_, Striped muscular fibres: _c_, The same more highly magnified.]  [Sidenote: 2. The structure of flesh? Its color, etc.? The composition of the fibres? How marked?]  2. If we examine a piece of flesh, we observe that it is soft, and of a deep red color. Its structure appears to be composed of layers and bundles of small fibres. Let us further examine these fibres under the microscope. We now discover that they are, in turn, made up of still finer fibres, of _fibrillæ_: these are seen in Fig. 8. The fibres are beautifully {26} marked by parallel wavy lines, about ten thousand to an inch, which give the fibre its name of the _striped_ muscular fibre. All of the voluntary muscles present this appearance.  [Sidenote: 3. Arrangement of the muscles? Their action? Flexion and extension? Action of the muscles when we stand erect?]  3. FLEXION AND EXTENSION.--The muscles are, for the most part, so arranged in pairs, or corresponding sets, that when motion is produced in one direction by one set, there is, opposite to it, another muscle, or group of muscles, which brings the limb back to its place. When they act alternately, a to-and-fro movement results. When a joint is bent, the motion is called _flexion_; and when it is made straight again, it is called _extension_. When both sets act equally, and at the same moment, no motion is produced, but the body or limb is maintained in a fixed position: this occurs when we stand erect. The muscles which produce extension are more powerful than those opposite to them.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--A, Biceps muscle of the arm: B, C, Its tendons.]  [Sidenote: 4. Kinds of muscles? The voluntary? Involuntary? The heart? Give the example. The hand? Arm?]  4. The muscles are also distinguished, on the other hand, as the voluntary and involuntary muscles, according as they are, or are not, under the control of the will. The heart is an example of the involuntary variety. We cannot change its action in the least by an effort of the will. When we sleep, and the will ceases to act, the heart continues to beat without cessation. The voluntary muscles, on the other hand, are such as are used only when we wish or _will_ to use them--as the muscles of the hand or arm (Fig. 9).  {27}  [Sidenote: 5. What are the tendons or sinews? Their strength? Color? Location? Tendon of Achilles? The fable? Muscles of the leg?]  5. THE TENDONS.--Tendons, or sinews, are the extremities of muscles, and are compactly fastened upon bone. They are very strong, and of a silvery whiteness. They may be felt just beneath the skin, in certain parts of the body, when the muscles are being used, as at the bend of the elbow or knee. The largest tendon of the body is that which is inserted into the heel, called the tendon of Achilles, after the hero of the Grecian poet, the fable relating that it was at this point that he received his death-wound, no other part of his body being vulnerable. The muscles which extend into the leg unite to form a single and very powerful tendon, and enclose a small bone called the knee-pan, which, acting like a pulley, greatly increases their power, and at the same time protects the front of the knee-joint (Fig. 10).  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--VIEW OF KNEE-JOINT. A, Thigh bone: B, Knee-pan: C, D, Leg bones.]  [Sidenote: 6. Contraction of the muscles? Bending of the arm or finger? Other agencies? Automatic movements? In cold-blooded animals?]  6. MUSCULAR CONTRACTION.--The muscles, when acted upon by the appropriate stimulus, contract, or so change {28} their shape, that their extremities are brought nearer together. The bending of the arm, or of a finger, is effected in this manner, by the will; but the will is not the only means of producing this effect. Electricity, a sharp blow over a muscle, and other stimuli, also cause it. Contraction does not always cease with life. In man, after death from cholera, automatic movements of hands and feet have been observed, lasting not less than an hour. In certain cold-blooded animals, as the turtle, contraction has been known to take place for several days after the head has been cut off.  [Sidenote: 7. Contractility? Give the illustration. What was supposed? What is the case?]  7. The property which, in muscle, enables these movements to take place is called _contractility_. If we grasp a muscle while in exercise (for example, the large muscle in the front of the arm), we notice the alternate swelling and decrease of the muscle, as we move the forearm to and fro. It was at one time supposed that the muscle actually increased in volume during contraction. This, however, is not the case; for the muscle, while gaining in thickness, loses in length in the same proportion; and thus, the volume remains the same in action and at rest.  [Sidenote: 8. What further in relation to contraction? Weariness of a muscle? Beating of the heart? Standing and walking?]  8. Contraction is not the permanent, or normal, state of a muscle. It cannot long remain contracted, but after a shorter or longer time, it wearies and is obliged to relax. After a short rest, it can then again contract. It is for this reason that the heart can beat all through life, night and day, by having, as we shall hereafter see, a brief interval of rest between successive pulsations. For the same reason, it is more fatiguing to stand for any great length of time in one position, than to be walking the same period.  [Sidenote: 9. Muscular power of animals? How tested? Man's power? Horse's? The comparison?]  9. RELATIVE STRENGTH OF ANIMALS.--The amount of muscular power which different animals can exert, has {29} been tested by experiment. By determining the number of pounds which an animal can drag upon a level surface, and afterward comparing that with its own weight, we can judge of its muscular force. It is found that man is able to drag a little less than his own weight. A draught-horse can exert a force equal to about two-thirds of his weight. The horse, therefore, though vastly heavier than man, is relatively not so powerful.  [Sidenote: 10. Power of insects? Beetles? Give the conclusion.]  10. Insects are remarkable for their power of carrying objects larger and heavier than themselves. Many of them can drag ten, and even twenty times their weight. Some of the beetles have been known to move bodies more than forty times their own weight. So far, therefore, from it being a fact that animals have strength in proportion to their weight and bulk, the reverse of that statement seems to be the law.  [Sidenote: 11. Difference in strength of individuals? How caused?]  11. PHYSICAL STRENGTH.--The difference in strength, as seen in different individuals, is not due to any original difference in their muscles. Nature gives essentially the same kind and amount of muscles to each person, and the power of one, or the weakness of another, arises, in great part, from the manner in which these organs are used or disused.  [Sidenote: 12. Complaint in relation to degeneracy? How true? How determined by armor? The fair supposition?]  12. Many authors complain of the physical degeneracy of men at the present day, as compared with past generations. There is room for doubt as to the correctness of this statement. Certain experiments have recently been made with the metallic armor worn seven hundred years ago, by which it is found that any man, of ordinary height and muscular development, can carry the armor and wield the weapons of an age supposed to be greatly our superior in strength. When we consider that in those days, only very strong men could endure the hardships of soldier-life, {30} it is fair to suppose that our age has not so greatly degenerated in respect to physical strength.  [Sidenote: 13 Action? Use of organs? Training of the mind? The child's brain? Education of the body?]  13. IMPORTANCE OF EXERCISE.--Action is the law of the living body. Every organ demands use to preserve it in full vigor, and to obtain from it its best services. The value of that training of the mind, which we call education, is everywhere recognized. The child is early put to school, and for many years continues to study, in order that his brain, which is the great centre of mental power, may act healthfully and with force. It is important that the body, also, should receive its education by exercise. This is especially true of persons belonging to certain classes of society, whose occupation confines them within doors, and requires chiefly brain-work.  [Sidenote:"]]]
