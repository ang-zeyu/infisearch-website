[Illustration: No. 10                          VERDI AS A YOUNG MAN]  So, as the years went by, he kept on learning more and more, doing his work well and always preparing himself for better things. Then one day he was ready to begin to compose the operas that made him famous.  Some time when you read the full list of Verdi's operas you will learn that he wrote thirty. The first was performed in 1839, when he was twenty-six years old, and the last in 1893, when he was eighty. You will not need to remember the titles of them all, but you must know the names of the great ones, for one day you will see and hear them performed.                           [Illustration: No. 11                          VERDI IN OLD AGE]  Here are the principal ones:      Ernani,             La Traviata,            Aida,     Rigoletto,          Sicilian Vespers,       Othello,     Il Trovatore,       Masked Ball,            Falstaff.  Do you know that of one of Verdi's operas the scene is laid in our country? The MASKED BALL was first entitled Gustavo III. But the authorities would not allow reference to certain political matters in it. Therefore the libretto (or story) of the opera was changed, and the scene laid in Boston, Massachusetts. One of the characters was the Governor of Boston, a humorous matter to us, for there never was any such official.  Another famous opera by Verdi, the scene of which is laid in a foreign country, is Aida. It was written for the Khedive of Egypt, and first performed in Cairo in 1871, when the composer was fifty-eight years old.                           [Illustration: No. 12                          A SCENE FROM AÏDA]  After Verdi had composed Aida he wrote no more operas for sixteen years. Then to the great surprise of all the world he wrote two others, the finest of them all--Othello and Falstaff.  Meanwhile he was a farmer. He planted, harvested, helped his tenants, urged them to cultivate the land carefully. He bought all kinds of American farming machinery to show the Italians how to cultivate the ground to best advantage.  The great man, who was once a simple little boy, died in 1901, on January 27, which day is the anniversary of Mozart's birth.  All his life long Verdi had succeeded, doing a little more and a little better each year, so that, at the end of his life, he was able to do a truly wonderful thing: namely, to build a home where musicians--who had not succeeded in life--could find a comfortable abiding place in their old age.

Here, too, is the tomb of Giuseppe Verdi.  Verdi was loved by his fellow-countrymen. His music is their joy--and ours--and will so remain for years to come; perhaps forever.  The great sculptor, Vincenzo Gemito, has molded wonderful bronze busts of Verdi, which shows us how the little boy of Roncole grew to be a man of world renown.                         *       *       *       *       *                          SOME FACTS ABOUT GIUSEPPE VERDI  Read these facts about Giuseppe Verdi, and try to write his story out of them, using your own words.

CARMEN   We was playin' rummy over to Hatch's, and Hatch must of fell in a bed of four-leaf clovers on his way home the night before, because he plays rummy like he does everything else; but this night I refer to you couldn't beat him, and besides him havin' all the luck my Missus played like she'd been bought off, so when we come to settle up we was plain seven and a half out. You know who paid it. So Hatch says:  \"They must be some game you can play.\"  \"No,\" I says, \"not and beat you. I can run two blocks w'ile you're stoopin' over to start, but if we was runnin' a foot race between each other, and suppose I was leadin' by eighty yards, a flivver'd prob'ly come up and hit you in the back and bump you over the finishin' line ahead o' me.\"  So Mrs. Hatch thinks I'm sore on account o' the seven-fifty, so she says:  \"It don't seem fair for us to have all the luck.\"  \"Sure it's fair!\" I says. \"If you didn't have the luck, what would you have?\"  \"I know,\" she says; \"but I don't never feel right winnin' money at cards.\"  \"I don't blame you,\" I says.  \"I know,\" she says; \"but it seems like we should ought to give it back or else stand treat, either one.\"  \"Jim's too old to change all his habits,\" I says.  \"Oh, well,\" says Mrs. Hatch, \"I guess if I told him to loosen up he'd loosen up. I ain't lived with him all these years for nothin'.\"  \"You'd be a sucker if you did,\" I says.  So they all laughed, and when they'd quieted down Mrs. Hatch says:  \"I don't suppose you'd feel like takin' the money back?\"  \"Not without a gun,\" I says. \"Jim's pretty husky.\"  So that give them another good laugh; but finally she says:  \"What do you say, Jim, to us takin' the money they lose to us and gettin' four tickets to some show?\"  Jim managed to stay conscious, but he couldn't answer nothin'; so my Missus says:  \"That'd be grand of you to do it, but don't think you got to.\"  Well, of course, Mrs. Hatch knowed all the w'ile she didn't have to, but from what my Missus says she could tell that if they really give us the invitation we wouldn't start no fight. So they talked it over between themself w'ile I and Hatch went out in the kitchen and split a pint o' beer, and Hatch done the pourin' and his best friend couldn't say he give himself the worst of it. So when we come back my Missus and Mrs. Hatch had it all framed that the Hatches was goin' to take us to a show, and the next thing was what show would it be. So Hatch found the afternoon paper, that somebody'd left on the street-car, and read us off a list o' the shows that was in town. I spoke for the Columbia, but the Missus give me the sign to stay out; so they argued back and forth and finally Mrs. Hatch says:  \"Let's see that paper a minute.\"  \"What for?\" says Hatch. \"I didn't hold nothin' out on you.\"  But he give her the paper and she run through the list herself, and then she says:  \"You did, too, hold out on us. You didn't say nothin' about the Auditorium.\"  \"What could I say about it?\" says Hatch. \"I never was inside.\"  \"It's time you was then,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"What's playin' there?\" I says.  \"Grand op'ra,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"Oh!\" says my Missus. \"Wouldn't that be wonderful?\"  \"What do you say?\" says Mrs. Hatch to me.  \"I think it'd be grand for you girls,\" I says. \"I and Jim could leave you there and go down on Madison and see Charley Chaplin, and then come back after you.\"  \"Nothin' doin'!\" says Mrs. Hatch. \"We'll pick a show that everybody wants to see.\"  Well, if I hadn't of looked at my Missus then we'd of been O. K. But my eyes happened to light on where she was settin' and she was chewin' her lips so's she wouldn't cry. That finished me. \"I was just kiddin',\" I says to Mrs. Hatch. \"They ain't nothin' I'd like better than grand op'ra.\"  \"Nothin' except gettin' trimmed in a rummy game,\" says Hatch, but he didn't get no rise.  Well, the Missus let loose of her lips so's she could smile and her and Mrs. Hatch got all excited, and I and Hatch pretended like we was excited too. So Hatch ast what night could we go, and Mrs. Hatch says that depended on what did we want to hear, because they changed the bill every day. So her and the Missus looked at the paper again and found out where Friday night was goin' to be a big special night and the bill was a musical show called _Carmen_, and all the stars was goin' to sing, includin' Mooratory and Alda and Genevieve Farr'r, that was in the movies a w'ile till they found out she could sing, and some fella they called Daddy, but I don't know his real name. So the girls both says Friday night was the best, but Hatch says he would have to go to lodge that evenin'.  \"Lodge!\" says Mrs. Hatch. \"What do you care about lodge when you got a chance to see Genevieve Farr'r in _Carmen_?\"  \"Chance!\" says Hatch. \"If that's what you call a chance, I got a chance to buy a thousand shares o' Bethlehem Steel. Who's goin' to pay for my chance?\"  \"All right,\" says Mrs. Hatch, \"go to your old lodge and spoil everything!\"  So this time it was her that choked up and made like she was goin' to blubber. So Hatch changed his mind all of a sudden and decided to disappoint the brother Owls. So all of us was satisfied except fifty per cent., and I and the Missus beat it home, and on the way she says how nice Mrs. Hatch was to give us this treat.  \"Yes,\" I says, \"but if you hadn't of had a regular epidemic o' discardin' deuces and treys Hatch would of treated us to groceries for a week.\" I says: \"I always thought they was only twelve pitcher cards in the deck till I seen them hands you saved up to-night.\"  \"You lose as much as I did,\" she says.  \"Yes,\" I says, \"and I always will as long as you forget to fetch your purse along.\"  So they wasn't no come-back to that, so we went on home without no more dialogue.  Well, Mrs. Hatch called up the next night and says Jim had the tickets boughten and we was to be sure and be ready at seven o'clock Friday night because the show started at eight. So when I was down-town Friday the Missus sent my evenin' dress suit over to Katzes' and had it pressed up and when I come home it was laid out on the bed like a corpse.  \"What's that for?\" I says.  \"For the op'ra,\" she says. \"Everybody wears them to the op'ra.\"  \"Did you ask the Hatches what was they goin' to wear?\" I says.  \"No,\" says she. \"They know what to wear without me tellin' them. They ain't goin' to the Auditorium in their nightgown.\"  So I clumb into the soup and fish, and the Missus spent about a hour puttin' on a dress that she could have left off without nobody knowin' the difference, and she didn't have time for no supper at all, and I just managed to surround a piece o' steak as big as your eye and spill some gravy on my clo'es when the bell rung and there was the Hatches.  Well, Hatch didn't have no more evenin' dress suit on than a kewpie. I could see his pants under his overcoat and they was the same old bay pants he'd wore the day he got mad at his kid and christened him Kenneth. And his shoes was a last year's edition o' the kind that's supposed to give your feet a chance, and if his feet had of been the kind that takes chances they was two or three places where they could of got away without much trouble.  I could tell from the expression on Mrs. Hatch's face when she seen our make-up that we'd crossed her. She looked about as comf'table as a Belgium.  \"Oh!\" she says. \"I didn't think you'd dress up.\"  \"We thought you would,\" says my Frau.  \"We!\" I says. \"Where do you get that 'we'?\"  \"If it ain't too late we'll run in and change,\" says my Missus.  \"Not me,\" I says. \"I didn't go to all this trouble and expense for a splash o' gravy. When this here uniform retires it'll be to make room for pyjamas.\"  \"Come on!\" says Hatch. \"What's the difference? You can pretend like you ain't with us.\"  \"It don't really make no difference,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  And maybe it didn't. But we all stood within whisperin' distance of each other on the car goin' in, and if you had a dollar for every word that was talked among us you couldn't mail a postcard from Hammond to Gary. When we got off at Congress my Missus tried to thaw out the party.  \"The prices is awful high, aren't they?\" she says.  \"Outrageous,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  Well, even if the prices was awful high, they didn't have nothin' on our seats. If I was in trainin' to be a steeple jack I'd go to grand op'ra every night and leave Hatch buy my ticket. And where he took us I'd of been more at home in overalls and a sport shirt.  \"How do you like Denver?\" says I to the Missus, but she'd sank for the third time.  \"We're safe here,\" I says to Hatch. \"Them French guns can't never reach us. We'd ought to brought more bumbs.\"  \"What did the seats cost?\" I says to Hatch.  \"One-fifty,\" he says.  \"Very reasonable,\" says I. \"One o' them aviators wouldn't take you more than half this height for a five-spot.\"  The Hatches had their overcoats off by this time and I got a look at their full costume. Hatch had went without his vest durin' the hot months and when it was alongside his coat and pants it looked like two different families. He had a pink shirt with prune-colored horizontal bars, and a tie to match his neck, and a collar that would of took care of him and I both, and them shoes I told you about, and burlap hosiery. They wasn't nothin' the matter with Mrs. Hatch except she must of thought that, instead o' dressin' for"]]]
