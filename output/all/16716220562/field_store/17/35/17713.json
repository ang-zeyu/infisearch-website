[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34546"],["title","Additions to the List of the Birds of Louisiana (#2)"],["body"," Dove  The Louisiana State University Museum of Zo√∂logy now has a series of 21 specimens of _Columbigallina passerina_ collected in Louisiana since the publication of Oberholser's book, in which only a few records for _C. p. passerina_ alone are cited. Examination of the new material reveals that eleven specimens are clearly referable to _pallescens_, providing, therefore, an addition to the avifauna of the state. As might be expected, _pallescens_ prevails in the western part of the state, although, at least occasionally, it migrates farther east. The specimens identifiable as _pallescens_ are as follows: 7 [Male], 1 [Female], Cameron, April 3, 1938 (Lowery); December 15, 1940 (Wallace); November 1 and 20, 1941 (Burdick and Lowery); October 31, 1942 (Burdick and Tucker). Two females were taken at White Castle on January 18, 1938 (Hewes), and another was shot at Carville on January 15, 1941 (Lowery). No Louisiana breeding record for the species is yet available, but in 1939 I saw a pair in the last week of May at Baton Rouge, another near Plaquemine on May 17, 1946, and George M. Sutton and I noted a pair almost daily at Cameron between April 22 and 30, 1942. If the bird breeds in Cameron Parish, the nesting race may prove to be _pallescens_, since a bird taken there on April 3, as listed above, belongs to that subspecies.   #Chordeiles minor minor# (Forster), Eastern Nighthawk  Since the one previous record (Oberholser, _op. cit._, 348) of the occurrence of this subspecies in the state now proves to be an example of _C. m. howelli_, the following specimens, all taken after the publication of Oberholser's book, constitute the only Louisiana records: 4 [Male], 1 [Female], University, October 3, 5, 12, 23, 1941 (Burdick, Howell, Ray, and Lowery); 4 [Male], 1 [Female], University, May 15, 18, 22, 30, 1942 (Burdick and Lowery); 1 [Male], Creole, September 2, 1944 (Burdick).   #Chordeiles minor howelli# Oberholser, Howell Nighthawk  The only state records known, all previously unpublished, are as follows: 1 [Female], Colfax, May 15, 1937 (Lowery); 2 [Male], 1 [Female], University, May 23 and 24 and October 3, 1941 (Ray and Lowery); 3 [Male], University, May 22 and 25, 1942 (Burdick); 1 [Male], Chloe, 10 miles south, April 28, 1945; 1 [Male], Creole, 2 miles west, April 30, 1945 (Tucker).   #Chordeiles minor aserriensis# Cherrie, Cherrie Nighthawk  Three specimens, one male and two females, taken from flocks of migrating nighthawks at University on September 29 and October 3 and 9, 1941 (Ray and Lowery), are the only records of the occurrence of this race in the state.   #Chordeiles minor sennetti# Coues, Sennett Nighthawk  A female taken at University on September 29, 1941 (Burdick), and a male shot at the same place on May 22, 1942 (Lowery), constitute the basis for the addition of this subspecies to the Louisiana list.   #Chordeiles acutipennis texensis# Lawrence, Texas Nighthawk  At dusk on April 10, 1942, in company with Burdick and Ray, I encountered a small flock of nighthawks feeding over the marsh near the beach a few miles from Cameron. Darkness came before more than two could be collected, but both of these proved to be the Texas Nighthawk, a species not heretofore recorded from Louisiana. On the following day a nighthawk was found perched in a tree near the marsh where the birds had been seen the previous evening. It was collected and likewise proved to be _texensis_.   #Muscivora forficata# (Gmelin), Scissor-tailed Flycatcher  The nesting of this species in northwestern Louisiana has been indicated for some time, especially after Wallace noted it at Lucas, in Caddo Parish, on June 16 and July 21, 1942. However, the first authentic breeding record for the state was furnished by a freshly built nest found by Edgar W. Fullilove and myself several miles below Bossier, on July 3, 1945. At least two pairs were found there in a large cotton field in which an occasional pecan tree had been left standing. The nest was in one of these trees, about 25 feet from the ground and far out on the end of a limb. Fullilove informed me that to his knowledge the species had nested in this field for at least ten years and that on numerous previous occasions he had seen both nests and young.   #Myiarchus cinerascens cinerascens# (Lawrence), Ash-throated Flycatcher  The first record of the occurrence of this species in Louisiana is that of a male collected by Howell at University, on March 20, 1943. On December 23, 1945, I shot a second specimen, a female, on the bank of False River opposite New Roads. When found, both birds were actively pursuing insects and on being skinned, both were found to be very fat.   #Empidonax flaviventris# (Baird and Baird), Yellow-bellied Flycatcher  Oberholser (_op. cit._, 394) listed this species as a rare autumn transient, citing one definite Louisiana record for that season. On the contrary, the species is quite regular in fall. Six specimens have been collected at University, one each on September 12, 17, 18, and 28, 1940, October 22, 1942, and September 26, 1943 (Lowery and Wallace). Two others have been taken at Cameron, on October 7, 1943 (Burleigh), and September 2, 1944 (Lowery). There are numerous sight records, but since the species cannot be distinguished with certainty in the field from extremely yellow-plumaged Acadian Flycatchers, none of these is recorded.   #Empidonax traillii traillii# (Audubon), Alder Flycatcher  This species long has been regarded as an uncommon transient in Louisiana in both spring and fall. However, recent field work has shown the bird to occur regularly and sometimes abundantly in autumnal migration. Forty-one specimens have been collected at University on dates ranging from August 17 to October 5 (Lowery, _et al._). Specimens taken by Burleigh at New Orleans on September 27, 1941, and August 23, 1943, are in the Louisiana State University Museum.   #Empidonax minimus# (Baird and Baird), Least Flycatcher  Oberholser (_op. cit._, 397) listed this species as an uncommon transient since he had only a few sight records at hand. Since field identification of all eastern empidonaces in fall is open to question, our recent data, based on collected material, are significant. Six specimens have been taken at University on dates ranging from September 15 to October 5, and five at Cameron between July 25 and October 17 inclusive (Lowery, _et al._). Another specimen in the collection is that of a bird taken by Burleigh at New Orleans on October 1, 1942. There is, as yet, no unquestionable spring record for Louisiana.   #Pyrocephalus rubinus mexicanus# Sclater, Vermilion Flycatcher  Oberholser (_op. cit._, 401) listed only one record for this species, a male observed by H. E. Wallace at University, on February 6, 1938, and shot the next day by me. Since 1938, however, it has been found regularly and frequently at numerous localities in southern Louisiana in winter. At Baton Rouge, for example, an adult male was noted almost daily between October 19, 1941, and January 7, 1942, at a small pond on the University campus. An immature male was seen there also on November 25, 1941, but not thereafter. In the following autumn another adult male appeared at the same place on October 23, and was observed regularly until January 15, 1943. Again, an adult male returned to the same area on November 10, 1943, and remained until the middle of January, 1944. W. C. Abbott informs me that for several years one or two individuals have spent the winter at a small willow-bordered pond at his home near Hopevilla, Iberville Parish. Like the individuals noted at Baton Rouge, Abbott's birds arrived in October or November and remained until the following January or February. H. B. Chase, Jr., noted two individuals at City Park Lake in New Orleans in the winter of 1944-45, and three at the same place in the winter of 1945-46. I have seen the species frequently in Cameron Parish, in southwestern Louisiana, where six specimens have been collected on dates ranging from November 4 to January 22. Atwood (Auk, 60, 1943: 453) has also recorded its presence near the Laccasine Refuge in Cameron Parish. An immature male was obtained at False River, near Lakeland, in Pointe Coupee Parish, on November 8, 1942 (Burdick). E. A. McIlhenny writes me that he has seen the species many times at Avery Island and recently he sent me a skin of an adult female which he collected there on October 25, 1945 (also _cf._ McIlhenny, Auk, 52, 1935: 187). From these data it is evident that the Vermilion Flycatcher is now a regular winter visitor to southern Louisiana.   #Troglodytes troglodytes pullus# (Burleigh), Southern Winter Wren  A rather large series of Winter Wrens, all taken later than the date of publication of Oberholser's book, includes three specimens of this race and provides an addition to the state list. Two of the specimens are males collected at Baton Rouge on November 23 and December 21, 1943 (Burleigh), and the other is a male shot at the same place on January 23, 1944 (Burdick). Several additional specimens in the series are noticeably darker than the average _hiemalis_ and may have migrated from a zone of intergradation.   #Turdus migratorius nigrideus# Aldrich and Nutt, Newfoundland Robin  The only two records for the occurrence of this race in Louisiana are those of specimens taken at Baton Rouge on February 1, 1937, and February 9, 1946 (Lowery).   #Hylocichla ustulata swainsoni# (Tschudi), Eastern Olive-backed Thrush  #Hylocichla ustulata almae# Oberholser, Alma Olive-backed Thrush  Only four Louisiana specimens of the Olive-backed Thrush were available to Oberholser in 1938. He identified two as _swainsoni_ and two as _almae_. We have since collected twenty-five specimens in the state, seven of which are definitely _almae_. Of the remaining, all are clearly _swainsoni_ with the exception of a few that appear intermediate in color. The specimens of _almae_ were collected at Cameron, Baton Rouge, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34546"],["title","Additions to the List of the Birds of Louisiana (#3)"],["body","on dates ranging from April 26 to May 16 and from September 29 to October 6. The specimens of _swainsoni_ were taken at New Orleans, Port Hudson, Baton Rouge, and Baines between April 20 and May 16 and between September 12 and October 28.   #Hylocichla fuscescens salicicola# Ridgway, Willow Thrush  Oberholser (_op. cit._, 474) recorded this race as a rare spring transient on the basis of two records. However, eleven out of twenty-three recently taken specimens are referable to _salicicola_, indicating that _salicicola_ and _fuscescens_ possibly occur in approximately equal numbers, in both spring and fall. The dates on which _salicicola_ have been collected range from April 22 to May 16, and from September 14 to 27. They were taken at Cameron, Port Hudson, Baton Rouge, University, and Baines.   #Anthus spinoletta pacificus# Todd, Western Pipit  The only Louisiana record for this far western race is that of a female taken by me at Jennings, on January 3, 1943. The specimen was sent to Alden H. Miller, who compared it with material in the Museum of Vertebrate Zo√∂logy and verified the identification. As a rule, I scrutinize closely with binoculars all flocks of pipits, and as a result, on several occasions have detected pale individuals that stood out from the remainder of the flock. However, the above-mentioned specimen is the only individual so detected that I succeeded in shooting.   #Vireo solitarius alticola# Brewster, Mountain Vireo  Four specimens out of a series of twenty-eight Blue-headed Vireos taken in Louisiana since 1938 are referable to this race. It has not been recorded previously from the state. The specimens consist of a male and a female collected at Bogalusa on February 9, 1939, a male taken at Tunica on March 30, 1939, and a female at Erwinville on March 11, 1941 (Lowery).   #Helmitheros vermivorus# (Gmelin), Worm-eating Warbler  Although there are no published nesting records of this species in Louisiana, it is now known to be a common summer resident in the beech-magnolia forests of the Bayou Sara-Tunica Hills section north of St. Francisville. Jas. Hy. Bruns has supplied me with copious data on the birds seen in the nesting season at Baines, and the two of us have spent a great deal of time searching for a nest, without success. However, Bruns obtained a juvenile female, just out of a nest, on June 28, 1942.   #Seiurus aurocapillus furvior# Batchelder, Newfoundland Oven-bird  #Seiurus aurocapillus cinereus# A. H. Miller, Gray Oven-bird  Four specimens in our series of Oven-birds are identifiable without question as examples of _furvior_. Two were collected by me at University on September 15 and 25, 1940, and Tucker shot one there on September 27, 1942, and another at Cameron on April 29, 1945. There are also two specimens in the series referable to _cinereus_, as well as several that are intermediate between _cinereus_ and _S. a. aurocapillus_. Burdick shot one of the typical examples of _cinereus_ at University on September 24, 1942, and I shot the other at the same place on May 16, 1945.   #Seiurus noveboracensis noveboracensis# (Gmelin), Northern Water-thrush  #Seiurus noveboracensis limnaeus# McCabe and Miller, British Columbia Water-thrush  A. H. Miller has recently examined our large series of migrant Water-thrushes and identified three as good examples of _limnaeus_, and six as _noveboracensis_, neither one of which has been recorded previously from the state. The specimens of _limnaeus_ were taken at or near University on October 2, 1942 (Howell), October 12, 1943, and May 11, 1945 (Burleigh). The specimens of _noveboracensis_ were collected at University on September 14, 1941 (Lowery); at Baines on September 4, 1943, August 20, 1944, and May 6, 1945 (Bruns); at New Orleans on October 20, 1941 (Burleigh); and at Cameron on April 26, 1942 (Lowery).   #Geothlypis trichas occidentalis# Brewster, Western Yellow-throat  I have found it impracticable to determine subspecifically every specimen in our series of 104 Yellow-throats from Louisiana. However, two female specimens taken by me, one at Cameron on December 4, 1938, and the other on False River at Lakeland on February 11, 1941, are without doubt representatives of the race now known as _occidentalis_, a subspecies not previously recorded from this state. Several additional specimens in the series are probably also of that race, but I am deferring, for the time, recording them as such.   #Icteria virens virens# (Linnaeus), Yellow-breasted Chat  The only winter record for Louisiana is that of a female taken by me at Hackberry on January 24, 1941.   #Wilsonia pusilla pusilla# (Wilson), Wilson Warbler  The only winter record for the state is that of a female shot by T. D. Burleigh on December 20, 1944, in a thicket along the Mississippi River at University. He first found the bird at this place in November, and he saw it several times in December before he succeeded in obtaining it. Since Oberholser cited so few Louisiana records, it might be well to mention in this connection that the species is after all a fairly common fall migrant in southern Louisiana. At Baton Rouge it occurs regularly between September 11 and October 24, and at Cameron it has been noted between October 17 and November 21. There are still no spring records for southern Louisiana.   #Sturnella neglecta# Audubon, Western Meadowlark  In 1938 Oberholser cited only two Louisiana records, both from the northwestern part of the state. However, recently the species has been found in the south-central region. Two were collected at Churchill on February 11, 1941 (Lowery and Wallace), and another was shot at University on December 9, 1942 (Burdick). There are in addition several sight records, all of birds in song.   #Cassidix mexicanus prosopidicola# Lowery, Mesquite Great-tailed Grackle  I am indebted to E. A. McIlhenny for material that now permits the definite recording of this subspecies from Louisiana. On occasions during the winters of 1938, 1939, and 1940, McIlhenny sent me specimens of grackles in the flesh which he had removed from his bird-banding traps at Avery Island. Selection was based primarily on eye-color; individuals with clear yellow irises proved invariably to be examples of _prosopidicola_, whereas those with brown or yellow-brown irises were always _major_. The final basis for sub-specific identification was, however, size and plumage color. The series provided by McIlhenny consists of six females taken on November 24 and December 20, 1938, December 18, 1939, January 22 and March 5, 1940. Since the range in Texas of typical _prosopidicola_ extends eastward to within thirty miles of the Louisiana line, it is not surprising that occasional individuals or flocks wander into Louisiana in winter.   #Passerculus sandwichensis mediogriseus# Aldrich, Southeastern Savannah Sparrow  #Passerculus sandwichensis labradorius# Howe, Labrador Savannah Sparrow  #Passerculus sandwichensis nevadensis# Grinnell, Nevada Savannah Sparrow  Our series of 107 Savannah Sparrows, collected in Louisiana almost entirely since the publication of Oberholser's book, includes representatives of five geographical races, as follows: 37 _savanna_, 24 _oblitus_, 12 _mediogriseus_, 8 _labradorius_, and 7 _nevadensis_. The remaining 19 specimens show various combinations of characters and appear to be intergrades, and so have not been assigned definitely to any one race. I am indebted to James L. Peters for the identification of most of our specimens. Since _mediogriseus_ and _labradorius_ have not been reported previously from Louisiana, and since there is only one Louisiana record of _nevadensis_ (Miles, Auk, 60, 1943: 606-607), actual dates and localities of occurrence for these races are listed here. _P. s. mediogriseus_ (specimens by Burdick, Howell, Lowery, Ray, Tucker, and Wallace)--University, January 31, 1939; February 11 and 29, April 29, November 28, and December 16, 1940; December 6 and 7, 1941; October 10 and 25, 1942; April 14, 1943. Erwinville, March 11, 1941. _P. s. labradorius_ (specimens by Burleigh, Lowery, McIlhenny, Ray and Wallace)--University, February 15 and November 8, 1940; January 1, 1941; December 11, 1943. 2 mi. NE Baton Rouge, January 1, 1941. Burtville, December 8, 1939. Avery Island, May 3, 1939. Lake Charles, November 20, 1940. _P. s. nevadensis_ (specimens by Burdick, Lowery, and Wallace)--Iowa Station, January 23 and 24, 1940. University, February 10 and March 10, 1940. University, December 7, 1941, and November 15, 1942. Cameron, December 6, 1942. There are at present no _bona fide_ records of _P. s. anthinus_ in Louisiana, since the one recorded example of that race (Oberholser, _op. cit._, 647) appears, on re√´xamination, to be referable to _savanna_ (_fide_ J. L. Peters).   #Ammodramus savannarum pratensis# Vieillot, Eastern Grasshopper Sparrow  Eight specimens of the Grasshopper Sparrow taken recently in Louisiana are without exception referable to _pratensis_. Our one remaining specimen, a male collected at Pride on December 19, 1937, is an example of _perpallidus_ as recorded by Oberholser (_op. cit._, 648). Although the present series is inadequate for determining the prevailing form in the state in the winter, it would appear that _pratensis_ is more common, rather than _perpallidus_ as indicated by Oberholser.   #Chondestes grammacus strigatus# Swainson, Western Lark Sparrow  Oberholser cited only one Louisiana record for this race. The following additional records are now available: a specimen was taken by Howell at Cameron on October 31, 1942, and one was obtained by me at University on April 13, 1945. The species is a transient in both localities. A supplementary winter record for the Lark Sparrow in Louisiana is that of an individual seen at Port Hudson on December 23, 1945, by Howell and Newman. The bird was shot, but unfortunately, it was not retrieved.   #Junco hyemalis cismontanus# Dwight, Cassiar Junco  The only specimen in our "]]]
