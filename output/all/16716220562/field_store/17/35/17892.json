DUELLMAN   At the time of completing my study of the genus _Leptodeira_ (1958) I had seen no specimens of _Leptodeira discolor_, a species described by Günther in 1860 and subsequently referred to the genus _Hypsiglena_ by Cope (1887), Boulenger (1894), and Mocquard (1908), and to the genus _Pseudoleptodeira_ by Taylor (1938). Günther's description was based on two syntypes (British Museum of Natural History numbers 1946.1.23.67 and 68) collected in Oaxaca, México, by Auguste Sallé. Information concerning the scutellation and coloration of the syntypes was provided by J. C. Battersby; in my revisionary study (_op. cit._) this information was included in a short discussion of the species, which was referred to _incerta sedis_ until specimens could be examined and the relationships of the species determined.  Through the courtesy of John M. Legler of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, I have been able to study a specimen of _Leptodeira discolor_ obtained six miles southeast of Tamazulápam, Oaxaca, México, by J. R. Alcorn on June 22, 1955. Superficial examination of the external characters of this snake shows a striking resemblance to _Leptodeira_. The specimen has a vertical pupil, divided anal, 21 scale rows, and two apical pits. The enlarged posterior maxillary teeth are without a trace of a groove. Examination of the hemipenis revealed that the organ was bifurcate and had a forked sulcus; these penial characteristics are diagnostic of the subfamily Xenodontinae and not the subfamily Colubrinae that includes the genera _Hypsiglena_ and _Leptodeira_.  Examination of all available xenodontine genera indicates that this snake belongs to a heretofore unnamed genus. In recognition of the mental torment customarily suffered by workers attempting to ascertain the relationships of the many genera of colubrid snakes, I propose the generic name       _Tantalophis_, new genus       _Leptodeira_ (in part), Günther, Proc.

London, pp. 317-318, 1860.       _Diagnosis._--A xenodontine colubrid snake having a bifurcate      hemipenis with a forked sulcus spermaticus, many longitudinal folds      on basal portion, and small spines and calyces on distal part; 12      or 13 maxillary teeth followed by short diastema and two somewhat      enlarged maxillary teeth lacking grooves; small parotid gland;      normal colubrid skull; no hypapophyses on posterior vertebrae;      elliptical pupils; two apical pits; smooth scales; normal colubrid      head shields; divided anal; paired caudals.       The generic name comes from the Greek Tantalos, a mythological      character symbolic of eternal torment, and from the Greek ophis      for snake.       _Tantalophis discolor_ (Günther) New comb.       The synonymy for the species is indicated in the account of the      genus. The description below of the species is based on an adult      male from 6 miles southeast of Tamazulápam, Oaxaca, México      (University of Kansas Museum of Natural History No. 40143).       _Scutellation._--Head shields normal; upper labials 7-7 (third and      fourth entering orbit); lower labials 9-9 (1-4 in contact with      anterior chin-shield, 4 and 5 in contact with posterior      chin-shield); preoculars 1-1 and not in contact with frontal;      postoculars 2-2; temporals 1-2-3, 1-2-3; nasals divided by a      distinct groove below nostril and faint groove above; portion of      rostral visible from above, one-third length of internasals;      internasals pentagonal and one-half as long as prefrontals;      parietal suture approximately as long as frontal; ventrals 178;      anal divided; caudals 80. Scales in 21 rows at midbody and showing      the following reduction:              2 + 3 (130)         8 + 9 (162)       21  ---------------  19  --------------  17 (178)             2 + 3 (130)         8 + 9 (152)       _Coloration._--Dorsal ground-color light brown and extending onto      edges of ventrals; transverse body blotches numbering 50, each      1-1/2 to 3 scales long and separated by light interspaces 1-1/2 to      2 scales long; blotches brownish black and extending onto second      scale row; lateral intercalary spots forming dark smudges on rows 1      and 2. Top of head black, flecked with tan; nape cream, followed by      dark band six scales long; dark nape stripe from posterior edges of      parietals to first dark body band. Venter cream-tan; throat and      labials cream; posterior margins of all upper labials and of lower      labials 1-3 black-edged (Figure 1).       _Size and Proportions._--Head and body 312 mm. long; tail 118 mm.,      amounting to 37.8 per cent of length of head and body.       _Variation._--Data on the syntypes of _Leptodeira discolor_      furnished by J. C. Battersby give some indication of the variation      in the species. Both are males, and they have 175 and 180 ventrals,      88 and 89 caudals, 1 preocular, 2 postoculars, 1-2-3 temporals, 7      and 8 upper labials, 9 lower labials. They have body lengths of      365 and 402 mm., total lengths of 509 and 555 mm., tail/body ratios      of 38.0 and 39.4. They have 51 and 54 dark blotches on the body.       [Illustration: Fig. 1. Dorsal and lateral views of the head of      _Tantalophis discolor_ (Günther). (KU No. 40143). × 7.]       _Skull._--The skull is typically colubrid and shows no      modifications. The quadrate has both a median and a lateral      depression, forming a strong lateral flange on the anterior edge;      the columellar process is elliptical, and the supra-columellar      crest is robust. The posteroinferior vomerine process extends      directly posteriorly and then angles sharply posterodorsally,      enclosing an elliptical vomerine fenestra. The lateral processes of      the premaxillary are slightly pointed; the median spine is      relatively thin and high. The pterygoids bear 23 and 21 teeth that      decrease in size posteriorly; the transpalatine articulating      process of the pterygoid is rounded, not robust; the lateral crest      is high and moderately robust; the depression in the ventral      surface of the pterygoid is moderate. There are 12 and 13 maxillary      teeth that increase in size posteriorly; these are followed by a      short diastema and two larger, solid teeth. The prediastemal teeth      are slightly curved and slender. The maxillary is laterally      compressed; the posterior knob is not robust; there is one foramen      in the lateral face of the bone (Figure 2). The 10 palatine teeth      are almost uniform in size; the dentary bears 19 teeth that      decrease in size posteriorly.       [Illustration: Fig. 2. Lateral view of the left maxillary of      _Tantalophis discolor_ (Günther). (KU No. 40143). × 17.]       A thin and otherwise small parotid gland or \"venom sac\" extends      posteriorly from beneath the eye to about the angle of the jaw; a      minute duct connects with the anteromedian surface and extends to      the fleshy part of the mouth at the posterior end of the maxillary      (Figure 3).       [Illustration: Fig. 3. Lateral view of the head of _Tantalophis      discolor_ (Günther), showing the position and relative size of the      parotid gland. (KU No. 40143). × 3.]       _Hemipenis._--In _situ_ the hemipenis extends to the posterior edge      of the thirteenth caudal. The unforked part of the organ is      bedecked with numerous heavy longitudinal folds alternating with      thinner folds. The basal parts of the two heads are covered with      moderate sized spines, those closest to the base and the sulcus      being the smallest. The distal parts of the heads are covered with      calyces. The sulcus bifurcates on the unforked part of the organ at      a point about two-thirds of the distance from the base to the      division of the organ. The sulcus is a deep groove between heavy      folds proximally and is a shallower furrow distally (Figure 4).       [Illustration: Fig. 4. Hemipenis of _Tantalophis discolor_      (Günther). The organ was cut on the ventral surface and opened.      (KU No. 40143). × 4.]  _Relationships._--Using Dunn's (1928) arrangement of the American colubrid snakes as a guide permits the taxonomist to group _Tantalophis_ with several genera, some of which occur in South America and others in the West Indies.
