His fingers promptly closed with a reassuring grasp on hers, and thus skimming the red sunset-tide they left behind them the staring group about the blacksmith shop, which the cavalrymen had now approached, watering their horses at the trough and lifting the saddles to rest the animals from the constriction of the pressure of the girths.  Soon the guerilla and the girl disappeared in the distance; the fences flew by; the shocks of corn seemed all a-trooping down the fields; the evening star in the red haze above the purple western mountains had spread its invisible pinions, and was a-wing above their heads. Presently the heavy shadows of the looming wooded range, darkening now, showing only blurred effects of red and brown and orange, fell upon them, and the guerilla checked the pace, for the horse was among boulders and rough ledges that betokened the dry bed of a stream. Great crags had begun to line the way, first only on one marge of the channel; then the clifty banks appeared on the other side, and at length a deep, black-arched opening yawned beneath the mountains, glooming with sepulchral shadows; in the silence one might hear drops trickling vaguely and the sudden hooting of an owl from within.  He drew up his horse abruptly, and contemplated the grim aperture.  \"So they came into Tanglefoot down the road, and went out of the Cove by this tunnel?\"  \"Yessir!\" she piped. What had befallen her voice? what appalled eerie squeak was this! She cleared her throat timorously. \"They couldn't hev done it later in the fall season. Tanglefoot Creek gits ter runnin' with the fust rains.\"  \"An' Tolhurst knew that too! He must have had a guide--a guide that knows the Cove like I know the palm of my hand! Well, I'll catch him yet, sometime. I'll hang him! I'll hang him--if I have to grow a tree a-purpose.\"  What strange influence had betided the landscape? Around and around circled the great stationary mountains anchored in the foundations of the earth. It was a long moment before they were still again--perhaps, indeed, it was the necessity of guarding her balance on the fiery steed, a new cause of apprehension, that paradoxically steadied Ethelinda's nerves. Ackert had dismounted, throwing the reins over his arm. He had caught sight of the hoofmarks along the moist sandy spaces of the channel, mute witness in point of number, and a guaranty of the truth of her story. A sudden glitter arrested his eyes. He stooped and picked up a broken belt-buckle with the significant initials U.S. yet showing upon it.  \"I'll hang that guide yet,\" he muttered, his eyes dark with angry conviction, his face lowering with fury. \"I'll hang him--I won't expect to prove it p'int blank. Jes' let me git a mite o' suspicion, an' I'll guarantee the slipknot!\"  She could never understand her motive, her choice of the moment.  \"Cap'n Ackert,\" she trembled forth. There was so much significance in her tone that, standing at her side, he looked up in sudden expectation. \"I tole ye the truth whenst I say I _seen_ no guide\"--he made a gesture of impatience; he had no time for twice-told tales--\"kase--kase the guide war--war--myself.\"  The clear twilight fell full on his amazed, upturned face and the storm of fury it concentrated.  \"What did you do it fur?\" he thundered, \"you limb o' perdition!\"  \"Jes' ter help him some. He--he--he--would hev been capshured.\"  He would indeed! The guerilla was very terrible to look upon as his brow corrugated, and his upturned eyes, with the light of the sky within them, flashed ominously.  \"You little she-devil!\" he cried, and then speech seemed to fail him.  She had begun to shiver and shed tears and emit little gusts of quaking sobs.  \"Oh, I be so feared----\" she whimpered. \"But--but--you mustn't hang--_nobody else_ on s'picion!\"  There was a vague change in the expression of his face. He still stood beside the saddle, with the reins over his arm, while the horse threw his head almost to the ground and again tossed it aloft in his impatient weariness of the delay.  \"An' now you are captured yourself,\" he said, sternly. \"You are accountable fur your actions.\"  She burst into a paroxysm of sobs. \"I never went ter tell! I meant ter keep the secret! The folks in the Cove dun'no' nuthin'. But--oh, ye _mustn't_ s'picion nobody else--ye _mustn't_ hang nobody else!\"  Once more that indescribable change upon his face.  \"You showed him the way to this pass yourself? Tell the truth!\"  \"He war ridin' his horse-critter--'tain't ez fast, nor fine, nor fat ez yourn.\"  He stroked the glossy mane with a sort of mechanical pride.  \"And so he went plumb through the cave?\"  \"An' all the troop--they kindled pine-knots fur torches.\"  He glanced about him at the convenient growths.  \"And they came out all safe in Greenbrier?\" He winced. How the lost opportunity hurt him!  \"Yessir. In Greenbrier Cove.\"  \"Did he pay you in gold?\" sneered Ackert. \"Or in greenbacks? Or mebbe in Cornfed money?\"  \"I wouldn't hev his gold.\" She drew herself up proudly, though the tears were still coursing down her cheeks. \"So he gin me a present--a whole passel o' coffee in my milk-piggin.\" Then to complete a candid confession she detailed the disposition she had made of this rare and precious luxury at the rebel smallpox camp.  His eyes seemed to dilate as they gazed up at her. \"Jesus Gawd!\" he exclaimed, with uncouth profanity. But the phrase was unfamiliar to her, and she caught at it with a meaning all her own.  \"That's jes' it! Folks in gineral don't think o' _them_,'cept ter git out o' thar way; an' nobody keers fur _them_, but kase Jesus _is_ Gawd He makes _somebody_ remember them wunst in a while! An' they did seem passable glad.\"  A vague sweet fragrance was on the vesperal air; some subtle distillation of asters or jewel-weed or \"mountain-snow,\" and the leafage of crimson sumac and purple sweet-gum and yellow hickory and the late ripening frost-grapes--all in the culmination of autumnal perfection; more than one star gleamed whitely palpitant in a sky that was yet blue and roseate with a reminiscence of sunset; a restful sentiment, a brief truce stilled the guerilla's tempestuous pulse as he continued to stand beside his horse's head while the girl waited, seated on the saddle blanket.  Suddenly he spoke to an unexpected intent. \"Ye took a power o' risk in goin' nigh that Confederate pest-camp--an' yit ye're fur the Union an' saved a squadron from capture!\" he upbraided the inconsistency in a soft incidental drawl.  \"Yes, I be fur the Union,\" she trembled forth the dread avowal. \"But somehows I can't keep from holpin' any I kin. They war rebs--an' it war Yankee coffee--an' I dun'no'--I jes' dun'no'----\"  As she hesitated he looked long at her with that untranslated gaze. Then he fell ponderingly silent.  Perhaps the revelation of the sanctities of a sweet humanity for a holy sake, blessing and blessed, had illumined his path, had lifted his eyes, had wrought a change in his moral atmosphere spiritually suffusive, potent, revivifying, complete. \"She is as good as the saints in the Bible--an' plumb beautiful besides,\" he muttered beneath his fierce mustachios.  Once more he gazed wonderingly at her.  \"I expect to do some courtin' in this kentry when the war is over,\" the guerilla said, soberly, reaching down to readjust the reins. \"I haven't got time now. Will _you_ be waiting fur me here in Tanglefoot Cove--if I promise not to hang you fur your misdeeds right off now?\" He glanced up with a sudden arch jocularity.  She burst out laughing gleefuly in the tumult of her joyous reassurance, as she laid her tremulous fingers in his big gauntlet when he insisted that they should shake hands as on a solemn compact. Forthwith he mounted again, and the great charger galloped back, carrying double, in the red after-glow of the sunset, to the waiting group before the flaring doors of the forge.  The fine flower of romance had blossomed incongruously in that eager heart in those fierce moments of the bitterness of defeat. Life suddenly had a new meaning, a fair and fragrant promise, and often and again he looked over his shoulder at the receding scene when the trumpets sang \"to horse,\" and in the light of the moon the guerilla rode out of Tanglefoot Cove.  But Ethelinda saw him never again. All the storms of fate overwhelmed the Confederacy with many a rootless hope and many a plan and pride. In lieu of the materialization of the stalwart ambition of distinction that had come to dominate his life, responsive to the discovery of his peculiar and inherent gifts, his destiny was chronicled in scarce a line of the printed details of a day freighted with the monstrous disaster of a great battle; in common with others of the \"missing\" his bones were picked by the vultures till shoved into a trench, where a monument rises to-day to commemorate an event and not a commander. Nevertheless, for many years the flare of the first red leaves in the cleft among the pines on the eastern slope of Tanglefoot Cove brought to Ethelinda's mind the gay flutter of the guidon, and in certain sonorous blasts of the mountain wind she could hear martial echoes of the trumpets of the guerilla.     WHO CROSSES STORM MOUNTAIN?   The wind stirred in the weighted pines; the snow lay on the ground. Here and there on its smooth, white expanse footprints betokened the woodland gentry abroad. In the pallid glister of the moon, even amid the sparse, bluish shadows of the leafless trees, one might discriminate the impression of the pronged claw of the wild turkey, the short, swift paces of the mink, the padded, doglike paw of the wolf. A progress of a yet more ravening suggestion was intimated in great hoofmarks leading to the door of a little log cabin all a-crouch in the grim grip of winter and loneliness and poverty on the slope of the mountain, among heavy, outcropping ledges of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33970"],["title","The Raid of The Guerilla, and Other Stories (#5)"],["body","and beetling, overhanging crags. With icy ranges all around as far as the eye could reach, with the vast, instarred, dark sky above, it might seem as if sorrow, the world, the law could hardly take account of so slight a thing, so remote. But smoke was slowly stealing up from its stick-and-clay chimney, and its clapboarded roof sheltered a group with scarcely the heart to mend the fire.  Two women shivered on the broad hearth before the dispirited embers. One had wept so profusely that she had much ado to find a dry spot in her blue-checked apron, thrown over her head, wherewith to mop her tears. The other, much younger, her fair face reddened, her blue eyes swollen, her auburn curling hair all tangled on her shoulders, her voice half-choked with sobs, addressed herself to the narration of their woes, her cold, listless hands clasped about her knees as she sat on an inverted bushel-basket, for there was not a whole chair in the room.  \"An' then he jes' tuk an' leveled!\" she faltered.  A young hunter standing on the threshold, leaning on his rifle, a brace of wild turkeys hanging over his shoulders, half a dozen rabbits dangling from his belt, stared at her through the dull, red glow of the fading fire in amazed agitation.  \"What did he level, Medory--a gun?\"  \"Wuss'n that!\" replied the younger woman. \"He leveled the weepon o' the law!\"  The man turned to look again at the curious disarray of the room. \"The law don't allow him to do sech ez this!\" he blurted out in rising anger. \"Why, everything hyar is bodaciously broke an' busted! War it the sheriff himself ez levied?\"  \"'Twar jes' the dep'ty critter, Clem Tweed,\" explained Medora, \"mighty jokified, an' he 'peared ter be middlin' drunk, an' though he said su'thin' 'bout exemptions he 'lowed ez we-uns lived at the eend o' the world.\"  Her mother-in-law suddenly lowered the apron from her face.  \"'The jumpin'-off place,' war what Clem Tweed called it!\" she interpolated with a fiery eye of indignant reminiscence.  \"He did! He did!\" Medora bitterly resented this fling at the remoteness of their poor home. \"An' he said whilst hyar he'd level on everything in sight, ez he hoped never ter travel sech roads agin--everything in sight, even the baby an' the cat!\"  \"Shucks, Medory, ye know the dep'ty man war funnin' whenst he said that about the baby an' the cat! Ye know ez Clem admitted he hed Christmas in his bones!\" the elder objected.  \"Waal, war Clem Tweed funnin' whenst he done sech ez that, in levyin' an execution?\" Bruce Gilhooley pointed with his ramrod at the wreck of the furniture.  The two women burst into lugubrious sobs and rocked themselves back and forth in unison. \"'Twar _Dad_!\" Medora moaned, in smothered accents.  A pause of bewilderment ensued. Then the young man's face took on an expression of dismay so ominous that Medora's tears were checked in the ghastly fear of disasters yet to come to her father-in-law. Now and again she glanced anxiously over her shoulder at an oblong black aperture in the dusk which betokened the open door of the shed-room. Some one lurked there, evidently cherishing all aloof a grief, an anger, a despair too poignant to share.  \"Dad warn't hyar whenst the dep'ty leveled,\" she said. \"An' mighty glad we war--kase somebody mought hev got hurt. But whenst Dad kem home an' larnt the news he jes'--he jes'--he jes' lept about like a painter.\"  \"He did! He did!\" asseverated a voice from the veiled head, all muffled in the checked apron.  \"Dad 'lowed,\" continued Medora, \"ez Peter Petrie hev persecuted and druv him ter the wall. Fust he tricked Dad out'n some unoccupied lan' what Dad hed begun ter clear, an' Petrie got it entered fust an' tuk out a grant an' holds the title! An' whenst Dad lay claim ter it Peter Petrie declared ef enny Gilhooley dared ter cross Storm Mounting he'd break every bone in his body!\"  \"A true word--the insurance of the critter!\" came from the blue-checked veil.  A stir in the shed-room--a half-suppressed cough and a clearing of the throat.  \"An' then Dad fell on Pete Petrie at the Crossroads' store, whar the critter hed stopped with his mail-pouch, an' Dad trounced him well afore all the crowd o' loafers thar!\"  \"Bless the Lord, he did!\" the checked apron voiced a melancholy triumph.  \"An' then, ye remember whenst Dad set out fire in the woods las' fall ter burn off the trash on his own lan', the flames run jes' a leetle over his line an' on ter them woods on Storm Mounting, doin' no harm ter nobody, nor nuthin'!\"  \"Not a mite--not a mite,\" asseverated the apron.  \"An' ez sech appears ter be agin the law Petrie gin information an' Dad war fined five dollars!\"  \"An' paid it!\" cried Jane Gilhooley. \"Ye know that!\"  \"An' then, ez it 'pears ter be the law ez one hundred dollars fur sech an offense is ter be forfeited ter ennybody ez will sue fur it,\" Medora resumed, \"Petrie seen his chance ter git even fur bein' beat in a reg'lar knock-down-an'-drag-out fight, an',\" with the rising inflection of a climax, \"he hev sued and got jedgmint!\"  \"An' so what that half-drunk dep'ty, Clem Tweed, calls an execution war leveled!\" exclaimed Jane Gilhooley, her veiled head swaying forlornly as she sobbed invisibly.  \"But Dad 'lowed ez Peter Petrie shouldn't hev none o' his gear,\" Medora's eyes flashed with a responsive sentiment.  \"His gran'mam's warpin' bars!\" suggested the elder woman.  \"The spinnin'-wheels she brung from No'th Carliny,\" enumerated Medora, \"the loom an' the candle-moulds.\"  \"The cheers his dad made fur his mam whenst they begun housekeepin',\" said Jane Gilhooley's muffled voice.  \"The press an' the safe,\" Medora continued.  \"The pot an' the oven,\" chokingly responded the apron.  \"The churn an' the piggins!\"  \"The skillet an' the trivet!\"  Medora, fairly flinching from the inventory of all the household goods, so desecrated and \"leveled on,\" returned to the salient incident of the day. \"Dad jes' tuk an axe an' bust up every yearthly thing in the house!\"  \"An' now we-uns ain't got nuthin'.\" The elder woman looked about in stunned dismay, her little black eyes a mere gleam of a pupil in the midst of their swollen lids and network of wrinkles.  One of the miseries of the very ignorant is, paradoxically, the partial character of their privation. If the unknown were to them practically non-existent they might find solace in sluggish and secure content. But even the smallest circle of being touches continually the periphery of wider spheres. The air is freighted with echoes of undistinguished sounds. Powers, illimitable, absolute, uncomprehended, seem to hold an inimical sway over their lives and of these the most dreaded is the benign law, framed for their protection, spreading above them an unperceived, unimagined aegis. Thus there was hardly an article in the house which was not exempt by statute from execution, and the house itself and land worth only a hundred or two dollars were protected by the homestead law. The facetious deputy, Clem Tweed, with \"Christmas in his bones,\" would have committed a misdemeanor in seriously levying upon them. He had held the affair as a capital farce--even affecting with wild, appropriating gambols to seize the baby and the cat--and fully realized that malice only had prompted the whole proceeding, to humiliate Ross Gilhooley and illustrate the completeness of the victory which Peter Petrie had won over his enemy.  The younger Gilhooley, however, quaked as his limited intelligence laid hold on the fact that if the law had permitted a levy on the household goods to satisfy the judgment of Peter Petrie their destruction was in itself a balking of the process, resistance to the law, and with an unimagined penalty.  \"We-uns hev got ter git away from hyar somehows!\" he said with decision.  The idea of bluff Ross Gilhooley in the clutches of the law because of one fierce moment of goaded and petulant despair, with the ignominy of a criminal accusation, with all the sordid concomitants of arrest and the jail, was infinitely terrible to his unaccustomed imagination. He revolted from its contemplation with a personal application. For an honest man, however poor, feels all the high prerogatives of honor.  There was a step in the shed-room where Ross Gilhooley had lurked and listened. His wrath now spent, his mind had traveled the obvious course to his son's conclusion. He stood a gigantic, bearded shadow in the doorway, half ashamed, wholly repentant, dimly, vaguely fearful, and all responsive and quivering to the idea of flight. \"I been studyin' some 'bout goin' ter Minervy Sue's in Georgy,\" he said creakingly, as if his voice had suffered from its unwonted disuse.  \"An' none too soon,\" said Bruce doggedly. \"The oxen is Medory's, bein' lef' ter her whenst her dad died, an' the wagin is mine! Quit foolin' along o' that thar fire, Medory!\" For with her bright hair hanging curling over her cheeks his young wife had leaned forward to start it anew.  \"Never ter kindle it agin on this ha'th-stone!\" she cried with a poignant realization of the significance of the uprooting of the roof-tree and the wide, vague world without. And still once more the two women fell to bemoaning their fate of exile beside the expiring embers, while the elder Gilhooley's voice sounded bluffly outside calling the oxen, and his son was rattling their heavy yoke in the corner.  They were well advanced on their journey ere yet the snowy Christmas dawn was in the sky. So slow a progress was ill-associated with the idea of flight. It was almost noiseless--the great hoofs of the oxen fell all muffled on the deep snow still whitely a-glitter with the moon, hanging dense and opaque in the western sky, and flecked with the dendroidal images of the overshadowing trees. The immense bovine heads swayed to and fro, cadenced to the deliberate pace, and more than once a muttered low of distaste and protest rose with the vapor curling upward from lip and nostril into the icy air. On the front seat of the cumbrous, white,"]]]
