I'll go a tip-toe over him, you see if I don't.  I often cleans boots for gents as has corns, and I'm used to 'em, and--\"  \"Yah-h-h-h,\" I shrieked, for it was impossible to help it, and at the same moment brought down my umbrella fiercely on the little scoundrel's head.  Fancy my feelings all you who suffer, for it must have been done purposely; just as the young ruffian was grinding away with an abomination of a hard brush--a very hard brush, so hard that there was more wood than bristles--he looked up at me and grinned while I was perspiring with fear and pain, and then with one furious stroke he caught the edge of his brush right upon the apex of Mount Agony, causing me to shriek, seize my half-cleaned boot with both hands, and dance round upon one leg regardless of appearances, and to the extreme delight of the collecting crowd.  \"Don't you do that agen, now come,\" whimpered the boy, guarding his head with both arms, and smearing his black countenance where a few tears trickled down.  \"You dog!\"  I shouted; \"I'll--I'll--I'll--\"  \"Oh, ah!  I dessay you will,\" whined the boy; \"I never said nothin' to you.  Why don't you pull off your boots then, and not go a-knockin' me about?\"  Of course I hurried away with my boots half-cleaned, and so I have to hurry through life--a miserable man, suffering unheard-of torment, but with no one to pity me.  Time back, people would ask what ailed me, but now they \"pooh, pooh\" my troubles, since it is only my corns.  I would not care if people would tread upon me anywhere else, but they won't, and I feel now reduced to my last hope.  Did not somebody once say, \"Great oaks from little acorns grow--great aches from little toe-corns grow\"?  How true--how telling!  But there, I give up, with the determination to bear my pains as I can, for I feel assured that no one will sympathise with me who does not suffer from corns.    CHAPTER THREE.  A GHASTLY DEED.    In Portsmouth harbour the good ship lay,   Her cruising ended for many a day,   And gathered on deck while receiving their pay,       The sailors most thickly were mustered.   The Jews on the wharves were all eagerly bent   On supplying poor Jack, while most likely by scent,   There were sharks by the score   On all parts of the shore.   Both he sharks and she sharks enough, ay and more,   To devour poor Jack,   When they made their attack,       And there on the land they all clustered.    Only think; from a cruise of four years returned,   And paid in clean money!  No wonder it burned,   And Jack's canvass pockets were ready to give.   But, there: not so ready as Jack who would live   To the top of his income--the very main truck,   And when to the bottom of pocket, why luck,   Would never turn back   On poor happy-faced Jack,   Who never said die   In his life.  And would try   To face any storm if his officers spoke,   Or the wildest of sights that the hurricane woke.    Now Dick Sprit was a sailor,   Tight and bold in a gale or   A storm.  He would cheer in a fight,   'Mid the bullets' flight,   And sooner than hear any praise or flattery,   Would have run his head in a \"Rooshun\" battery.   Now Dick his pockets had ten times slapped,   His fingers snapped, and his trousers clapped;   He had thought of his home and the Christmas-time,   The long shore days 'mid the frosty rime.   He had gone on shore, run the gauntlet well,   'Scaped the Jews' oiled words and the grog-shops' smell.   The night was cold and the way was dark,   What mattered when Dick was free of his bark,   And with kit on his back, and stick in his fist,   His pay in his pocket, and cheek full of twist,   He started off for his six miles' tramp   To his native spot, spite of snow or damp.    Dick twisted his twist, and he flourished his stick,   And vowed he could fourteen footpads lick,   For in war or in peace, a scrimmage or spar   Is heartily welcome to every tar.   The night was cold and the way was dark,   And the town lights shone here and there like a spark,   As merrily on through the snow Dick tramped,   Though he certainly wished that the way were lamped.       But what was that when with four years' pay,       And a leave of absence for many a day,       With the old folks waiting their boy to meet,       Their sailor lad who, now fleet of feet,       Hurried along o'er the crunching snow,       As the thoughts of home made his heart to glow.    Some three miles past, and the sailor now   Paused by a hedge where the holly bough   Grew thick and dense, and though dim the night   There were memories many within that sight,   For the days of old came hurrying by,   And that Christmas past when he said good-bye;   While then came the thoughts of years soon sped,   Of the distant climes and the blood he'd shed,   Of the battles with storms in the ocean wild,   Of the torrid heat or the breezes mild.   But now once more he was nearing home   After his four years' tiring roam;   And with bounding heart how the night he blest,   And thought of the coming days of rest.    Some three miles past, when his blood was chilled   By a shriek which through every muscle thrilled;   He stood for a moment, and then could hear   The sounds of a struggle and trampling near;   Panting and sobs, as of mortal fight,   While from over a hedge gleamed rays of light.   Dick's feelings were wrought to the highest pitch;   His bundle he dropped, gave his slack a hitch,   Then tightening his grasp of his sapling oak,   With a bounding rush through the hedge he broke,   When hard by a cottage a lanthorn's light   Cast its flickering rays on a ghastly sight:   With gory features and blade in hand   Two ruffians stooped and their victim scanned;   As over the struggling form they leant,   Dick paused no more, but his sapling went,   Cut one--cut two on each villain's head,   Thud like the fall of a pestle of lead,   And then they fell with a deep drawn groan,   While Dick leaned forward on hearing a moan,   But suddenly turning, he ran like mad,   And breathlessly muttered, \"'Twas really too bad.   Be blest if he ever did see such a rig   As to topper two lubbers for killing a pig!\"    And Dick was right, for 'twas really no joke,   Though our sailor lad here had no \"pig in a poke;\"   But though courage should merit the best of our praise,   There's a certain fair maiden whose limpid eyes' rays   Should be shed on our mind when we think to engage,   And not in our hurry go blind in our rage;   Discretion should lead us, or else every whit,   We may turn out as blind as the sailor--Dick Sprit.    CHAPTER FOUR.  COME BACK.  \"Ha-ha-ha-ha! ha-ha-ha!\" laughed Shadrach--Shadrach Pratt, light porter at Teman, Sundry, and Sope's, the wholesale and retail grocers in the City.  \"Ha-ha-ha!\" laughed Shadrach, stopping, with one foot on the wet pavement and the other in the snowy slush of the kennel, to slap his thigh, and say: \"That's a good 'un, that is--`What do the Arabs of the desert live on? the sand which is there.'  That _is_ a good one, rale grit.  Ha-ha-ha!\" laughed the little man.  \"I'll ask 'em that after dinner to-morrow.\"  Who'd have thought, to see the little fellow go skipping along through the wet, splashy snow, that there were holes in the sides of his boots, and that one sole had given up the stitches that morning and gone off, being not buried, but suffering the fiery ordeal of burning, curling about upon its funereal pyre as though still alive?  Who'd have thought that he had had no dinner this Christmas-eve, and was now off, post-haste, to his home in Bermondsey (_pronounced_ Bummonsey), to get dinner and tea together--a hot meal of bloater and bread-and-butter-- with orders to be back in an hour at the latest? for it was busy tide with the firm, and whatever Shadrach's duty may have been at other times, he was heavy porter now decidedly.  Over the bridge, round the corner, down by Tooley Street warehouses, famed for suffering from an ailment that must amongst buildings answer to the Saint Anthony's fire of the human being; down past sacking, sailcloth, and rope warehouses; and down past marine stores, and miseries enough to give a man an ultramarine tint; and then home in the pleasant and unsalubrious locality of Snow's Fields.  Snow there was in plenty--muddy, slushy snow; but the only field visible was a large field for improvement; but then, as Shadrach said, \"How handy for business!\"  \"Here's father!\" was the cry, as the little man rushed in, hugged his wife, and had his legs hugged at the same time; and then he was in the warm place by the tea-tray, toasting his steaming boots, and watching the water being poured into the hissing, hot earthen teapot.  \"Now, then,\" said Mrs Pratt, \"they've all had their teas; and you're not to touch them, or give them a scrap.  But have you had your dinner?\"  \"No,\" said Shadrach; \"only stayed my stomach with half a pint of four ale and a hot tater, at one; but I've brought a bloat--There, bless my soul!  I always did say the tail of your coat is not a safe place, and if I ain't been setting upon it.  What a good job it was a hard-roed 'un.  Not hurt a bit.  Who'll toast it?\"  \"Me--me--me!\" chorussed some six or seven voices; and then the most substantial-looking of the family was picked out, and she began toasting till the fish began to curl its head and tail together, when the toaster happening to turn her head"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34665"],["title","Christmas Penny Readings: Original Sketches for the Season (#6)"],["body"," watch the distribution of \"dog's bits\" (ie scraps of bread-and-butter), the bloater glided from the fork, and had to be picked from the ashes and wiped.  But it was not so very gritty when done, and only made Shadrach think about the Arabs and the sandwiches; though, after distributing so many scraps, father's share of bloater, or grit, was not large; and then up jumped the refreshed head of the family, and prepared for another start.  \"'Tain't much, eighteen shillings a week, with a family, is it?\" said Shadrach, counting the money out in his wife's hand; \"but, never mind, there's lots worse off.\"  Mrs Pratt gave a shrug, as much as to say, \"And lots better.\"  But, smiling again, she told what preparations had been made towards the next day.  \"There, I can't stop,\" said Shadrach; \"you must do it all.  Goose, you know!  Wait till it's quite late at Leadenhall, and then you'll get it cheap.  They can't sell them all out.\"  Mrs Pratt seemed to think that the goose would make a fearful hole in eighteen shillings.  \"There's coals, and grosheries, and vegetables, and bread, and butter; and Ginger's boots are in a sad state, and--and--\"  Certainly, Ginger's boots were in a sad state; but that was not of much consequence, according to the Countess de Noailles; and if she advocated bare feet amidst the aristocracy, she would have little pity for Ginger--domus name of Mr Pratt's fourth son; for Shadrach was given to nicknaming his children in accordance with the common objects of his life: hence \"Ginger,\" \"Pepper,\" and \"Spicy\" were familiar terms for as many children.  \"But didn't I, eh?--the Christmas-box?\" said Shadrach, pinching his chin and looking innocent.  \"Why, an old cheat!\" cried Mrs Pratt, rushing to the door, and finding a brown paper parcel resting behind the bulky umbrella upon her clogs; and then, amidst a volley of cheers, bearing it to the table, which was directly surrounded by chairs, climbed upon by an escalading party, and it was only by dint of great presence of mind that Mrs Pratt saved the brown paper citadel by hurriedly opening it, drawing out a pound of raisins, and bribing the attacking party by giving them a plum apiece.  \"Ta ta!  I'm off,\" cried Shadrach, with glistening eyes, as he hurried out and banged the door after him; but only to climb on to the window-sill by means of holding on to the water-butt and nearly pulling it over, when he could peep through a hole in the shutter and see his wife hold up to the eyes of the exultant children the Christmas-box regularly given by Teman, Sundry, and Sope to their _employes_.  There was a pound of raisins, and a pound of currants, and a ditto brown sugar, a ditto lump, an ounce of spice, and a quarter of a pound of peel; which was the last packet opened, when Shadrach leaped down and hurried away through the dirty street.  But it was fine now overhead, and the stars began to twinkle brightly, while the slushy roads were fast growing crisp; but not crisp enough to prevent moisture from creeping through into Shadrach's boots.  \"Because they live on the sand which--law!\" cried Shadrach, \"what a pity we can't live on sand; what a lot the little 'uns do eat.\"  And then he stopped short for a minute to hear some street singers spoiling a carol, and heard the reference to a babe in a manger; and then somehow, as he trotted on, Shadrach could not see very clearly for thinking of two lambs lost from his humble fold: one sleeping in its little grave with the pure white snow covering its breast, and the bright stars like angels' eyes watching it; and the other--\"My poor, poor bairn!\" sobbed the little man, hurrying along; and then he was elbowing his way through the throng on London Bridge, eager to get back in time.  \"That's the worst of music,\" said Shadrach; \"it allus upsets me.  Ah! yah! where are you running to, you young dog?\" he cried to a boy who, yelling out \"I would I were a bird,\" blundered on to the little man's favourite corn, and made him limp the rest of the way.  \"Not that sort of music, confound him.  Would he was a bird, indeed!  Pity he ain't got his neck wrung for him.  Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Shadrach, taking a long breath; \"how bracing the wind is off the river! why, I do declare if I couldn't over posts or anything to-night.\"  But there was no room for Shadrach to run or over posts, for the streets were thronged with busy, hurrying people.  The roadway was crowded too; and everywhere it was plain to see that Christmas was here.  It was quite a blessing that some of the laden railway-vans did not break down, for there would have been an absolute block; while, however it was possible for all the presents on the way to get to their destination in time, no one could say.  Shops and people, ay, and weather too, all spoke of Christmas: people looked hearty and genial; the shops looked generous; while, though the weather felt cold, it was not a griping, nipping cold, but a warm, dry cold that made the slush hard and firm, and whispered of blazing fires and brave old English comforts.  God bless it!  I love a Christmas-night; and, when I say a Christmas-night, I mean any night in that jovial, happy tide, when men sink the care and money-hunting to spread enjoyment around; when the hand is open, either for a loving, brotherly pressure, or to aid a poorer brother; or, better still, the fatherless and the widow.  The hand open? ay, and the heart too; for there seems to be breathed around a spirit that softens the hard crust, so that it is open to any emotion, be it such as begets mirth or tears.  Who can say what it is?--that loving, happy exhilaration that comes over us, and makes a man even kiss his mother-in-law roundly.  Why, it's the very time to get your salary raised, is Christmas; and now the secret is out, I know I shall never be forgiven by the heads of firms, who will be pounds out of pocket in future.  Who ever kicked a dog at Christmas; or prosecuted a thief? who ever gave a beggar a penny without a blush for the smallness of the sum? God bless it! though it comes so soon year after year to tell us how by twelve months our span of life is shorter, and that we are nearer to the long sleep.  God bless it! and may its genial breath softly waft the incense from every frugal hearth in our land, and rest in love where the poor prepare their humble feast--ay, feast; for the simplest Christmas dinner is a feast sprinkled by the torch of \"Christmas Present.\" There's something stirring in the very air, and the bells sound as they do at no other time--they go home to the feelings, and call up from the past the happy emotions planted in our hearts by God; but which a busy life and rude contact with the world have caused to flee away and hide. Back they come though, till, in the wild delight, eyes sparkle, cheeks flush, and hands grasp hands in the fulness of heart to give a squeeze often accompanied by a twinkling eye, where a tear will force its way. Holy--sacred--are those reunions--those family meetings; and sad is it when a seat becomes vacant; but is not that loss a bond to bind those left the tighter, as wishing each other \"a merry Christmas,\" as I do, they say--\"God bless it!\"  Is there such a thing as a kind of magnetism in life by which spirit whispers to spirit, and by some occult warning we know that those we love are near?  Or why should old Shadrach start and shiver as he passed some one in the throng, and then mutter to himself very thoughtfully--\"Poor Polly!\"  But it was a busy night, and what baskets did Shadrach lug about from Gracechurch Street.  East, west, north, and south--here, there, and everywhere.  Light porter, indeed! why, we won't insult him.  But he didn't mind, bless you, though he groaned and grunted under his load of Christmas fruit; and there was something merry to say to every servant lass who lightened his basket.  Toast and ale, and egg-flip too, were waiting when eleven o'clock struck, and though Mr Sope wanted to keep open another hour, and Sundry said half an hour, old Teman, the head, said \"No! regular hours were the thing, and it was not fair to the young men; and that if the Queen herself came from Buckingham Palace and wanted a pound or two of fruit, she should not have it after the shutters were up.\"  It would have done your heart good to have seen Shadrach rattle up those shutters, as the boy down stairs held them up to the roller ready for him to take.  \"Ter-r-r-r-r-rattle\" went the shutter as he dragged it over the roller, and then \"flip-flap-bang,\" it was in its place.  \"Ter-r-r-r-r-rattle\" went another, and nearly knocked an old gentleman over, but he only gave a leap, skip, and a jump, and laughed.  Two shutters up, and that big, nodding Chinese mandarin with the bare stomach is covered up. \"Ter-r-r-r-rattle,\" and part of the big China punchbowl covered. \"Ter-r-r-r-rattle,\" and the whole of it covered.  At it again--and the squeezy almond-eyed lady hidden.  At it again, nine shutters up.  At it again, skipping about as though he had never walked a step that day, but just come fresh out of a lavender-and-clover bed ready for work, after lying by for a rest.  \"Ter-r-r-r-rattle-bing-bang-bump.\"  He did it that time: knocked the policeman's helmet off, and sent it rolling along the pavement.  \"God bless my soul,\" said Shadrach, aghast at such an assault upon the law of the land, but the policeman only laughed, and old Teman only laughed, and called the bobby up to the door, while he fetched him a glass of egg-flip himself, and wished him \"A merry Christmas.\"  \"Bang--slap--slip--flap--crack--jangle--jang--jink jonk--jank!\"  There they are; the twelve shutters up, and both iron bars; screws rammed in, and all tight; and Shadrach not a bit out of breath.  Shop closed, and no Queen to beg for a pound or two of fruit and test old Teman's loyalty, as he ladled out the flip to his dozen men, when, wishing he could have poured his share into his pocket, Shadrach said \"Good-night!\" and was off homeward."]]]
