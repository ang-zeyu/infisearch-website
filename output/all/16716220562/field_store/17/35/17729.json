But the advance guard of progress has 10:21   paid for the privilege of prayer the price of persecution.                                Asking amiss          Experience teaches us that we do not always receive         the blessings we ask for in prayer. There is some mis- 10:24   apprehension of the source and means of         all goodness and blessedness, or we should         certainly receive that for which we ask. The Scrip- 10:27   tures say: \"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask         amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.\" That         which we desire and for which we ask, it is not always 10:30   best for us to receive. In this case infinite Love will         not grant the request. Do you ask wisdom to be mer-         ciful and not to punish sin? Then \"ye ask amiss.\" 11:1    Without punishment, sin would multiply. Jesus' prayer,         \"Forgive us our debts,\" specified also the terms of 11:3    forgiveness. When forgiving the adulterous woman he         said, \"Go, and sin no more.\"                            Remission of penalty          A magistrate sometimes remits the penalty, but this 11:6    may be no moral benefit to the criminal, and at best, it         only saves the criminal from one form of         punishment. The moral law, which has the 11:9    right to acquit or condemn, always demands restitu-         tion before mortals can \"go up higher.\" Broken law         brings penalty in order to compel this progress.                           Truth annihilates error  11:12   Mere legal pardon (and there is no other, for divine         Principle never pardons our sins or mistakes till they         are corrected) leaves the offender free to re- 11:15   peat the offence, if indeed, he has not already         suffered sufficiently from vice to make him turn from it         with loathing. Truth bestows no pardon upon error, but 11:18   wipes it out in the most effectual manner. Jesus suffered         for our sins, not to annul the divine sentence for an in-         dividual's sin, but because sin brings inevitable suffering.                             Desire for holiness  11:21   Petitions bring to mortals only the results of mor-         tals' own faith. We know that a desire for holiness is         requisite in order to gain holiness; but if we 11:24   desire holiness above all else, we shall sac-         rifice everything for it. We must be willing to do this,         that we may walk securely in the only practical road 11:27   to holiness. Prayer cannot change the unalterable         Truth, nor can prayer alone give us an understanding         of Truth; but prayer, coupled with a fervent habitual 11:30   desire to know and do the will of God, will bring us         into all Truth. Such a desire has little need of audible         expression. It is best expressed in thought and in life.                             Prayer for the sick  12:1    \"The prayer of faith shall save the sick,\" says the         Scripture. What is this healing prayer? A mere re- 12:3    quest that God will heal the sick has no         power to gain more of the divine presence         than is always at hand. The beneficial effect of 12:6    such prayer for the sick is on the human mind, mak-         ing it act more powerfully on the body through a blind         faith in God. This, however, is one belief casting out 12:9    another, - a belief in the unknown casting out a belief         in sickness. It is neither Science nor Truth which         acts through blind belief, nor is it the human under- 12:12   standing of the divine healing Principle as manifested         in Jesus, whose humble prayers were deep and con-         scientious protests of Truth, - of man's likeness to 12:15   God and of man's unity with Truth and Love.          Prayer to a corporeal God affects the sick like a         drug, which has no efficacy of its own but borrows its 12:18   power from human faith and belief. The drug does         nothing, because it has no intelligence. It is a mortal         belief, not divine Principle or Love, which causes a 12:21   drug to be apparently either poisonous or sanative.          The common custom of praying for the recovery of the         sick finds help in blind belief, whereas help should come 12:24   from the enlightened understanding. Changes in belief         may go on indefinitely, but they are the merchandise of         human thought and not the outgrowth of divine Science.                        Love impartial and universal  12:27   Does Deity interpose in behalf of one worshipper,         and not help another who offers the same measure of         prayer? If the sick recover because they 12:30   pray or are prayed for audibly, only peti-         tioners (/per se/ or by proxy) should get well. In divine         Science, where prayers are mental, /all/ may avail them- 13:1    selves of God as \"a very present help in trouble.\"         Love is impartial and universal in its adaptation and 13:3    bestowals. It is the open fount which cries, \"Ho,         every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.\"                            Public exaggerations          In public prayer we often go beyond our convictions, 13:6    beyond the honest standpoint of fervent desire. If we         are not secretly yearning and openly striv-         ing for the accomplishment of all we ask, 13:9    our prayers are \"vain repetitions,\" such as the heathen         use. If our petitions are sincere, we labor for what we         ask; and our Father, who seeth in secret, will reward 13:12   us openly. Can the mere public expression of our de-         sires increase them? Do we gain the omnipotent ear         sooner by words than by thoughts? Even if prayer is 13:15   sincere, God knows our need before we tell Him or our         fellow-beings about it. If we cherish the desire hon-         estly and silently and humbly, God will bless it, and 13:18   we shall incur less risk of overwhelming our real         wishes with a torrent of words.                             Corporeal ignorance          If we pray to God as a corporeal person, this will 13:21   prevent us from relinquishing the human doubts and         fears which attend such a belief, and so we         cannot grasp the wonders wrought by infi- 13:24   nite, incorporeal Love, to whom all things are possible.         Because of human ignorance of the divine Principle,         Love, the Father of all is represented as a corporeal 13:27   creator; hence men recognize themselves as merely         physical, and are ignorant of man as God's image or re-         flection and of man's eternal incorporeal existence. The 13:30   world of error is ignorant of the world of Truth, - blind         to the reality of man's existence, - for the world of sen-         sation is not cognizant of life in Soul, not in body.                               Bodily presence  14:1    If we are sensibly with the body and regard omnipo-         tence as a corporeal, material person, whose ear we 14:3    would gain, we are not \"absent from the         body\" and \"present with the Lord\" in the         demonstration of Spirit. We cannot \"serve two mas- 14:6    ters.\" To be \"present with the Lord\" is to have, not         mere emotional ecstasy or faith, but the actual demon-         stration and understanding of Life as revealed in 14:9    Christian Science. To be \"with the Lord\" is to be in         obedience to the law of God, to be absolutely governed         by divine Love,- by Spirit, not by matter.                         Spiritualized consciousness  14:12   Become conscious for a single moment that Life and         intelligence are purely spiritual, - neither in nor of         matter, - and the body will then utter no 14:15   complaints. If suffering from a belief in         sickness, you will find yourself suddenly well. Sorrow         is turned into joy when the body is controlled by spir- 14:18   itual Life, Truth, and Love. Hence the hope of the         promise Jesus bestows: \"He that believeth on me,         the works that I do shall he do also; . . . because I 14:21   go unto my Father,\" - [because the Ego is absent from         the body, and present with Truth and Love.] The         Lord's Prayer is the prayer of Soul, not of material 14:24   sense.          Entirely separate from the belief and dream of mate-         rial living, is the Life divine, revealing spiritual under- 14:27   standing and the consciousness of man's dominion         over the whole earth. This understanding casts out         error and heals the sick, and with it you can speak 14:30   \"as one having authority.\"          \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and,         when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father 15:1    which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in         secret, shall reward thee openly.\"                             Spiritual sanctuary  15:3    So spake Jesus. The closet typifies the sanctuary of         Spirit, the door of which shuts out sinful sense but         lets in Truth, Life, and Love. Closed to 15:6    error, it is open to Truth, and /vice versa/.         The Father in secret is unseen to the physical senses,         but He knows all things and rewards according to 15:9    motives, not according to speech. To enter into the         heart of prayer, the door of the erring senses must be         closed. Lips must be mute and materialism silent, 15:12   that man may have audience with Spirit, the divine         Principle, Love, which destroys all error.                            Effectual invocation          In order to pray aright, we must enter into the 15:15   closet and shut the door. We must close the lips and         silence the material senses. In the quiet         sanctuary of earnest "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],["title","Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#4)"],["body","longings, we must 15:18   deny sin and plead God's allness. We must resolve to         take up the cross, and go forth with honest hearts to         work and watch for wisdom, Truth, and Love. We 15:21   must \"pray without ceasing.\" Such prayer is an-         swered, in so far as we put our desires into practice.         The Master's injunction is, that we pray in secret and 15:24   let our lives attest our sincerity.                           Trustworthy beneficence          Christians rejoice in secret beauty and bounty, hidden         from the world, but known to God. Self-forgetfulness, 15:27   purity, and affection are constant prayers.         Practice not profession, understanding not         belief, gain the ear and right hand of omnipotence and 15:30   they assuredly call down infinite blessings. Trustworthi-         ness is the foundation of enlightened faith. Without a         fitness for holiness, we cannot receive holiness.                             Loftiest adoration  16:1    A great sacrifice of material things must precede this         advanced spiritual understanding. The highest prayer 16:3    is not one of faith merely; it is demonstra-         tion. Such prayer heals sickness, and must         destroy sin and death. It distinguishes between Truth 16:6    that is sinless and the falsity of sinful sense.                         The prayer of Jesus Christ          Our Master taught his disciples one brief prayer,         which we name after him the Lord's Prayer. Our Mas- 16:9    ter said, \"After this manner therefore pray         ye,\" and then he gave that prayer which         covers all human needs. There is indeed some doubt 16:12   among Bible scholars, whether the last line is not an         addition to the prayer by a later copyist; but this does         not affect the meaning of the prayer itself.  16:15   In the phrase, \"Deliver us from evil,\" the original         properly reads, \"Deliver us from the evil one.\" This         reading strengthens our scientific apprehension of the peti- 16:18   tion, for Christian Science teaches us that \"the evil one,\" or         one evil, is but another name for the first lie and all liars.          Only as we rise above all material sensuousness and 16:21   sin, can we reach the heaven-born aspiration and spir-         itual consciousness, which is indicated in the Lord's         Prayer and which instantaneously heals the sick. 16:24   Here let me give what I understand to be the spir-         itual sense of the Lord's Prayer:          Our Father which art in heaven, 16:27      /Our Father-Mother God, all-harmonious/,          Hallowed be Thy name.            /Adorable One./  16:30   Thy kingdom come.            /Thy kingdom is come; Thou art ever-present./  17:1    Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.            /Enable us to know,- as in heaven, so on earth,- God is 17:3          omnipotent, supreme/.          Give us this day our daily bread;            /Give us grace for to-day; feed the famished affections;/  17:6    And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.            /And Love is reflected in love;/          And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from 17:9         evil;            /And God leadeth us not into temptation, but delivereth              us from sin, disease, and death./  17:12   For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the              glory, forever.            /For God is infinite, all-power, all Life, Truth, Love, over              all, and All./             CHAPTER II - ATONEMENT AND EUCHARIST          And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the         affections and lusts. - PAUL.          For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel.         - PAUL.          For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,         until the kingdom of God shall come. - JESUS.                               Divine oneness  18:1    ATONEMENT is the exemplification of man's unity         with God, whereby man reflects divine Truth, Life, 18:3    and Love. Jesus of Nazareth taught and demonstrated         man's oneness with the Father, and for this we owe him         endless homage. His mission was both in- 18:6    dividual and collective. He did life's work         aright not only in justice to himself, but in mercy to         mortals,- to show them how to do theirs, but not to do 18:9    it for them nor to relieve them of a single responsibility.         Jesus acted boldly, against the accredited evidence of the         senses, against Pharisaical creeds and practices, and he 18:12   refuted all opponents with his healing power.                            Human reconciliation          The atonement of Christ reconciles man to God, not         God to man; for the divine Principle of Christ is God, 18:15   and how can God propitiate Himself? Christ         is Truth, which reaches no higher than itself.         The fountain can rise no higher than its source. Christ, 18:18   Truth, could conciliate no nature above his own, derived 19:1    from the eternal Love. It was therefore Christ's purpose         to reconcile man to God, not God to man. Love and 19:3    Truth are not at war with God's image and likeness.         Man cannot exceed divine Love, and so atone for him-         self. Even Christ cannot reconcile Truth to error, for 19:6    Truth and error are irreconcilable. Jesus aided in recon-         ciling man to God by giving man a truer sense of Love,         the divine Principle of Jesus' teachings, and this truer 19:9    sense of Love redeems man from the law of matter,         sin, and death by the law of Spirit,- the law of divine         Love.  19:12   The Master forbore not to speak the whole truth, de-         claring precisely what would destroy sickness, sin, and         death, although his teaching set households at variance, 19:15   and brought to material beliefs not peace, but a         sword.                           Efficacious repentance          Every pang of repentance and suffering, every effort 19:18   for reform, every good thought and deed, will help us to         understand Jesus' atonement for sin and aid         its efficacy; but if the sinner continues to pray 19:21   and repent, sin and be sorry, he has little part in the atone-         ment,- in the /at-one-ment/ with God,- for he lacks the         practical repentance, which reforms the heart and enables 19:24   man to do the will of wisdom. Those who cannot dem-         onstrate, at least in part, the divine Principle of the teach-         ings and practice of our Master have no part in God. If 19:27   living in disobedience to Him, we ought to feel no secur-         ity, although God is good.                            Jesus' sinless career          Jesus urged the commandment, \"Thou shalt have no 19:30   other gods before me,\" which may be ren-         dered: Thou shalt have no belief of Life as         mortal; thou shalt not know evil, for there is one Life,- 20:1    even God, good. He rendered \"unto Caesar the things         which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are 20:3    God's.\" He at last paid no homage to forms of doctrine         or to theories of man, but acted and spake as he was moved,         not by spirits but by Spirit.  20:6    To the ritualistic priest and hypocritical Pharisee         Jesus said, \"The publicans and the harlots go into the         kingdom of God before you.\" Jesus' history made a 20:9    new calendar, which we call the Christian era; but he         established no ritualistic worship. He knew that men         can be baptized, partake of the Eucharist, support the 20:12   clergy, observe the Sabbath, make long prayers, and yet         be sensual and sinful.                               Perfect example          Jesus bore our infirmities; he knew the error of mortal 20:15   belief, and \"with his stripes [the rejection of error] we are         healed.\" \"Despised and rejected of men,\"         returning blessing for cursing, he taught mor- 20:18   tals the opposite of themselves, even the nature of God;         and when error felt the power of Truth, the scourge and         the cross awaited the great Teacher. Yet he swerved not, 20:21   well knowing that to obey the divine order and trust God,         saves retracing and traversing anew the path from sin to         holiness.                             Behest of the cross  20:24   Material belief is slow to acknowledge what the         spiritual fact implies. The truth is the centre of all         religion. It commands sure entrance into 20:27   the realm of Love. St. Paul wrote, \"Let us         lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so         easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that 20:30   is set before us;\" that is, let us put aside material self         and sense, and seek the divine Principle and Science of         all healing.                                Moral victory  21:1    If Truth is overcoming error in your daily walk and         conversation, you can finally say, \"I have fought a 21:3    good fight . . . I have kept the faith,\" be-         cause you are a better man. This is having         our part in the at-one-ment with Truth and Love. 21:6    Christians do not continue to labor and pray, expecting         because of another's goodness, suffering, and triumph,         that they shall reach his harmony and reward.  21:9    If the disciple is advancing spiritually, he is striv-         ing to enter in. He constantly turns away from ma-         terial sense, and looks towards the imperishable things 21:12   of Spirit. If honest, he will be in earnest from the         start, and gain a little each day in the right direction,         till at last he finishes his course with joy.                           Inharmonious travellers  21:15   If my friends are going to Europe, while I am /en         route/ for California, we are not journeying together.  "]]]
