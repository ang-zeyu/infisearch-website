Dowitchers having noticeably short bills should be collected when possible.      Subspecies in Kansas: _L. g. hendersoni_ Rowan.   _Limnodromus scolopaceus_ (Say). Long-billed Dowitcher. Common transient throughout state.      No subspecies recognized.   _Micropalama himantopus_ (Bonaparte). Stilt Sandpiper. Common transient throughout state.      No subspecies recognized.   _Ereunetes pusillus_ (Linnaeus). Semipalmated Sandpiper. Common transient throughout state.      No subspecies recognized.   _Ereunetes mauri_ Cabanis. Western Sandpiper.
