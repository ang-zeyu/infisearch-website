Here he wrote sacred music and his first operas.  In his twenty-second year Handel went to Italy, where he stayed for three years. Here he met and became very friendly with Corelli and the two Scarlattis.                            [Illustration: No. 7                               A.

SCARLATTI.]  After his residence in Italy Handel went back to Germany, where he met the Elector of Hanover, who induced him to accept the post of Capellmeister. Handel agreed to do this on condition that he might first visit England.  When Handel reached England he found himself already well known there. The English people knew his operas, and liked them so much that Handel concluded to stay.  But to his surprise and confusion it happened while he was in London that the very Elector of Hanover became George I, King of England. Handel expected he would fare badly with the king for not having returned as Capellmeister to Germany. But a friend arranged the matter so that Handel should compose some music for the king's coronation, hoping thereby to please his majesty.  He composed twenty-five pieces, called _Water Music_. A boat containing the players followed that in which the king sat. When the music was performed the king asked who composed it. This led to Handel's being invited into the royal boat, where he again won the king's favor.                           [Illustration: No. 10                              WATER MUSIC.]  Handel greatly wished to give opera in London and devote his time to it as composer. For many years the writing and staging of operas took all of Handel's time and thought, but he was not destined to make it a true success. Handel was a very fine performer at the keyboard.                           [Illustration: No. 11                         HANDEL AT THE KEYBOARD.]  Once again Handel visited his native land. On returning to England, which was to be his home for the future, he was asked by a wealthy gentleman, the Duke of Chandos, to become composer at the ducal residence. Handel accepted this offer and composed much beautiful music, which some day we shall hear.  Handel was much beloved in England and was received at court.                           [Illustration: No. 12            HANDEL IN THE DRESS HE WORE AT THE ENGLISH COURT.]  He had tried hard to please the English public as an opera composer, and the disappointment of his failure caused him a severe illness from which he suffered greatly. He lived to write some of the most lovely music the world possesses.  Perhaps the most famous of all his oratorios is the _Messiah_. When this was sung for the first time in London the king and all present rose at the words--_For the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth_. Thus came the custom of rising at the singing of the _Hallelujah Chorus_.  Handel loved England and became a naturalized British subject. He had a house in London, which in those days must have been considered a very fine one. He was very fond of gathering bodies of musicians together. Here he is in a familiar group.                           [Illustration: No. 13                 HANDEL IN THE CIRCLE OF HIS MUSICIANS.]  A great lover of children, Handel once conducted the _Messiah_ for the benefit of a hospital for little children, to which he gave large sums.  Toward the end of his life he became blind. Some one had to lead him to the organ loft, where, with his wonderful skill, he could still charm and delight.  The last appearance that Handel made in public was to conduct the _Messiah_. A few days later, on Good Friday, April 13, 1759, he passed away.                            [Illustration: No. 14                  BLIND HANDEL BEING LED TO THE ORGAN.]  The English people loved and admired him so much that he was buried in Westminster Abbey.

THEO. PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.                               HOW TO USE THIS BOOK   This book is one of a series known as THE CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF THE GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\" \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.  The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.  After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous pages.  The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's own book.  This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth while.                     *       *       *       *       *  This series of The Child's Own Book of the Great Musicians includes at present a book on each of the following:              Bach                                 Mendelssohn             Beethoven                            Mozart             Chopin                               Schubert             Grieg                                Schumann             Handel                               Verdi             Haydn                                Wagner             Liszt                           Printed in the U.S.A.

DIED                      ..................................                                  Giuseppe Verdi   The picture on this page is of the house wherein a great composer was born. Of course, one is not born a great composer. He has to become that. So, at the moment this story begins there is, within this house, a little boy quite like any other boy. He loved to play and to make a noise and to have a good time. But most of all--what do you think he loved?  A hand organ.                            [Illustration: No. 2                           VERDI'S BIRTHPLACE]  Whenever the organ man came into the village of Roncole, in Italy (where Verdi was born, October 10, 1813), he could not be kept indoors. But he followed the wonderful organ and the wonderful man who played it, all day long, as happy as he could be.  When Giuseppe was seven years old his father, though only a poor innkeeper, bought him a spinet, a sort of small piano. So faithfully did the little boy practise that the spinet was soon quite worn out and new jacks, or hammers, had to be made for it. This was done by Stephen Cavaletti, who wrote a message on one of the jacks telling that he made them anew and covered them with leather, and fixed the pedal, doing all for nothing, because the little boy, Giuseppe Verdi, showed such willingness to practise and to learn. Thus the good Stephen thought this was pay enough.  Here is a picture of the little piano. In Verdi's language (Italian) it is called a spinetta.                            [Illustration: No. 3                           VERDI'S SPINET]  It was on this spinet that the little boy discovered one day a wonderful chord, for so it seemed to him. It was this:                           [Illustration: No. 4]  The tones delighted him and he pressed the keys over and over again to drink them in. But the next day when he sought again the keys which made the lovely sound, he could not find them. This made him so impatient and finally so curious that he began to break the spinet to pieces with a hammer. Fortunately the noise he made brought his father into the room and the spinet was saved.  When Giuseppe was making his first attempt to find beautiful chords on the spinet he was, as we have said, seven years old. That was in 1820.  When he was ten years old (what year was that?) Giuseppe became organist at the old church of Roncole. Truly a little boy for so great a position! One day he scratched his name on the woodwork. Here is a picture of the organ:                            [Illustration: No. 5                           ORGAN AT RONCOLE]  Here is the scratching of his name:                           [Illustration: No. 6]  And here is the way he wrote his name, as a man:                           [Illustration: No. 7]  Then there came the question of education--of reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic--for this music-loving boy. The Verdis wanted Giuseppe to grow up as he should; so it was arranged for him to go to school in the neighboring town of Busseto. A cobbler lived there who was a friend of the family, and with him Giuseppe went to live, having board, lodging and tuition at the school, and all for six cents a day.  Giuseppe still played the organ at Roncole, going thither afoot every Sunday morning and back after nightfall.  He must have been a weary little boy after the day's music-making at the church. One Sunday night when it was dark and he was too weary to notice where he was going, he fell into a ditch, from which he was rescued by an old woman, who, hearing his call for help, pulled the half-frozen boy out of the water.  Our little hero had another talent besides music. He knew how to win the friendship of people. So at Busseto a man named Barezzi offered to take him into his business. He sold spices, drugs and perfumes. But besides this he played the flute in the church. At his house Giuseppe heard lots of good music, for the town orchestra rehearsed there. Here is a picture of Giuseppe's friend:                           [Illustration: No. 8                          BAREZZI]  Then Giuseppe made another friend who gave him a wonderful bit of advice. HE URGED HIM TO BECOME A COMPOSER!  Better still he helped the boy in every way he could until he was sixteen years old. By that time our little Giuseppe was grown to be quite a man. His friend, whose name was Ferdinando Provesi, was proud of him, for already he was becoming a master. He played the cathedral organ at times; he conducted the Philharmonic Orchestra; he led its rehearsals, and he composed music for its concerts.                           [Illustration: No. 9                          PROVESI]  So you see--all the wonderful operas that were to come were already on the way!  It has been written that Provesi was the first person to see and understand Verdi's real genius. The boy worked hard and advanced so rapidly that it was soon necessary for him to go to a larger city for lessons.  Now a good friend is always a good friend, so it is pleasing to tell that Barezzi sent Giuseppe to Milan, the lovely city of Lombardy, to study. And here a curious thing happened. He was refused a scholarship at the Conservatory of Milan; the reason given was that the authorities considered him to show no special talent for music. But this made no difference to the boy. He believed in his talent and"]]]
