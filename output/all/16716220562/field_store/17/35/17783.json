According to John xii. 41, Isaiah saw the glory of Christ and spake of him; on the other hand, in the passage referred to, chap. vi., Isaiah saw the glory of Jehovah. 1 Cor. x. 9, it is said, 'Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents.' According to this passage, therefore, Christ was the leader of the Israelites through the wilderness, and was tempted by them. On the other hand, the Pentateuch relates that they were led by the Angel Jehovah; and in Numb. xxi. 5-7, that they tempted Jehovah. 1 Pet. i. 10 declares that the Spirit of Christ spake by the prophets: but the prophets themselves always refer to Jehovah as the source of their predictions. According to Heb. xi. 26, Moses preferred reproach for the sake of Christ, to the treasures of Egypt: the narrative in Exodus informs us that he sacrificed every thing to the service of Jehovah. According to Heb. xii. 26, at the giving of the law, the voice of Christ shook the earth: in Exodus this was done by Jehovah.\" \"We must in a certain respect distinguish between the Angel Jehovah and the Son of God, and not, with the Fathers and most of the old theologians, venture to say that they are perfectly identical.\" \"That the Mediator of the New Testament was also, as the Angel Jehovah, the Mediator in all the relations of God to the people of the Old Testament, was, with the exception of the above named Fathers, the unanimous opinion of the ancient Church.\"  After quoting a list of authorities, he concludes: \"Let us now briefly sum up the result of the preceding investigation. In the prophetic Scriptures, a divine as well as human nature is attributed to the Messiah; and yet every polytheistic idea is excluded by the assumption of his essential unity with the Most High God. It was expected that the Angel or Revealer of Jehovah, who had often before made himself occasionally visible, and acted as the Mediator between God and the people, in all their transactions, would assume human nature in the person of the Messiah, and redeem and bless both Jews and Gentiles.  \"Here the question yet arises: If the distinction between the revealed and the unrevealed God was already made known under the Old Testament, wherein is the New Testament in this respect superior to the Old? The preference consists in this: Under the Old Testament the distinction was necessarily kept more out of view, and hence might easily appear to be founded not so much on a relation in the Godhead itself, as on a relation to those to whom the revelation was made. In the Old Testament, the Mediator commonly spoke and acted in the name of God, whom he revealed. Nor could it be otherwise before the Logos had become flesh. Hence the Revealer and He who was revealed in a manner lost themselves in each other. But under the New Testament, on the contrary, they appeared distinguished from each other, as Father and Son. Religion thus gained a two-fold advantage. It became more spiritual, and at the same time more an object of sense: more spiritual, by the exclusion of those limited conceptions of the spirituality, the omniscience, and the omnipresence of God which arose from confounding the Revealer with him who was revealed; more an object of sense, because the Son of God, in his life, sufferings, and death, brought the Divine Being nearer to man than was possible in the transient appearances of the Angel under the Old Testament. But such a condescension of the Deity to fallen man is indispensable to his becoming like God.\"  On these passages it may be observed, that in what the author says of the Mediator having \"constantly filled up the infinite distance between the Creator and the creation,\" he proceeds on the common theory that the invisible, the concealed God, in distinction from the personal Word, is the Creator. This is inconsistent with the preceding statement, that he never manifests himself in a sensible form: for He who created, upholds and governs, appeared personally and visibly to Abraham, Jacob, Moses and others, as Jehovah, gave the law at Sinai, and was the leader of Israel. With respect to the distinction which he refers to as existing in a certain respect between the Angel of Jehovah and the Son of God, it is presumed that he considered the latter title as applicable to the second Person of the Trinity, eternally, and as designating that Person anterior to his appointment as Mediator, and without reference to his incarnation or his official work in any respect. The doctrine which he ascribes to the Fathers is presumed to be, that the official Person who is called the Angel Jehovah, and who took on him the seed of Abraham, was identically the same Person before and after the accession and union of man's nature to the Divine; and that he was designated as the same person by the phrase, \"the Son of God.\" In the passages above quoted, where the preposition _of_ is not inserted between the words Angel and Jehovah, the author gives the Hebrew words. When he translates them, he inserts the preposition.     CHAPTER VI.      Appearances of the Messenger Jehovah to Abraham and to Jacob.   In the narrative of Abraham's offering of Isaac, Gen. xxii., we read that \"Melach Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, for _I_ know that thou fearest Elohim, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from _me_. And Melach Jehovah called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, That in blessing I will bless thee, because thou hast obeyed _my voice_.\"  At the commencement of this narrative it is said that (_the_) Elohim did tempt Abraham, _i. e._, try him in respect to his faith and obedience. \"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. And Abraham went unto the place of which (_the_) Elohim had told him.\" There he built an altar, and having bound Isaac he laid him on the altar, and took the knife to slay him; when Melach Jehovah called to him, forbade the intended sacrifice, and said, I know that thou fearest Elohim, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son from _me_. From this it is evident that the offering was intended to be made, and was virtually made, to Melach Jehovah. For \"By faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac; accounting that God was able to raise him up from the dead, from whence also he received him in a figure.\" Heb. xi. His faith, in this extraordinary act of worship, had immediate respect to the delegated Messenger Jehovah, then and ever the resurrection and the life. He was the Divine speaker on the occasion, his voice it was that Abraham obeyed, and to him he rendered the highest acts of homage and obedience. It was in his official name, as well as in that of Elohim, that he spoke to Abraham, and to him in all respects the scene evidently refers. After offering the animal provided in place of Isaac, he discerned an import and a reference in the transaction, which were to be fulfilled on the same mount at a future day; and he therefore named the place Jehovah-Jireh, importing that what was signified by his offering would be realized and witnessed there, and giving rise to a saying expressive of that result, and pointing no doubt, so explicitly as not to be misunderstood, to the sacrifice of Christ: namely, \"In the mount of Jehovah it shall be seen;\" or, according to Warburton, Book vi. sec. 5, \"In the mount Jehovah shall be seen.\"  In the narrative of Jacob's departure from Laban, Gen. xxi., he says: \"Melach (the) Elohim spake unto me in a dream, and he said, I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. I am the El of Beth-El, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto _me_.\" Here the Messenger Jehovah declares himself to be the God of Beth-El, and that the vow made there was made to him. In chap. xxviii., where that transaction is related, he is announced, not by this special name of office, but by other designations, showing that in his official character he was familiarly recognized by the various Divine names, whether employed separately or conjointly. And Jacob awaked and said, \"Surely Jehovah is in this place; this is the house of Elohim: and Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If Elohim will be with me, &c., then shall Jehovah be my Elohe.\"  There is in the history of Jacob another striking illustration of this usage. On his way from Padan-aram, after his interview with Esau, he came to Shalem in the land of Canaan and pitched his tent there, and built an altar which he called El-Elohe-Israel. Subsequently Elohim said unto Jacob, \"Arise, go up to Beth-El, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto El that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. Then Jacob said unto his household, Let us arise and go up to Beth-El, and I will make there an altar unto El who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. So Jacob come to Beth-El, and he built there an altar, and called the place El-Beth-El, because there (the) Elohim appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. And Elohim appeared unto Jacob again; and Elohim said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Isra-El shall be thy name. And Elohim said unto him, I am El-Shadai, (God Almighty.) And Elohim went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\" Chap. xxxv. But He who visibly appeared to, and wrestled with him on the occasion referred to, Gen."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34680"],["title","The Messiah in Moses and the Prophets (#8)"],["body","ii., and whom he saw face to face, was Elohim in the likeness of man, and is called by Hosea Melach, the Messenger, even Jehovah Elohe of Zebaoth.  The above-mentioned appearance of Elohim to Jacob was doubtless a visible appearance, for after talking with Jacob, Elohim went up from him and from the place of meeting. And it is clear that the same Person who before was called a man is here called Elohim. Probably in other instances, where Jehovah or Elohim is said to appear, as to Isaac, Gen. xxvi. 2, 24, and to Abraham and others on various occasions, were visible personal appearances.  Another instance in the history of Jacob, in which the official designation Melach occurs interchangeably with Elohim, is Gen. xlviii. 15: \"And he blessed Joseph and said, (The) Elohim, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, (the) Elohim which fed me all my life long unto this day, _the Melach_ which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads.\" The identity of Person here is made emphatic by the article prefixed to each designation.     CHAPTER VII.      References to various Appearances of Jehovah and Elohim to the     Patriarchs.   It is evident from the preceding illustrations that during the patriarchal dispensation, the personal Word, Jehovah in the delegated character of Messiah, appeared visibly in the form of man, and was recognized under official and other Divine designations, appropriated separately and interchangeably to the one manifested and acting interposer and agent in the works of creation, providence and redemption. There are in the records of that dispensation numerous collateral evidences and implications to the same effect, which may be comprised under what relates to personal designations and appearances, the import and reference of sacrificial offerings, the places, manner, and immediate object of worship, prayer, faith and trust, and the familiarity of intercourse on the part of the Divine administrator of Providence and guardian of his people during that economy.  As a further evidence that the instances in which it is said that Elohim or Jehovah _appeared_ to Abraham or others were local, personal, visible appearances, it may be observed that on the occasion mentioned, Gen. xvii., it is said that Jehovah _appeared_ to him: \"And he left off talking with him, and Elohim _went up_ from Abraham;\" as in a passage before referred to, chap. xxxv., that \"Elohim appeared unto Jacob; and Elohim _went up_ from him in the place where he talked with him.\" The word translated _went up_, signifies to _ascend_, _to go up_, &c., and is of frequent occurrence. Thus, Ps. lxviii. 18: \"Thou hast _ascended_ up on high, thou hast led captivity,\" &c.; quoted and applied to Christ, Eph. iv. Judges xiii. 20: \"When the flame _went up_ towards heaven from off the altar, Melach Jehovah _ascended_ in the flame of the altar.\" Ezekiel xi. 23: \"And the glory of Jehovah _went up_ from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain.\" Gen. xix. 28: \"The smoke of the country _went up_, as the smoke of a furnace.\"  The like evidence as to the local, personal presence of Jehovah on such occasions, results from the use of the word translated _came down_, _descended_, where his presence or the local exercise of his prerogatives is mentioned. Thus, with reference to Babel and the dispersion: \"Jehovah _came down_ to see the city and the tower.... So Jehovah scattered them abroad,\" &c. Gen. xi. 5. So on the occasion of his first visible appearance to Moses: \"Melach Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon Elohim. And Jehovah said, I am _come down_ to deliver them,\" &c. Exod. iii. Again: \"Jehovah _came down_ upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount; and Jehovah called Moses up to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.\" Exod. xix. 20. And when Moses took the two tables of stone up to the top of Sinai, \"Jehovah _descended_ in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.\" Exod. xxxv. At the consecration of the seventy elders, \"Jehovah _came down_ in a cloud, and spake unto Moses.\" Numbers xi. 25. At the sedition of Miriam and Aaron, \"Jehovah _came down_ in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and said, Hear now my words.\" Ibid. xii. 5. These and various other passages clearly import a personal descent in a visible form; and no less clearly indicate, by the titles, occasions and acts narrated, that it was the delegated One, the Word, to whom all such manifestations refer, conformably to the allusion to the ascension of Christ, Ephes. iv.: \"He that _descended_ is the same also that _ascended_ up far above all heavens.\"  The word translated _appeared_, in all the instances of local personal manifestation, literally means _appeared visibly_, _was seen_; as Gen. i. 9: \"Let the dry land _appear_;\" Gen. viii. 5: \"The tops of the mountains _were seen_;\" and vii. 1: \"Thee have I _seen_ righteous;\" ix. 14: \"The bow _shall be seen_;\" xxxi. 42: \"Elohim hath seen mine affliction;\" xlviii. 3: \"El-Shadai _appeared unto me_ at Luz;\" literally, _was seen by me_. Judges xiii. 22: \"We _have seen_ Elohim.\" Exod. xxiv. 10: \"And they saw the Elohe of Israel.\"  This will be further illustrated by reference to particular instances mentioned in the book of Genesis. \"And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah who appeared unto him.\" Chap. lxii. 7. That this was a visible manifestation, is indicated not only by the obvious import of the terms employed, but by Abram's building an altar, and consecrating the locality as a place of worship, and of typical offerings to Jehovah.  Again, chap. xvii. 1: \"Jehovah _appeared_ to Abram, and said unto him, I am El-Shadai; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And Abram fell on his face; and Elohim talked with him, saying,\" &c. After changing his name to Abraham, and that of his wife to Sarah, announcing a covenant with him, hearing his prayer for Ishmael, and giving sundry promises and directions, \"Elohim left off talking with him, and _went up_ from Abraham.\" The language, and all the circumstances and details of this interview, imply a local, personal, visible presence of Jehovah.  The next instance, chap. xviii., is that in which \"Jehovah _appeared_ to Abraham in the plains of Mamre,\" in the likeness of man; was entertained by him, walked and conversed with, and heard his requests in behalf of the righteous in Sodom: which undoubtedly was a local, visible, personal appearance of Jehovah the Word.  In the 26th chapter we read that Isaac went to Gerar, \"And Jehovah _appeared_ unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt,\" &c. Afterwards he removed to Beersheba, \"And Jehovah _appeared_ unto him, and said, I am the Elohe of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,\" &c. \"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there.\" At these interviews the same promises substantially respecting his descendants were made to him, that had been made to Abraham, with the same introductory formula concerning the appearance of the Divine speaker; and considering that Isaac built an altar and fixed his residence at Beersheba, worshipped, doubtless presenting typical offerings on the altar, and consecrating that as the place of his future worship in the confidence of its being thereafter a place of Divine manifestation, there seems to be very ample ground to conclude that these were local, personal, and visible appearances, similar in their form, as they were in their object, to those vouchsafed to Abraham.  The first instance to be noticed in the history of Jacob, is referred to in chap. xlviii. 3: \"And Jacob said unto Joseph, El-Shadai _appeared_ unto me at Luz, and blessed me,\" &c. The occasion was that of his vision of a ladder: \"And Jehovah stood above it and said, I am Jehovah Elohe of Abraham;\" see chap. xxviii. Subsequently, chap. xxxv., he was directed to return and reside at that place. \"Elohim said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and make there an altar unto El, that _appeared_ unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-Beth-El; because there (the) Elohim _appeared_ unto him, when he fled,\" &c. The repetition of the word _appeared_ in these passages, its implied significance as a reason for building an altar, the occasion referred to, and the object of speaking of it to Joseph, indicate a memorable personal, visible appearance at the place specified.  \"And Elohim _appeared_ unto Jacob again, and said unto him, I am El-Shadai; and Elohim _went up_ from him in the place where he talked with him,\" chap. 35: which can hardly be taken for any other than a local and visible presence.     CHAPTER VIII.      Of the Doctrines, Worship, and Faith of those earliest mentioned     in Scripture--Reference to the History of Moses, Noah, Joshua.   Waiving for the present a notice of many analogous instances in other parts of Scripture, it may be observed that there are, in the history of the patriarchs, a variety of statements and expressions which, from the occasions to which they relate, the connections in which they occur, or the things specified, naturally imply the local personal presence of the Divine speaker, especially when considered in connection with the instances in which it is clearly shown that he was visibly present. In the course of that history there are numerous intimations that the worshippers of Jehovah had places appropriated to their religious services, where they offered prayers and sacrifices, and where, by an audible voice, he held immediate and familiar converse with them. Thus in the first recorded instance of worship, Gen. iv., we read that Cain, and Abel also, \"brought an offering unto Jehovah. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and his offering he had "]]]
