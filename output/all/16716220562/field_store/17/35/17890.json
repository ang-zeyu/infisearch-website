Boulenger (1882:86, 381) went so far as to credit Schlegel as the author of the name _japonica_. The reason for this action is not known because Schlegel (in von Siebold, 1838:112) referred to this hylid only under the name \"Hyla arborea.\"   =Rana rugosa= Schlegel      _Rana rugosa_ Schlegel, Reptilia [Saurii et Batrachii], _in_ von       Siebold, Fauna Japonica, p. 110, pl. 3, figs. 3-4, 1838 (type       locality designated as Japan, probably near Nagasaki, by       Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 58:123, July 22, 1907).      _Specimens examined_ (26).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 13 (KU), 1 (UMMZ); 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, 4 (KU); 2 mi. E     Hoengsong, 3 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU);     6 mi. E Seoul, 3 (UMMZ).  _Remarks._--_Rana rugosa_ was associated with _Rana nigromaculata_ and _Rana amurensis coreana_ at all localities where the species was taken save at 2 mi. E Hoengsong, where _R. a. coreana_ was not observed. Three specimens of _R. rugosa_ were collected among grasses and reeds in water along the edge of Ch´orwon Reservoir, 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, where they were difficult to find in the thick vegetation even though their low, soft calls were heard; the specimen from 1 mi. NW Oho-ri was found in a rice field. Otherwise, habitats recorded indicate a preference for small, fast-flowing streams, especially in wooded valleys. On one occasion, individuals were found trapped in cement-walled pits about old ruins on a wooded hillside in the Central National Forest. The earliest and latest dates of capture among our specimens are May 15 and November 6. In addition to the localities listed above, the species was observed 4 mi. W Ch´ungju.  _R. rugosa_ may have an extensive breeding season as suggested by the variation in size of frogs collected or observed in 1954. Of nine frogs obtained on May 29, five ranged in snout-vent length from 26 to 28, and four from 42 to 54. Three specimens collected on October 9 measured 39, 41, and 55, and two obtained on November 6 measured 25 and 37.   =Rana nigromaculata= Hallowell      _Rana nigromaculata_ Hallowell, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,       [12]:500 (for 1860), 1861 (type locality, Simoda, Japan).      _Specimens examined_ (47).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 6 (KU); 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, 5 (KU); 4 mi. W Ch´ungju, 2     (KU); 7 mi. W Ch´ungju, 1 (KU); 2 mi. E Hoengsong, 1 (KU); 8 mi. SW     Kunsan, 1 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 5 (KU); 5 mi. ENE Pusan, 2 (KU); 5     mi. ESE Seoul, 9 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3 (KU), 10 (UMMZ); 6 mi. NNE     Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 2 (KU).      _Description._--Back brownish or grayish (greenish in life), having     few, indistinct or well-defined, dark blotches, or extensive     blackish areas (representing fusion of markings); pale, middorsal     stripe (pale green, buff or yellowish in life) from snout to anus,     sometimes as wide as interorbital width, but indistinct or lacking     when pattern on back absent; blackish bar often present behind     tympanum; posterior surface of thigh mottled; underparts pale yellow     to whitish, sometimes having a few dusky marks on throat;     longitudinal ridges between dorsolateral folds indistinct in some     small frogs; largest female and male having respective snout-vent     lengths of 100 and 70.  _Remarks._--_Rana nigromaculata_ is the most abundant ranid in central Korea and, in a general way, the ecological equivalent of _Rana pipiens_ in temperate North America. The species is associated with most aquatic habitats, from rocky streams to rice fields and large impoundments. In the vicinity of Seoul the din of large breeding congresses was heard more or less continuously from mid-April to mid-May. Large numbers of juveniles (approximately one inch long) were noticed first on July 8 and were present thereafter for about three weeks, being commonest in standing water after heavy rains or during prolonged showers. These data and the different sizes of individuals collected at the same time suggest either variable growth or, more probably, an extensive breeding season. Our earliest and latest dates of collection are April 16 and October 7. The Korean name for \"frog,\" most often applied to _R. nigromaculata_, sounds something like \"keg-oh-ree.\" The call is a prolonged, raspy, staccato croak, sometimes with a rising inflection at the end.  In addition to the localities listed above, the species was observed 5 mi. W Kwangju and 3 mi. S Osan.  Despite a high degree of individual variation, _Rana nigromaculata_ seemingly varies geographically as well; some subspecies probably should be recognized, but the species as a whole has never been thoroughly studied systematically. The division of _R. nigromaculata_ into three subspecies by Schmidt (1927:563-567) was considered untenable by Fang and Chang (1931:95-98), and it has been regarded by most recent authors as a variable, monotypic species.  The named subspecies _R. n. chosenica_ (Okada, 1931:89, with type locality at Seoul, and geographically restricted to Korea) was considered a subspecies of _Rana plancyi_ by Shannon (1956:36). The most trenchant characters of _plancyi_ seem to be the wide dorsolateral folds, the uniform greenish dorsum, the presence of dermal pustules on the back between the dorsolateral folds, and the lack of a mottled pattern on the posterior surface of the thigh. Among our specimens of _R. nigromaculata_, the width of the dorsolateral folds is variable, a uniform greenish dorsum is found only in large males, dermal pustules are mixed with ridges in only one male (KU 38733), and all have a spotted or mottled pattern on the posterior surface of the thigh. All of our specimens having an indistinct pattern on the back, or lacking a pattern, are males and resemble the photographs of males published by Moriya (1954: pl. I, fig. 5) and Liu (1936: pl. IV, figs. 1-2); juveniles of both sexes and large females have contrasting patterns.  None of our frogs seems, therefore, clearly referable to the species _plancyi_, although some characters are suggestive of _plancyi_. Moriya (_op. cit.:19_), who studied variation of _R. nigromaculata_ in Japan, noted that one of the most distinct populations there (_R. n. brevipoda_) resembled _Rana plancyi_. Ting (1939) discovered that _nigromaculata_ and _plancyi_ were cross-fertile and raised hybrid larvae through metamorphosis. Pope and Boring (1940) suggested hybridization between the two species in eastern China, and the above mentioned facts suggest to us the possibility of hybridization in other regions.   =Rana amurensis coreana= Okada      _Rana temporaria coreana_ Okada, Annot. Zool. Japon., 11:140       (footnote), July 25, 1927, _nomen nudum_.      _Rana temporaria coreana_ Okada, Jour. Chosen Nat. Hist. Soc, 6:19,       pl. 1, fig. 7, 1928 (type locality, Keijo [= Seoul], Korea).      _Rana amurensis coreana_, Shannon, Herpetologica, 12:38, March 6,       1956.      _Specimens examined_ (9).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 1 (KU); 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, 1 (KU); 4 mi. W Ch´ungju, 1     (KU); 1 mi. N Oho-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 3 (KU); Yongp´yong, 2     (KU).  _Remarks._--One individual of _R. a. coreana_ (KU 38698) and one of _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ (KU 38715) were collected on May 29 along a stream in the Central National Forest in association with _R. rugosa_ and _R. nigromaculata_. Specimens of _coreana_ from the vicinity of Seoul were found in rice fields. The earliest date of collection was April 13 at Yongp´yong. Our largest specimen of _coreana_ measured 47 in snout-vent length.  Because _R. a. coreana_ and _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ are sympatric in central Korea and closely resemble one another, the two species were not distinguished in the field and the following observations may pertain to either (or both) species. Wood frogs were observed 2 mi. E Songdong-ni on July 12 in paddies (rice fields) along with individuals of _Hyla arborea_, _Rana rugosa_, and _Rana nigromaculata_. At Chip´o-ri on April 6, individuals (probably _R. t. dybowskii_) were seen in a seepage pool from an abandoned rice field; _R. nigromaculata_ also was seen there. Six or seven egg masses (some having small tadpoles) were observed in the shallow water, but it was not certain to which species the eggs belonged. Completely metamorphosed young (probably _R. a. coreana_) were first seen 1 mi. N Oho-ri on June 9. At Taehoesan-ni on November 12, several sluggish frogs were seen in a small pool that was covered by a thin layer of ice.  On September 26 in the Central National Forest, many wood frogs of various sizes were observed. _R. amurensis_ and _R. temporaria_ probably have extended breeding seasons that correspond to those of _R. rugosa_ and _R. nigromaculata_. Judging from our observations, _amurensis_ prefers the proximity of water, whereas _temporaria_ may occur some distance from permanent water.  In our specimens, _R. amurensis coreana_ differs from _R. temporaria dybowskii_ in having (1) smaller maximal size, (2) more slender body, (3) shorter legs, (4) incompletely webbed toes, (5) no mottling or barring on lips, (6) no contrasting barred pattern on hind legs, (7) dark brown stripes (usually) between dorsolateral folds, (8) a dark brown, linear mark below canthus, and (9) an immaculate ventral surface. Two additional distinguishing characters, which we found difficult to evaluate, are the nearly straight, dorsolateral folds, and lack of vocal sacs or ostia in males of _R. a. coreana_ (Shannon, 1956:38). Some of the differences between the two species were illustrated by Okada, 1931:107, fig. 48, _R. temporaria temporaria_ [=_R. t. dybowskii_] and 123, fig. 54, _R. temporaria coreana_ [=_R. amurensis coreana_].   =Rana temporaria"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34949"],["title","Some Reptiles and Amphibians from Korea (#3)"],["body","= Günther      _Rana Dybowskii_ Günther, Ann.

SW Inje, 6 (KU); 8 mi.     SW Kangnung, 1 (KU); Taegwang-ni, 1 (KU); 1 mi. SW Tangjonggok, 3     (KU).  _Remarks._--On October 9 in the Central National Forest, five individuals were found in a concrete-walled pit in old ruins on a wooded hillside; no specimens of _Rana amurensis coreana_ were taken there. _R. t. dybowskii_ was most often taken on high, moist slopes, and seemed to be especially common in forests. The specimen from 8 mi. SW Kangnung was obtained in a wooded area along a mountain stream. The earliest date of collection of a specimen of _dybowskii_ was March 7 at Taegwang-ni. See also the remarks under the preceding account of _Rana amurensis coreana_.  The largest male among our specimens measured 65 in snout-vent length and the largest female, 79. Five gravid females had snout-vent lengths of 64, 68, 69, 69 and 70.   =Trionyx sinensis= Wiegmann      _Trionyx (Aspidonectes) sinensis_ Wiegmann, Nova Acta Acad.       Leopold.-Carol., 17:189, 1835 (type locality, near Macao, China).      _Specimen examined._--Han River, 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU).  _Remarks._--Our only specimen was purchased from a man who had captured it by hand in the Han River; it was the only turtle seen during our stay in Korea. Koreans eat turtles, and the elaborate (and relatively permanent) fish-traps that they construct across streams and small rivers probably reduce the size of populations of _T. sinensis_ and other species.   =Eremias argus= Peters      _Eremias argus_ Peters, Monatsber. preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin, p.       61, fig. 3 (for 1869), 1870 (type locality, Chefoo, China).      _Specimens examined_ (23).--Chip´o-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. E Seoul, 3     (KU), 3 (UMMZ); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 10 (UMMZ); 7     mi. ESE Seoul, 2 (KU).  _Remarks._--Individuals of _E. argus_ were most often seen on dry hillsides having a relatively sparse cover of vegetation. The first lizard of this species was taken on April 2. In 1954 the last part of March and early part of April were generally warm, with temperatures above 70° F. on several occasions; probably some _E. argus_ were active in late March. KU 38773 (snout-vent length, 51) laid three eggs between June 4 and 14; KU 38768 (snout-vent length, 58) obtained on May 8 was gravid, containing four eggs. Testes of lizards in the breeding season measure approximately 4.0 x 2.5 (KU 38772, obtained on June 16).  The snout-vent length of our largest female is 61, that of the largest male, 57. The snout-vent length of 11 specimens averaged 77 (67-96) per cent of length of tail.   =Tachydromus amurensis= Peters      _Tachydromus amurensis_ Peters, Sitzungsber. Gesell. naturf.

The other two were obtained by other persons and we lack knowledge of conditions of their capture.  A juvenile (KU 39416, snout-vent length, 25) that was obtained on September 9 is tentatively referred to this species. There seem to be three femoral pores on the left leg but the number is indistinct on the right. The specimen is dark and lacks a pattern. Its condition precludes counts of ventral scales (not keeled), but scalation is otherwise the same as a male (KU 40120, snout-vent length approximately 47, length of tail, 124). The third specimen, a male (UMMZ 113442, snout-vent length, 51, length of tail, 115), agrees with KU 40120, except in having 32 instead of 29 dorsal scales at midbody, 4-4 instead of 3-3 femoral pores, and in lacking a pale stripe from eye through ear to shoulder.   =Tachydromus wolteri= Fischer      _Tachydromus Wolteri_ Fischer, Jahrb.

NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (KU); 7 mi. NNE     Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (UMMZ); 16 mi. NE Mosulp´o, Cheju Do, 1     (UMMZ).  _Remarks._--On October 23 an individual was captured while sunning on a stump on a wooded hillside in the Central National Forest; two others at this locality were collected on damp ground-cover on the same hillside. A juvenile from Cheju Do was found among moss-covered rocks in a stream bed; the other specimens from Cheju Do were found among moss-covered rocks on the western slope of Halla San.  Each ovary of a female obtained on October 23 contained five enlarged follicles, about 1 mm. in diameter. The left testis of a male obtained on August 10 seemed enlarged, indicating possible sexual activity, and measured approximately 6 x 2 mm. The snout-vent length of our largest male is 41, that of our largest female, 48. The prefrontals are in contact in all of our specimens save one (UMMZ 113446).  There is disagreement among herpetologists concerning the generic name of the small lygosome skink in the United States and its ecological equivalent in China and Korea. We tentatively use _Lygosoma_ (Conant, 1951:207-208), although Mittleman (1950) pointed out reasons for using _Scincella_. Shannon (1956:41) discussed the debated issue whether or not the lygosome skinks of the New and Old worlds are conspecific.   =Rhabdophis tigrina lateralis= (Berthold)      _Tropidonotus lateralis_ Berthold, Nachrichten Gesell. Wiss.       Göttingen, p. 180, 1859 (type locality, China).      _Specimens examined_ (26).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 1 (KU); 2 mi. N Chip´o-ri, 2 (KU); 3 mi. NW Chip´o-ri,     4 (KU); 4 mi. N Ch´onan, 1 (KU); 3 mi. S Kumhwa, 1 (KU); 1 mi. SW     Naegong-ni, 1 (KU); 4 mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU); 5 mi. E Seoul, 2 (UMMZ);     5 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU), 4 (UMMZ); 7 mi. ESE     Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 2 (KU); 5 mi. NE     Taejon, 1 (KU).  _Remarks._--This common, vagrant species was found on brushy hillsides, near buildings on hills above rice fields, in tall grasses near streams, in rice fields, and along drainage and irrigation ditches. The earliest and latest dates of collection were April 5 and November 7. On the first date mentioned an individual was found in hibernation with five _Elaphe rufodorsata_ and one _Agkistrodon halys_ in an earthen Korean burial mound. The specimen was uncovered by a bulldozer at a depth of about one foot below the surface. We were told that 18 snakes of this species were found in the same place (7 mi. ESE Seoul) the previous winter.  The stomach of each of four individuals contained one _Rana nigromaculata_. The stomach of another individual contained a _R. nigromaculata_ and remains of a carabid beetle, whereas another contained three small, partially-digested frogs that appeared to be _Hyla arborea_. P. M. Youngman reported to us that he found a snake of this species that was attempting to swallow a toad, _Bufo bufo gargarizans_. One of the small individuals from Cheju Do was being eaten by a _Zamenis spinalis_ when found. One specimen was parasitized by three nematodes, _Kalicephalus natricis_ (see Olsen, 1957:208).  Two females of this oviparous species (lengths of body, 680 and 700) collected on May 14 contained nine eggs (18 mm. long), and 13 eggs (15 mm.) respectively; a third (length of body, 610) obtained on June 26 contained 10 eggs that were approximately 18 mm. long. A female (UMMZ 113458, length of body, 710), which was captured on July 10 and kept alive in captivity, laid 11 eggs on August 12 between 9 and 10 in the morning. The weight of nine of these eggs averaged 3.32 (3.0-3.6) grams; the last two eggs deposited were small and weighed only 1.3 and 1.4 grams. The eggs were incubated unsuccessfully. One that was opened on September 14 and another opened on September 26 contained young easily recognized as of this species. In captivity the parent snake underwent ecdysis on about July 20 and again on August 26.  Our largest female and largest male have respective total lengths of 1013 (840 + 173) and 740 (575 + 165). Our smallest specimens, captured on September 9, measured 215 and 230 mm. in length of body, and probably represent young of the year. The snake found in hibernation on April 5 measured 275 in length of body. The ventrals of 11 males averaged 161.3 (158-171) and those of 14 females, 165.1 (160-170); subcaudals of eight males averaged 69.6 (66-74) and those of 14 females, 61.5 (52-73).  Males seem to have small scales in the anal region that are more strongly keeled than scales elsewhere on the body (the scales catch on finger tips when rubbed in a posteroanterior direction), but males lack small tubercles on the upper and lateral parts of the head as mentioned by Maslin (1950:433). The comments of the same author (_op. cit._:434) concerning integumental poison glands in the nuchal region of this species are of interest in view of several reports that we received of swollen extremities resulting from handling snakes of this species.
