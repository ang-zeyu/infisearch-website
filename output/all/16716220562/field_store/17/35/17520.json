Ozone generators of the form shown on next page (Fig. 19), afford an interesting example of the insertion of smaller tubes into larger.  On account of the small space that may be left between the inner and outer tubes of an ozone generator, and of the length of the inner tube, its construction needs great care. I find the following mode of procedure gives good results. Select the pieces of tube for this instrument as free from curvature as possible. For the inner tube, a tube 12 mm., or rather more, in external diameter, and of rather thin glass, is drawn out, as for closing, until only a very narrow tube remains at _C_, the end of _C_ is closed the area round _C_ is carefully blown into shape, so that by melting off _C_ the tube _A_ will be left with a well-rounded end. A small bulb of glass is next blown on _A_ at _B_. This bulb must be of slightly greater diameter than the contracted end _E_ of the larger tube (II.), so that _B_ will just fail to pass through _E_. The length from _B_ to _C_ must not be made greater than from _E_ to _G_ on the outside tube. The end at _C_ is then to be cut off so as to leave a pin-hole in the end of _A_.  [Illustration: FIG. 19.]  The outer tube (II.), whose diameter may be 5 or 6 mm. greater than that of _A_, is prepared by sealing a side tube on it at _F_, after previously contracting the end _E_. For this purpose the end _E_ should be closed and rounded, and then re-heated and blown out till the bulb bursts. To ensure that the diameter of the opening is less than that of the tube, care must be taken not to re-heat too large an area of the end before blowing it out. It is very important that the cross section at _E_ shall be in a plane at right angles to the axis of the tube.  Wrap a strip of writing paper, one inch in breadth, closely round the end of _A_ at _C_ till the tube and paper will only just pass easily into the mouth _D_ of the outer tube, push the inner tube _A_, with the paper upon it, into _D_, and when the paper is entirely within _D_, withdraw _A_, and cautiously push the paper a little further into the outer tube. Insert _A_ into _DE_ through _E_, so that the bulb _B_ is embraced by _E_. Close _D_ with a cork. Ascertain that the paper does not fit sufficiently tightly between the two tubes to prevent the free passage of air, by blowing into the mouth _K_ of _A_. Air should escape freely from _E_ when this is done. Gradually bring the line of contact of _B_ and _E_ and the surrounding parts of the tube before a pointed flame, after previously warming them by holding near a larger flame, and rotate them before the flame so that the glass may soften and adhere. Then heat the joint spot by spot as usual. In blowing this joint, take care that the glass on each side of the actual joint is slightly expanded. It should present the form shown by the dotted lines in III. (these are purposely exaggerated, however). Finally, heat the whole joint between the lines _JI_ till it softens, and simultaneously blow and draw it into its final shape as seen at III.  The side tube _F_ should not be too near the end _E_. If, however, it is necessary to have them close together, the joint _F_ must be very carefully annealed when it is made; it must also be very cautiously warmed up before the construction of the joint at _H_ is begun, and must be kept warm by letting the flame play over it from time to time during the process of making the latter joint.  A good joint may be recognised by its freedom from lumps of glass, its regularity of curve, and by a sensibly circular line at _H_, where the two tubes are united.  When the joint after annealing has become quite cold, the pin-hole at _C_ on the inner tube may be closed, after removing the paper support, by warming the outer tube, and then directing a fine pointed flame through _D_ on to _C_. And the end _D_ of the outer tube may be closed in the ordinary manner, or a narrow tube may be sealed to it. As the end of glass at _D_ will be too short to be held by the fingers when hot, another piece of tube of similar diameter must be attached to it to serve as a handle (see p. 35, Fig. 9).   =Blowing a Bulb or Globe of Glass.=--For this purpose it is very important that the glass tube employed shall be of uniform substance. The size and thickness of the tube to be employed depends partly on the dimensions of the bulb desired, and partly on the size of neck that is required for the bulb. It is easier to blow large bulbs on large-sized tubes than on those of smaller size. When it is necessary to make a large globe on a small tube, it can be done, however, if great care be taken to avoid overheating that part of the small tube which is nearest to the mass of viscous glass from which the bulb is to be formed. For the purpose of blowing a very large bulb on a small tube, it is best to unite a wide tube to that which is to serve as the neck, as it will save some time in collecting the necessary mass of glass from which to form the globe.  [Illustration: FIG. 20.]  _To blow a Bulb at the End of a Tube._--Select a good piece of tube, say 1·5 cm. in diameter, and about 30 cm. long; draw out one end to a light tail (_a_, Fig. 20) about 3 inches in length. Then heat up a _short_ length of the tube at _b_, with a small brush flame, by rotating the glass in the flame, and gently press it together when soft to thicken it; blow into it if necessary to preserve the regularity of its figure. Repeat this process on the portion of tube nearest to that which has been first thickened, and so on, till as much glass has been heated and thickened as you judge will serve to make a bulb of the size desired. You should have a mass of glass somewhat resembling that shown at _B_ (Fig. 20), but probably consisting of the results of more successive operations than are suggested in that diagram. Apply the flame as before to the narrower parts _cc_ of _B_, gently compress and blow until all the small bulbs first made are brought together into a mass still somewhat resembling the enlarged end of _B_, but more nearly cylindrical, with the glass as regularly distributed as possible, and of such length from _d_ to the contracted part that the whole of it may easily be heated simultaneously with the large brush flame of your blow-pipe. Take great care in the foregoing operations not to allow the sides of the mass of glass to fall in and run together, and, on the other hand, do not reduce the thickness of the glass needlessly by blowing it more than is necessary to give the glass as regular a form as possible. When you are satisfied with the mass of glass you have collected, melt off the tail _a_, and remove the pointed end of glass that remains, as directed on page 33. Turn on as large a brush flame as is necessary to envelop the whole mass of glass that you have collected, and heat it with constant rotation, so that it may gradually run together to the form seen at _C_ (Fig. 20), taking care that it does not get overheated near _d_, or the tube which is to form the neck will soften and give way.  The position in which the mass of heated glass is to be held will depend upon circumstances; if the mass of glass be not too great, it is best to keep it in a nearly horizontal position. If the mass of glass be very large, it may be necessary to incline the end _B_ downwards; but as that is apt to result in an excess of glass accumulating towards _d_, avoid doing so if possible by rotating the glass steadily and rapidly. If at any time the glass shows indications of collapsing, it must be removed from the flame and gently blown into shape, during which operation it may be rotated in the perpendicular position; indeed, to promote a regular distribution of the glass by allowing it plenty of time to collect, it is well from time to time to remove the heated mass of glass from the flame, and slightly expand it by blowing. Finally, when a regular mass of glass, such as is shown at _C_ (Fig. 20) has been obtained, remove it from the flame, and blow it to its final dimensions. A succession of gentle puffs _quickly_ succeeding each other should be employed, in order that the progress of the bulb may be more easily watched and arrested at the right moment. During the process of blowing, the hot glass must be steadily rotated.  To collect the glass for blowing a bulb of lead glass, employ the flame described on pp. 17-22 for heating lead glass.  If the tube be held horizontally whilst the globe is blown, its form will most nearly approach that of a true globe. If it be held in the perpendicular position, with the mass of glass depending from it, the form of the bulb will usually be somewhat elongated. If it be held perpendicularly, with the mass of glass upwards, the resulting bulb will be flattened.  When a bulb is not of a sufficiently regular form, it may sometimes be re-made by re-collecting the glass, and re-blowing it. The greatest care is needed at the earlier stages of re-heating to prevent the glass from collapsing into a formless and unworkable mass. This is to be prevented in all such cases by gently blowing it into shape from time to time whilst gathering the glass.  [Illustration: FIG. 21.]  _To blow a Bulb between two Points_ (Fig 21).--Select a piece of suitable tube, seal or cork one end, gather together a mass of glass at the desired part, as directed for blowing a bulb at the end of a tube; when a mass of glass has been collected of sufficient thickness, blow it into shape from the open end of the tube by a rapid succession of short blasts of air, till the expanding glass attains the desired dimensions. The tube must be held horizontally, and must be rotated steadily during the process. By slightly pressing together the glass while blowing, the bulb will be flattened; by slightly drawing apart the two ends of the tube, it will be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33966"],["title","Occurrence of the Garter Snake, Thamnophis sirtalis, in the Great Plains and (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's Note: Original spelling and punctuation have been retained.

FITCH AND T. PAUL MASLIN   INTRODUCTION  The common garter snake (_Thamnophis sirtalis_) has by far the most extensive geographic range of any North American reptile, covering most of the continental United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from south of the Mexican boundary far north into Canada and southeastern Alaska. Of the several recognized subspecies, the eastern _T. s. sirtalis_ has the most extensive range, but that of _T. s. parietalis_ in the region between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains is almost as large. The more western _T. s. fitchi_ occurring from the Oregon and California coasts east through the northern Great Basin, has the third largest range, while the far western subspecies _pickeringi_, _concinnus_, _infernalis_ and _tetrataenia_, and the Texan _T. s. annectens_ all have relatively small ranges.  Since the publication of Ruthven's revision of the genus _Thamnophis_ more than 50 years ago, little attention has been devoted to the study of this widespread and variable species, except in the Pacific Coast states (Van Denburgh, 1918; Fitch, 1941; Fox, 1951). However, Brown (1950) described the new subspecies _annectens_ in eastern Texas, and many local studies have helped to clarify the distribution of the species in the eastern part of the continent and to define the zone of intergradation between the subspecies _sirtalis_ and _parietalis_. In our study attention has been focused upon _parietalis_ in an attempt to determine its western limits and its relationships to the subspecies that replace it farther west.   TAXONOMIC HISTORY  _Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis_ Say was described (as _Coluber parietalis_) in 1823 from a specimen obtained in what is now Washington County, Nebraska, on the west side of the Missouri River three miles upstream from the mouth of Boyer's River [Iowa], or approximately eight miles north of Omaha. Although the type locality was unequivocally stated in the original description, Nebraska was not mentioned since the state was not yet in existence. Because the mouth of Boyer's River, the landmark by means of which the type locality is defined, is in Iowa, the impression has been imparted that the type locality itself is in Iowa (Schmidt, 1953:175), and to our knowledge the type locality has never been associated with Nebraska in the literature.  Like all the more western subspecies, _parietalis_ is strikingly different from typical _sirtalis_ in having conspicuous red markings. The relationship between the two was early recognized. Several of the other subspecies were originally described as distinct species. _Coluber infernalis_ Blainville, 1835; _Tropidonotus concinnus_ Hallowell, 1852; _Eutainia pickeringi_ Baird and Girard, 1853; and others now considered synonyms eventually came to be recognized as conspecific with _Thamnophis sirtalis_. Ruthven (1908:166-173) allocated all western _sirtalis_ to either _parietalis_ or _concinnus_, the latter including the populations of the northwest coast in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.  Subsequent more detailed studies by later workers with more abundant material led to the recognition of some subspecies that Ruthven thought invalid and led to the resurrection of some names that he had placed in synonomy. Van Denburgh and Slevin (1918:198) recognized _infernalis_ as the subspecies occurring over most of California and southern Oregon, differing from more northern populations in having more numerous ventrals and caudals and a paler ground color. Fitch (1941:575) revived the name _pickeringii_ for a melanistic population of western Washington and southwestern British Columbia, restricting the name _concinnus_ to a red-headed and melanistic population of northwestern Oregon, and restricting the name _infernalis_ to a pale-colored population in the coastal strip of California.  These changes left most of the populations formerly included in _concinnus_ and _infernalis_ without a name, and Fitch (_op. cit._) revived _Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia_ (Cope) to apply to them. However, Fox (1951:257) demonstrated that the type of _T. s. tetrataenia_ came from the San Francisco peninsula (rather than from \"Pit River, California\" as erroneously stated in the original description) and that the name was applicable to a localized peninsular population rather than to the wide-ranging far western subspecies, which he named _T. s. fitchi_. The range of _fitchi_ includes California west of the Colorado and Mohave deserts (except for the narrow strip of coast occupied by _infernalis_ and _tetrataenia_), Oregon except the northwestern part, Washington east of the Cascade Range, most of British Columbia, extreme southeastern Alaska (occurring farther north than any other terrestrial reptile of North America) and parts of Idaho.  Neither Fox (1951) nor Fitch (1941) defined the eastern limits of _fitchi_ or discussed its relationship to the subspecies _parietalis_. Wright and Wright (1957:849) stated: \"Fitch ... did not even mention the big scrap basket form _parietalis_, from which he pulled _T. s. fitchi_ (old _tetrataenia_). That comparison remains to be made, and the east boundary of _fitchi_ and the west boundary of _parietalis_ are still nebulous.\" We have undertaken to define better than has been done before the ranges of _parietalis_ and _fitchi_ and to list the diagnostic characters separating these two subspecies. Freshly collected material of both has been compared. At the time of his 1941 revision the senior author had never seen a live or recently preserved specimen of _parietalis_.   DISCONTINUITY OF RANGE  Wherever it occurs at all, the common garter snake is usually abundant. Because of its diurnal habits and the concentration of its populations along watercourses, it is not likely to be overlooked. There are few, if any, remaining large areas in the United States where herpetologists have not carried on field work. It may be anticipated that certain rare and secretive species will still be found far from any known stations of occurrence, and seeming gaps in the ranges of these species will eventually be filled. But for the common garter snake the negative evidence provided by the lack of records from extensive areas should be taken into account in mapping the range.  Most large collections of garter snakes contain misidentified specimens. The diagnostic differences in color and pattern are often obscured, especially if the specimens are poorly preserved. Many specimens deviate from the scalation typical of the form they represent, and key out to other species. Isolated records should therefore be accepted with caution. A case in point is Colorado University Museum No. 46, from Buford, Rio Blanco County, Colorado, originally identified by Cockerell (1910:131) as _Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis_. This specimen, and another, now lost, from Meeker in the same county seemingly served as the basis for mapping the range of _sirtalis_ across the western half of Colorado, for there seem to be no other records from this part of the state. However, a re-examination of the specimen from Buford shows it to be an atypical individual of another species, _T. elegans vagrans_. A specimen of _T. radix haydeni_ (Col. U. Mus. No. 3165) was the basis for Maslin's (1959:53) record of _parietalis_ in Baca County on the north fork of the Cimarron River in southeastern Colorado. Brown (1950:203) has mentioned the difficulty of defining the range of _sirtalis_ in the southern Great Plains because of misidentifications of the similar _T. radix_.  The range of the common garter snake has never been adequately mapped in the Rocky Mountain and Great Basin states. Recent general works (Smith, 1956:291; Wright and Wright 1957:834; Stebbins 1954:505; Conant 1958:328) which have shown maps of the over-all range of _sirtalis_, differ sharply as to the extent of its distribution in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, but all show its distribution as continuous over the more northern Great Basin and Rocky Mountain states. However, specimens and specific locality records from this extensive area seem to be scarce and some are based on early collections of doubtful provenance. Throughout this region the low rainfall, fluctuating and uncertain water supply, and general lack of mesic vegetation along many of the streams render the habitat rather hostile to garter snakes in general. _Thamnophis elegans vagrans_, highly adapted to conditions in this region and generally distributed over it, doubtless offers intensive competition to the species _sirtalis_ wherever they overlap and perhaps constitutes a limiting factor for _sirtalis_ in some drainage basins.  Convincing records of _sirtalis_ are lacking from all of Colorado--except for those in the drainage basins of the South Platte, and the Río Grande east of the Continental Divide--from the eastern half of Utah (east of the Wasatch Range), from New Mexico"]]]
