But to render it, the angel or messenger _of_ Jehovah, especially in sentences in which the Person designated is called Melach Jehovah, and also called Jehovah, Adonai, or Elohim, is not to distinguish but to confuse.  3d. This rendering comports with the official agency of the delegated Person, as the creator, upholder, lawgiver, and ruler of all creatures. The works ascribed to him are, in the same sentences and connections, ascribed to Jehovah.  4th. It comports with the designation by which, when he became incarnate, he was familiarly known, and which is translated _Lord_, as the equivalent of the name _Jehovah_ in Hebrew. Thus, Luke ii. 11, he is announced as the \"Saviour, which is Christ _the_ Lord.\" Campbell renders it, _The Lord Messiah_. The sense is the same as that of _Jehovah who is the Messiah_, or the Messenger _who is_ Jehovah, or the Anointed _who is_ Jehovah. Again, when Thomas saw him after his resurrection, he exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God\"--my Jehovah and my Elohe. John xx.  5th. It comports with Hebrew usage in other cases. The instances are common in which particular persons are designated by two words in apposition, indicating different characteristics. Thus, 1 Kings iv. 1: \"So king Solomon was king over all Israel;\" literally, so was _the_ king, Solomon (or, who is Solomon) king, &c. Ibid. vii. 13, 14: And _the_ king, Solomon, sent and fetched Hiram, son of a _woman_, a _widow_--_i. e._, _a woman who was a widow_; and xvii. 9, a woman (_who is_) a widow. Deut. xxii. 23, 28: A _damsel_, a _virgin_--_i. e._, a damsel who is a virgin.  When the article is prefixed to the word Elohim, it often and perhaps always is meant expressly to distinguish the True God from the false; as when the people, seeing the triumph of Elijah over the prophets of Baal, exclaimed, \"Jehovah, he is _the_ Elohim:\" he, and not the pretended Elohim of idolaters, is the true God. The import of the formula, Jehovah Elohim, is Jehovah _the true_ Elohim, and is not clearly or fully expressed by the translation _Lord God_, any more than it would be by a repetition of one or the other of those words. The meaning is, _Jehovah who is the true God_. So _Melach Jehovah_, the respective terms referring indisputably to the same person, means, _the Messenger who is Jehovah_.  But our translators render Melach Jehovah, the angel _of_ the Lord, as though the angel was a created agent; or, as though Jehovah in this connection was the Father. McCaul, in his observations on Kimchi's translation of Zechariah, defends this rendering: First, on the ground, that if the words _Melach Jehovah_ are in apposition, the translation should be, not, the Angel Jehovah, but _an_ angel, or _a_ Messenger Jehovah. But, since the word Jehovah never admits the article, and since in the formula in question the word Melach never admits it, no reason can be assigned why the rendering should not be _the_ Angel, or _the_ Messenger Jehovah; it being admitted that one and the same Person is uniformly designated by this formula. On the contrary, if this objection were well founded, then in rendering the word _Jehovah_, where it occurs alone, it should read in English, _a_ Lord, instead of _the_ Lord.  Moreover, if his criticisms were well founded, such a passage as 2 Chron. xxxii. 21, where the order of the designations is _Jehovah Melach_, would require to be rendered, Lord of the angel, instead of Jehovah the Messenger, or the Jehovah Messenger. The statement in the text just quoted from 2 Chronicles is repeated in Isaiah xxxvii. 36, where the order of the words in question is _Melach Jehovah_. Again, the formula, (_the_) _Elohim Melach_, occurs in 1 Chron. xxi. 15, and also in that and the next verse, _Melach Jehovah_, referring to the same Person.  2d. He urges that if the words Melach Jehovah were to be rendered the Angel Jehovah, then we should expect to find the article before the word Melach; because, he says, the word Adon uniformly has it when employed to designate Jehovah. But this is a misstatement. When so employed, that word, in its different forms, is generally without the article; as Joshua iii. 11 and 13: \"The ark of the covenant of _Adon_,\" translated _the_ Lord, \"of all the earth.\" \"The ark of Adon Jehovah, Adon of all the earth,\" rendered in our version, \"the ark of _the_ Lord, _the_ Lord of all the earth.\" Here the translators suppress the word Adon where it first occurs; probably assuming, as in the case of Melach above referred to, that it was not in apposition with the next word, Jehovah; and seeing that if it was not, the version must be, the Lord _of_ the Lord, as they rendered Melach Jehovah, the angel _of_ the Lord. But the reference of the word Adon being in every such connection identical with that of the word Jehovah, and the two words, when conjoined, being, like Melach Jehovah, in apposition, the version should have been, the Lord (who is) Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth.  Again, 1 Kings ii. 26: \"The ark of Adon Jehovah,\" rendered, the ark of the Lord God; where the two words are taken to be in apposition: and if the translator felt a difficulty, he would seem to have sought to avoid it, as in other like instances, by an unusual version of the word Jehovah. Again, 2 Kings xxii. 6: \"Go up, for Adon,\" rendered _the_ Lord, \"shall deliver it.\" And to give but one other out of very numerous instances, Ps. lxviii. 20: \"Unto Jehovah Adon,\" rendered God the Lord, \"belong the issues from death.\" In all the foregoing and similar instances the sense requires the words \"who is\" to be inserted or understood.  McCaul further observes, that the word Jehovah must sometimes be taken as the genitive case, and cites Mal. ii. 7: \"The priests' lips should keep knowledge, and _they_ should seek the law at his mouth, [referring to Jehovah Zebaoth, vs. 2 and 4,] for he is _Melach_ Jehovah Zebaoth,\" rendered, \"the messenger _of_ the Lord of hosts.\" But he gives no reason why Melach Jehovah in this passage should not be rendered, _the_ Messenger Jehovah, as well as in any other passage. Again, he observes, that to translate the formula, Melach Jehovah, the angel Jehovah, is plainly against the Masoretic punctuation. But that is not conclusive; for the points formed no part of the original text, and no one pretends that they were inspired. The authors of that system of punctuation were governed, in their application of the points, by their theological, as well as by their grammatical theory; and however grammatically correct they may have been in their appropriation of them in all ordinary cases, in those passages of which they held an erroneous theological or exegetical theory, they of course arranged the points conformably, so as to make the text express their preconceived opinions. In relation to the present instance, for example, Kimchi, as McCaul observes, \"considered the Person designated the 'angel of the Lord,' as nothing more than one of the many angels to whom he supposes the governance of this lower world is committed.\" Observations, page 9. Doubtless the authors of the points held the same opinion. McCaul observes, in his introduction, that Kimchi and other Rabbies of his day \"endeavored to get rid of the Christian interpretations, and to root out the Christian doctrines which had descended from the ancient Jewish Church.\"     CHAPTER IV.      Visible Appearance of the Messenger Jehovah to Hagar.   The first recorded instance of the visible appearance of the Angel or Messenger Jehovah, is that to Hagar, Gen. xvi., where the designation Melach Jehovah is repeated several times. The Messenger Jehovah found Hagar by a fountain of water. He called her by name; directed her to return to her mistress; promised to multiply her seed exceedingly; and directed her to call her son Ishmael, \"because _Jehovah_ had heard her affliction.\" \"And she called the name of _Jehovah_ that spake unto her, Thou El seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?\" The visible Person whom she saw, and who spoke to her, and promised what none but a Divine Person could promise, is called Melach Jehovah, and also Jehovah, and El. He was therefore not a messenger _of_ Jehovah, or a distinct person from him, but Jehovah himself, as recognized and worshipped under the several designations here applied to him. Considered as the administrator of Providence, the things said and done by him were in keeping with his delegated character, and with the acts ascribed to him on other occasions. There is a further notice of his dealings with Ishmael, Gen. xxii. 17, after his expulsion, with Hagar, from Abraham's house, and her abandonment of him in despair of his life. \"And Elohim heard the voice of the lad: and Melach Elohim [in our version, the angel _of_ God] called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not; for Elohim hath heard the voice of the lad, where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for _I_ will make of him a great nation. And Elohim opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and Elohim was with the lad,\" &c. Here the speaker is Melach Elohim, which designation must refer to the same official Person as that of Melach Jehovah in the former instance, for he personally promised the same thing; saying in the one case, \"_I_ will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude;\" and in the other, \"_I_ will make him a great nation.\" That the import and reference of the two formulas is the same, is also evident beyond a question from other passages, where both are indifferently applied to the same person; as Judges vi. 20, 21: \"And _Melach (the) Elohim_ said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. Then _Melach Jehovah_ put forth the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34680"],["title","The Messiah in Moses and the Prophets (#6)"],["body","of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh,\" &c. And again, Judges xiii. 3-9: \"And Melach Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and (the) Elohim hearkened to the voice of Manoah, and Melach (the) Elohim came _again_ unto the woman.\" The narratives in which these passages occur clearly restrict the reference to one and the same Person.  In the original of these quotations, the article is prefixed to the word Elohim, as it is also elsewhere, (underscored, or included above and hereafter in parenthesis,) which is by some supposed to require the rendering to be, as in our common version, _the angel or messenger_ of Elohim. But this conclusion cannot be sustained: 1st, because it indicates something different in respect to the Person referred to from the formula Melach Jehovah; and 2d, because in other instances of similar formulas the article does not occur, as in Gen. xxi. 17: \"And Melach Elohim called to Hagar.\" The occurrence of the article does not determine the construction. It is often redundant, and is prefixed to the word Elohim where it cannot be a sign of the genitive, because not immediately preceded by a noun to govern it. Thus in the passage above quoted from Judges xiii. we read, \"and _the_ Elohim hearkened,\" &c., the article being prefixed in the original. So Gen. vi. 11: \"The earth also was corrupt before _the_ Elohim.\" Gen. xvii. 18: \"And Abraham said unto _the_ Elohim.\" Gen. xxii. 3, 9, xxvii. 28, and many other places.     CHAPTER V.      No visible Divine Appearances ever made except of the Messiah,     the Mediator in all the Relations of God to the World.   Having shown that the denominative Melach, when coupled with the name Jehovah, or the name Elohim, or used interchangeably with either of those or with other Divine names, is a designation of the Messiah; that when that denominative is employed interchangeably with the names Jehovah, Elohim, or Adonai, those names designate the same official Person; and that the formulas Melach Jehovah and Melach Elohim have one and the same personal import and reference, the way is prepared for an examination of other Scriptures in which occur the same designations of the delegated ONE of whom Moses and the prophets wrote, the WORD who was in the beginning, and by whom all things were created and are upheld.  This wonderful Person often, in the course of the ancient dispensations, manifested himself visibly in the likeness of that form which in due time he permanently assumed, by taking human nature into union with his person. In his delegated official character, being the agent in all external and visible works and manifestations, and the medium of all relations between creatures and the Self-existent, he was from the beginning the image and acting representative of the invisible Deity; delegated of the Father to accomplish the works which, pursuant to the counsels of eternity, belong to his comprehensive administration. To him, in this character and in distinction from the Father, belonged all visible personal manifestations. And hence, to enforce the necessary discrimination, and prevent erroneous impressions, the Evangelist John, chap. i., on announcing the visible WORD, the WORD incarnate, as the visible expression of the glory of the Father, says: \"No man hath seen God (the Father) at any time; it is [see Campbell's version] the only-begotten Son, that is in the bosom of the Father, who hath made him known.\" And again, chap. vi. 45: \"Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me; not that any man hath seen the Father;\" (or, as rendered by Campbell,) \"not that any man, except him who is from God, hath seen the Father. He, indeed, hath seen the Father,\" Again xiv. 9: \"He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father;\" that is, hath seen the image, the only visible representative of the Father. And in his first epistle, chap. iv: \"No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.\"  These statements preclude the supposition of any visible personal appearance during the preceding dispensations, excepting of the delegated official Person to whom the revelation of the Invisible was assigned; and who when referred to as Creator is called Elohim and Jehovah, and when referred to as the administrator of Providence, or in his relations to individuals and to the house of Israel, is called indiscriminately by all the Divine names and titles, whether significant especially of his Divine nature, or of his official person, agency or character.  In these multiform relations he was the great theme, as he was the lawgiver, administrator and revealer of the ancient dispensations; asserting the same prerogatives and performing the same acts when referred to by official titles, as when specially denominated Jehovah or Elohim. In both cases, from the nature and historical connection of the acts ascribed to him, it is evident that the actor was personally one and the same.  The word Elohim is a general term, employed, it may be presumed, originally, with reference only to the Supreme Being, but subsequently appropriated to imaginary deities. In the Hebrew Scriptures it occurs in several forms, as El, Elohe, Eloah, Elohim, referring sometimes to the Divine Being absolutely, sometimes definitely to the Father, sometimes to the Holy Spirit, but commonly to the Son; as is the case with corresponding and equivalent designations in the New Testament. The radical idea of this word, in its simplest form, is, according to some Hebrew lexicographers, that of interposer, intervener, mediator; derived from the intervention of air and light between all bodies in space, and indicating the universal agency of the Divine Person, primarily designated as interposer or mediator. And undoubtedly the scope of numerous passages implies this special reference, though not always apparent, without reference to other scriptures; as in Psalm xlv. 6: \"Thy throne, Elohim, is for ever and ever;\" and cii. 24: \"I said, El, [with the suffix for my, and rendered O my God,] take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. Of old hast thou laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish,\" &c. These passages are quoted, Heb. i., as having referred expressly to Christ.  Hengstenberg, in his Christology, p. 160, vol I., introduces his investigation respecting the character of the Angel or Messenger, in which he designs to show that the alleged essential oneness of the Messiah with the Jehovah does not contradict the Old Testament doctrine of the unity, by observing, \"that the New Testament makes us acquainted with God, the Father of Jesus Christ, as a Spirit, who, being every where equally present, never manifests himself in a sensible form. But besides this concealed God, it makes known to us also a revealed God, associated with him by the oneness of their nature; the Son or Logos, who has constantly filled up the infinite distance between the Creator and the creation, and been the Mediator in all the relations of God to the world and the human race; who, even before he became man in the person of Christ, was in all ages the light of the world, and to whom especially the whole direction of the visible Theocracy belonged. Although this doctrine was first unfolded with perfect clearness in the New Testament, yet we find an essential distinction between the unrevealed and the revealed God, even in the writings of the Old Testament.\"  After examining the principal passages which speak of the Messenger or Angel Jehovah, and showing \"that they really contain the doctrine of a distinction between the concealed and the revealed God,\" pp. 165-182, he thus concludes, pp. 183-187: \"We believe then that we have satisfactorily shown that by the Angel of Jehovah is to be understood the Revealer of God, who being a partaker of his Godhead, and united with him in the same nature, was the mediator in all his relations, first with the patriarchs, and afterwards with the visible Theocracy. This Revealer of Jehovah then was expected as a great Restorer in future times. This is evident from those places in the Old Testament which ascribe to the Messiah Divine names, attributes, and works; for if the Messiah were God, he could stand, according to the whole system of the religion of the Old Testament, in no other relation to the Most High God than that which the Angel of Jehovah was thought to sustain. Further, the passage in Malachi iii. 1 affords the most distinct testimony in favor of the identity of both. There the Messiah bears the name of the Angel of the Covenant, either, according to the general import of the term covenant, the angel who is the mediator in every engagement between God and men, or, according to its special meaning, the angel who established the covenant of Sinai with the people of Israel. From this appellation, therefore, it appears that the Messiah is the same as the Angel Jehovah, whose agency in giving the law at Sinai is not indeed expressly mentioned in the Mosaic account, but it is rendered sufficiently certain by analogy, and by the positive testimony of the prophet. As the Angel Jehovah, in those passages where he is expressly named, bears interchangeably the names Jehovah and Elohim, so must we often suppose him to be intended, where Jehovah only is spoken of throughout. Comp. Gen. xxxii. 24, &c., with Hosea xii. 4-6, and Exod. xx. 3, where the angel is not mentioned, and Jehovah says, 'I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.' Allowing it to have been the office of the Angel Jehovah in general to act as mediator in the transactions between the invisible God and men, his mediation must be assumed, in many instances, where it is not expressly mentioned.\" \"This identity of the Angel of Jehovah and the Messiah was acknowledged also by the later"]]]
