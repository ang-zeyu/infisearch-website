I'm afraid I can't get my reindeer here in time to take us up to the house, but we can go in the cars--hum! I don't know whether we can or not, come to think of it. Ah, do you happen to have ten cents in your pocket?\" Santa added with an embarrassed air. \"You see, I've left my pocketbook in the sleigh with my toy-pack; and, besides, mine is only toy-money, and they won't take that on the cars.\"  \"I got twenty-fi' cents,\" said Little Billee proudly, as he dug his way down into his pocket and brought the shining silver piece to light. \"You can have it, if you want it.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Santa Claus, taking the proffered coin. \"We'll start home right away; only come in here first, while I telephone to Santaville, telling the folks where I am.\"  He led the little fellow into a public telephone station, where he eagerly scanned the names in the book. At last it was found--\"Thomas Harrison, seven-six-five-four Plaza.\" And then, in the seclusion of the telephone-booth, Santa Claus sent the gladdest of all Christmas messages over the wire to two distracted parents:  \"_I have found your boy wandering in the street. He is safe, and I will bring him home right away._\"   III  Fifteen minutes later, there might have been seen the strange spectacle of a foot-sore Santa Claus leading a sleepy little boy up Fifth Avenue to a cross-street, which shall be nameless. The boy vainly endeavored to persuade his companion to \"come in and meet mama.\"  \"No, Billee,\" the old man replied sadly, \"I must hurry back. You see, kiddie, this is my busy day. Besides, I never go into a house except through the chimney. I wouldn't know how to behave, going in at a front door.\"  But it was not to be as Santa Claus willed, for Little Billee's papa, and his mama, and his brothers and sisters, and the butler and the housemaids, and two or three policemen, were waiting at the front door when they arrived.  \"Aha!\" said one of the police, seizing Santa Claus roughly by the arm. \"We've landed you, all right! Where have you been with this boy?\"  \"You let him alone!\" cried Little Billee, with more courage than he had ever expected to show in the presence of a policeman. \"He's a friend of mine.\"  \"That's right, officer,\" said Little Billee's father; \"let him alone--I haven't entered any complaint against this man.\"  \"But you want to look out for these fellers, Mr. Harrison,\" returned the officer. \"First thing you know they'll be makin' a trade of this sort of thing.\"  \"I'm no grafter!\" retorted Santa Claus indignantly. \"I found the little chap wandering along the street, and, as soon as I was able to locate where he lived, I brought him home. That's all there is to it.\"  \"He knew where I lived all along,\" laughed Little Billee, \"only he pretended he didn't, just to see if I knew.\"  \"You see, sir,\" said the officer, \"it won't do him any harm to let him cool his heels--\"  \"It is far better that he should warm them, officer,\" said Mr. Harrison kindly. \"And he can do that here. Come in, my man,\" he added, turning to Santa Claus with a grateful smile. \"Just for a minute anyhow. Mrs. Harrison will wish to thank you for bringing our boy back to us. We have had a terrible afternoon.\"  \"That's all right, sir,\" said Santa Claus modestly. \"It wasn't anything, sir. I didn't really find him--it was him as found me, sir. He took me for the real thing, I guess.\"  Nevertheless, Santa Claus, led by Little Billee's persistent father, went into the house. Now that the boy could see him in the full glare of many electric lights, his furs did not seem the most gorgeous things in the world. When the flapping front of his red jacket flew open, the child was surprised to see how ragged was the thin gray coat it covered; and as for the good old saint's comfortable stomach--strange to say, it was not!  \"I--I wish you all a merry Christmas,\" faltered Santa Claus; \"but I really must be going, sir--\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Mr. Harrison. \"Not until you have got rid of this chill, and--\"  \"I can't stay, sir,\" said Santa. \"I'll lose my job if I do.\"  \"Well, what if you do? I'll give you a better one,\" said the banker.  \"I can't--I can't!\" faltered the man. \"I--I--I've got a Little Billee of my own at home waitin' for me, sir. If I hadn't,\" he added fiercely, \"do you suppose I'd be doin' this?\" He pointed at the painted boards, and shuddered. \"It's him as has kept me from--from the river!\" he muttered hoarsely; and then this dispenser of happiness to so many millions of people all the world over sank into a chair, and, covering his face with his hands, wept like a child.  \"I guess Santa Claus is tired, papa,\" said Little Billee, snuggling up closely to the old fellow and taking hold of his hand sympathetically. \"He's been walkin' a lot to-day.\"  \"Yes, my son,\" said Mr. Harrison gravely. \"These are very busy times for Santa Claus, and I guess that, as he still has a hard night ahead of him, James had better ring up Henry and tell him to bring the car around right away, so that we may take him back--to his little boy. We'll have to lend him a fur coat to keep the wind off, too, for it is a bitter night.\"  \"Oh,\" said Little Billee, \"I haven't told you about these boards he wears. He has 'em to keep the wind off, and they're fine, papa!\" Little Billee pointed to the two sign-boards which Santa Claus had leaned against the wall. \"He says he uses 'em on cold nights,\" the lad went on. \"They have writing on 'em, too. Do you know what it says?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Harrison, glancing at the boards. \"It says 'If You Want a Good Christmas Dinner for a Quarter, Go to Smithers's Café.'\"  Little Billee roared with laughter.  \"Papa's trying to fool me, just as you did when you pretended not to know where I lived, Santa Claus,\" he said, looking up into the old fellow's face, his own countenance brimming over with mirth. \"You mustn't think he can't read, though,\" the lad added hastily. \"He's only joking.\"  \"Oh, no, indeed, I shouldn't have thought that,\" replied Santa Claus, smiling through his tears.  \"I've been joking, have I?\" said Little Billee's papa. \"Well, then, Mr. Billiam, suppose you inform me what it says on those boards.\"  \"'Merry Christmas to Everybody,'\" said Little Billee proudly. \"I couldn't read it myself, but he told me what it said. He has it printed there so that if he misses saying it to anybody, they'll know he means it just the same.\"  \"By Jove, Mr. Santa Claus,\" cried Little Billee's papa, grasping the old man warmly by the hand, \"I owe you ten million apologies! I haven't believed in you for many a long year; but now, sir, I take it all back. You do exist, and, by the great horn spoon, you are the real thing!\"   IV  Little Billee had the satisfaction of acting as host to Santa Claus at a good, luscious dinner, which Santa Claus must have enjoyed very much, because, when explaining why he was so hungry, it came out that the poor old chap had been so busy all day that he had not had time to get any lunch--no, not even one of those good dinners at Smithers's café, to which Little Billee's father had jokingly referred. And after dinner Henry came with the automobile, and, bidding everybody good night, Santa Claus and Little Billee's papa went out of the house together.  Christmas morning dawned, and Little Billee awoke from wonderful dreams of rich gifts, and of extraordinary adventures with his new-found friend, to find the reality quite as splendid as the dream things. Later, what was his delight when a small boy, not much older than himself--a pale, thin, but playful little fellow--arrived at the house to spend the day with him, bringing with him a letter from Santa Claus himself! This was what the letter said:      DEAR LITTLE BILLEE:--You must not tell anybody except your papa     and your mama, but the little boy who brings you this letter is     my little boy, and I am going to let you have him for a     playfellow for Christmas Day. Treat him kindly for his papa's     sake, and if you think his papa is worth loving tell him so. Do     not forget me, Little Billee. I shall see you often in the     future, but I doubt if you will see me. I am not going to return     to Twenty-Third Street again, but shall continue my work in the     Land of Yule, in the Palace of Good-Will, whose beautiful     windows look out upon the homes of all good children.      Good-by, Little Billee, and the happiest of happy Christmases to     you and all of yours.          Affectionately,             SANTA CLAUS.  When Little Billee's mama read this to him that Christmas morning, a stray little tear ran down her cheek and fell upon Little Billee's hand.  \"Why, what are you crying for, mama?\" he asked.  \"With happiness, my dear little son,\" his mother answered. \"I was afraid yesterday that I might have lost my little boy forever, but now--\"  \"You have an extra one thrown in for Christmas, haven't you?\" said Little Billee, taking his new playmate by the hand. The visitor smiled back at him with a smile so sweet that anybody might have guessed that he was the son of Santa Claus.  As for the latter, Little Billee has not seen him again; but down at his father's bank there is a new messenger, named John, who has a voice so like Santa Claus's voice that whenever Little Billee goes down there in the motor to ride home at night with his papa, he runs into the bank and has a long talk with him, just for the pleasure of pretending that it is Santa Claus he is talking to. Indeed, the voice is so like that once a sudden and strange idea flashed across Little Billee's mind.  \"Have you ever been on Twenty-Third Street, John?\" he asked.  \"Twenty-Third Street?\" replied the messenger, scratching his head as if very much puzzled. \"What'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34465"],["title","A Little Book of Christmas (#7)"],["body","that?\"  \"Why, it's a street,\" said Little Billee rather vaguely.  \"Well, to tell you the truth, Billee,\" said John, \"I've heard tell of Twenty-Third Street, and they say it is a very beautiful and interesting spot. But, you know, I don't get much chance to travel. I've been too busy all my life to go abroad.\"  \"Abroad!\" roared Little Billee, grinning at John's utterly absurd mistake. \"Why, Twenty-Third Street ain't abroad! It's up-town--near--oh, near--Twenty-Second Street.\"  \"Really?\" returned John, evidently tremendously surprised. \"Well, well, well! Who'd have thought that? Well, if that's the case, some time when I get a week off I'll have to go and spend my vacation there!\"  From which Little Billee concluded that his suspicion that John might be Santa Claus in disguise was entirely without foundation in fact.     CHRISTMAS EVE       Slyly twinkling in the skies,       Peeping from the Heaven's blue,     Are a million starry eyes       Smiling, Sweetheart, down on you;     Peeping through the misty gauze       From their little homes above     While we wait for Santa Claus       With his gifts of Cheer and Love.         Hush-a-by, my Baby O!           Santa Claus is on the way,         And his sledges overflow           With the sweets of Christmas Day.             Lull-a-by!             Hush-a-by, my Baby O.      Santa Claus is coming by       With his pack of pretty toys.     Fast his speedy rein-deer fly       With their load of Christmas joys.     Now they flit across the moon,       Now they flicker o'er the gold--     We shall hear their patter soon       On the roof-tops crisp and cold.         Hush-a-by, my Baby O!           Soon will sound the merry horn         That will usher in the glow           Of the golden Christmas morn.             Lull-a-by!             Hush-a-by, my Baby O.      Meet him half-way, Baby dear--       Join the jolly pranksome band     Of the Elf-men with their cheer       Waiting there in Slumberland.     Santa Claus must come along       Through the dreamy vales of Sleep.     There with all the Fairy throng       Let us too our vigil keep.         Hush-a-by, my Baby O.           Haste to Slumberland away,         Where the Fairy children go           On the Eve of Christmas Day.             Lull-a-by!             Hush-a-by, my Baby O.     THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN SANTAS   For once the weather bureau had scored a good, clean hit. The bull's-eye was pierced squarely in the middle, and the promised blizzard falling upon the city at noon held the metropolis completely in its grip. Everything in the line of public transportation in and out of the town was tied up so tightly that it did not seem possible that it would ever be unraveled again. The snow was piling waist high upon the streets, and the cutting winds played their fantastic pranks with a chill and cruel persistence.  It was with great difficulty that Dobbleigh made his way into the Grand Central Railway Station. Like other suburban commuters at Christmas time, he was heavily laden with bundles of one kind and another. He fairly oozed packages. They stuck out of the pockets of his heavy ulster. A half dozen fastened together with a heavy cord he carried in his right hand, and some were slung about his shoulders, and held there by means of a leathern strap. The real truth was that Dobbleigh had been either too busy, or had forgotten the wise resolutions of the autumn, and had failed to do his Christmas shopping early, with the result that now, on Christmas Eve, he was returning to the little Dobbleighs with a veritable Santa Claus' pack, whose contents were designed to delight their eyes in the early hours of the coming morning.  It was with a great sense of relief that he entered the vast waiting room of the station, and shook the accumulated snow from his coat, and removed the infant icicles from his eyes, but his joy was short-lived. Making his way to the door, he paused to wish the venerable doorman a Merry Christmas.  \"Fierce night, Hawkins,\" he said, as he readjusted his packages. \"I shall be glad enough to get home.\"  The old man shook his head dubiously.  \"I'm afraid you won't enjoy that luxury to-night, Mr. Dobbleigh,\" he said. \"We haven't been able to get a train out of here since one o'clock, and the way things look now there won't be any business at this stand for twenty-four hours, even if we have luck.\"  \"What's that?\" returned Dobbleigh. \"You don't mean to say--\"  \"No trains out to-night, sir,\" said the doorman. \"The line's out of commission from here to Buffalo, anyhow, and nobody knows what's going on west of there. The wires are down, and we're completely shut off from the world.\"  Dobbleigh gave a long, low whistle.  \"By Jove, Hawkins,\" he muttered ruefully. \"That's tough.\"  \"Kind o' hard on the kiddies, eh?\" said the old doorman sympathetically.  \"Mighty hard,\" said Dobbleigh, with a catch in his voice. \"No chance of anything--not even a freight?\" he went on anxiously.  \"Couldn't pull a feather through with thirty locomotives,\" was the disheartening response. \"I guess it's the hotel for yours to-night, sir.\"  Dobbleigh turned away, and pondered deeply for a few moments. Taking care of himself for the night was not, under the circumstances, a very difficult proposition, for his club was not far away, so that he was not confronted with the uncomfortable prospect of sleeping on the benches of the railway station, but the idea of the little Dobbleighs not finding their treasures awaiting them on the morrow, to say nothing of the anxiety of Mrs. Dobbleigh over his non-arrival, was, to say the least, disconcerting.  \"Oh, well,\" he said philosophically, after going over the pros and cons of the situation carefully, \"what's the use of worrying? What must be must be, and I'll have to make the best of it.\"  He buttoned his heavy coat up snugly about his neck, and, seizing his bundles with a firmer grip, wished the old doorman a good night, and went out again into the storm. Fifteen minutes later, looking more like a snowman than an ordinary human being, he entered the club, and, if it be true that misery finds comfort in company, he was not doomed to go without consolation. There were five other fellow-sufferers there trying to make the best of it.  \"Hello, Dobby,\" cried his friend and neighbor, Grantham. \"What's happened to you--an eighteen-karat family man spending his Christmas Eve at a club? Shame on you!\"  \"I am duly repentant, Gran,\" replied Dobbleigh, \"but you see, as your neighbor, I felt it my duty to keep an eye on you this night. There are hobgoblins in the air. Why are you not at home in the bosom of your family yourself?\"  \"The walking is too bad,\" said Grantham. \"And, besides, that confounded valet of mine forgot to put my snowshoes in my suit-case.\"  \"They say the river is frozen solid all the way up,\" put in Billie Ricketts, who is a good deal of a wag, as all old bachelors are apt to be. \"Why don't you fellows skate home?\"  \"I tried it,\" smiled Grantham, \"but the wind is blowing down the river, and I live up. I hadn't been going more than two hours when I landed on Staten Island.\"  In this way the exiles strove to comfort each other, and on the surface succeeded, but inwardly a very miserable lot they were. Clubs have their attractions, but we have not yet succeeded in developing an institution of that kind which is a fair substitute for the home fireside on a Christmas Eve. Even the most confirmed old bachelor will confess to you that, way down deep in his heart, the comforts of such organizations seem cheerless and cold in contrast to the visions of smiling hearthstones and merry gatherings of happy children, that come to them in their dreams.  \"You've got some bundle there, Dobby,\" said Grantham, as Dobbleigh relieved himself of his burden of packages. \"What are you going to do, open a department store?\"  \"Huh!\" ejaculated Ricketts. \"You're a fine fellow to talk. Ought to have seen Gran when he staggered in here an hour ago, Dobby. I thought at first he was a branch office of the American Express Company--honest I did. Talk about your bundle trust--Gran had the market cornered.\"  \"Well, why shouldn't I have?\" demanded Grantham. \"Haven't I got five of the finest kids that ever climbed a Christmas tree?\"  \"Nope,\" said Dobbleigh, with an air of conviction. \"Your five are dandies, Gran, but you ought to see my six.\"  \"I've seen 'em,\" said Grantham, \"and I'll give every blessed one of 'em honorable mention as high-steppers and thoroughbreds, but when it comes to the real thing--well, my five are blue-ribbon kids all right, all right.\"  \"How you fathers do brag about little things!\" snorted Ricketts. \"You two braggarts can roll your eleven into one, and the aggregate wouldn't be a marker to what my children would be if I had any. I've half a mind to give up my state of single blessedness, just to show you vainglorious chaps what--\"  Just what Ricketts was going to show the assembled gathering the world will never be able to do more than guess, for he was not permitted to finish the sentence. It was at this precise point that Doctor Mallerby, shedding snow from his broad, burly figure at every step, staggered into the room, and, with a scant greeting to his friends, hastened to the blazing log fire on the club hearth, and kneeling before it, began unwrapping a bundle of some size that he, too, carried in his arms.  \"What on earth have you got there, doctor?\" cried Ricketts, craning his neck over the newcomer's shoulder. \"One of these new character dolls?\"  \"No, Billie, no,\" said Mallerby, fumbling away at the bundle. \"I wish to Heaven it were. Can't you see, old man--it's the real thing!\"  \"The real what?\" said Ricketts, bending lower.  \"The real thing,\" returned Mallerby, in a low voice. \"A poor little tot of a newsboy--\"  \"Where on earth did you pick him up?\" gasped Ricketts, as the others gathered around.  \"Out of the storm,\" said Mallerby. \"I found him huddled up in the vestibule of"]]]
