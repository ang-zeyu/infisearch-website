Skull: Longer; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 47 per cent); extension of nasals posterior to premaxillae less; rostrum shorter, broader and deeper; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length greater; mastoid breadth relative to zygomatic breadth less; coronoid process shorter; coronoid and condyloid processes farther apart and space between them shallower.  From one topotype and two specimens from the Colorado River at Yuma, Yuma County, Arizona, of _Castor canadensis repentinus_, _C. c. rostralis_ differs as follows: Size larger; tail longer. Color: Darker throughout. Skull: Longer; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals relative to length of nasals averages 54 per cent as opposed to 47 per cent); extension of nasals posterior to premaxillae less; rostrum shorter, deeper and wider; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length greater; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively greater; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller; coronoid and condylar processes farther apart and space between them shallower.  From specimens of _Castor canadensis baileyi_, from 20 miles north northeast of Elko, Elko County, Nevada, _C. c. rostralis_ differs as follows: Size larger; tail and hind foot longer. Color: Darker throughout. Skull: Larger in all measurements taken; nasals markedly wider (breadth of nasals relative to length of nasals averages 54 per cent as opposed to 41 per cent); extension of nasals posterior to premaxillae less; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller; mastoid breadth relative to zygomatic breadth less.  From one specimen of _Castor canadensis concisor_, from Trappers Lake, Garfield County, Colorado, and from the original description of that subspecies (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), _C. c. rostralis_ differs as follows: Color: Guard hairs lighter; underfur darker (blackish as opposed to brownish). Skull: Longer and narrower; nasals broader and shorter (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 48 per cent); dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller; distal end of meatal tube smaller; distal end of angular process rounded rather than pointed; coronoid process shorter; coronoid and condylar processes farther apart and space between them shallower.  Among known kinds of _Castor canadensis_, _C. c. rostralis_ is most like _Castor canadensis duchesnei_, from which the former subspecies differs as follows: Tail and hind foot longer. Color: Darker throughout. Skull: Nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 46 per cent); nasals less arched transversely; rostrum shorter, deeper and broader; ventral surface of rostrum less concave dorsally; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller.  For comparison with _Castor canadensis pallidus_, see account of that subspecies.  _Remarks._--Animals from Kamas, in the drainage of the Weber River, are intergrades between _C. c. rostralis_ and _C. c. duchesnei_, but their short, wide nasals and wide rostra make them referable to _C. c. rostralis_.  The available specimens of _C. c. rostralis_ are all from streams which ultimately empty into Great Salt Lake, which is in the northern part of the basin of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. Some streams drain into the Lake Bonneville Basin without emptying into Great Salt Lake proper. Beavers from these streams, we suspect, when they become known, will be found to be related to _C. c. rostralis_.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 16 (2 skins and skulls, 14      skulls only), distributed as follows: Summit County: Kamas,      5,500 ft., 6. _Salt Lake County_: Red Butte Canyon, Fort      Douglas, 5,000 ft., 1; Millcreek Canyon, 6 mi. above mouth,      7,000 ft., 1. _Wasatch County_: Charleston, Heber Valley,      5,500 ft., 8.   ~Castor canadensis duchesnei~ new subspecies  _Type._--Male, young adult, skin and skull, number 4625, Museum of Zoölogy, University of Utah; Duchesne River, 10 miles northwest of Duchesne, 5,600 ft., Duchesne County, Utah; September 23, 1946; collected by Dave Thomas, original number 160 of K. R. Kelson.  _Range._--Drainage of the Duchesne and White rivers in Utah and Colorado.  _Diagnosis._--Size large; tail long (see measurements). Color (type): Upper parts Sayal Brown, purest on head, grading to Cinnamon Buff at base of tail; underfur Fuscous; hind feet Burnt Umber; ears Fuscous Black; underparts Tawny Olive; underfur Smoke Gray. Skull: Large, massive; nasals long, slender (breadth averaging 46 per cent of length) and markedly convex transversely; rostrum long and attenuate; zygomatic arches heavy and widely spreading (zygomatic breadth averaging 81.5 per cent of basilar length); ventral surface of rostrum markedly concave dorsally, especially immediately behind upper incisors; nasals extend posterior to premaxillae.  _Measurements._--Measurements of the type and average and extreme cranial measurements of 9 unsexed adults, from Currant Creek, are, respectively, as follows: Total length, 1,176; length of tail, 458; length of hind foot, 165; length of ear, 33; occipitonasal length, 123.6, 132.1 (138.5-122.3); basilar length, 98.6, 114.4 (125.8-99.2); mastoid breadth, 60.4, 65.1 (67.2-64.1); interorbital breadth, 23.0, 25.1 (26.1-23.7); zygomatic breadth, 88.3, 94.2 (99.7-89.5); length of nasals, 46.1, 48.4 (51.5-46.2); breadth of nasals, 20.5, 22.5 (24.5-18.8); alveolar length of upper molariform teeth, 28.9, 29.9 (32.2-26.5).

Fig. 7. _Castor canadensis duchesnei_, male, young adult,      no. 4625 (holotype), Mus. Zoöl., Univ. Utah.  From specimens of _Castor canadensis baileyi_, from 20 miles north northeast of Elko, Elko County, Nevada, _C. c. duchesnei_ differs as follows: Size larger; tail and hind foot longer. Color: Guard hairs lighter, underfur darker. Skull: Larger in all measurements taken; nasals broader and longer (breadth of nasals averages 46 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 41 per cent); rostrum broader and longer; mastoid breadth relative to zygomatic breadth less; tympanic bullae larger.  From one specimen of _Castor canadensis concisor_, from Trappers Lake, Garfield County, Colorado, and from the original description of that subspecies (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), _C. c. duchesnei_ differs as follows: Color: Lighter throughout. Skull: Nasals more convex transversely; rostrum narrower; ventral border of rostrum more concave dorsally, especially immediately behind upper incisors; distal end of meatal tube smaller; angular process shorter and rounded rather than pointed; cheek teeth smaller.  Among known subspecies of _Castor canadensis_, _C. c. duchesnei_ is most like _Castor canadensis repentinus_, but differs from the latter as follows: Size larger; hind foot shorter. Color: Darker throughout. Skull: Basilar length less; mastoid breadth greater; nasals shorter and narrower; extension of nasals posterior to premaxillae less; nasals more convex transversely; cheek teeth smaller.  For comparisons with _Castor canadensis pallidus_ and _Castor canadensis rostralis_, see accounts of those subspecies.  _Remarks._--The extent of the range of _C. c. duchesnei_ within the drainage of the White River is not definitely known. Three animals from 9-1/2 miles southwest of Pagoda Peak, Rio Blanco County, Colorado, from the drainage of the White River, are intergrades between _C. c. concisor_ and _C. c. duchesnei_. They are like the latter subspecies in shape and length of the nasals, less expanded distal end of the meatal tube and the rounded angular process, and it appears best, pending the acquisition of more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34340"],["title","Three New Beavers from Utah (#2)"],["body","ial, to refer them to C. c. duchesnei. Another specimen, number 2090, Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, from Trappers Lake, Garfield County, Colorado, at the headwaters of the White River, and only 16 miles distant from the three aforementioned animals, is, however, nearly typical of _C. c. concisor_. Relying upon the original description (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), this animal is like _C. c. concisor_ in size and shape of the jugals, in size of the distal end of the meatal tube and in the pointed end of the angular process. Warren and Hall (_loc. cit._) noted that animals assignable to _C. c. concisor_ occurred throughout the mountainous parts of Colorado, and recorded them from the headwaters of nearly all the major rivers of that state. Apparently _C. c. concisor_ also occurs in the headwaters of the White River, while the main part of the river is inhabited by animals referable to _C. c. duchesnei_.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 15 (4 skins and skulls, 11      skulls only), distributed as follows: Utah: _Wasatch      County_: Currant Creek, Strawberry Valley, 6,000 ft., 11.      _Duchesne County_: Duchesne River, 10 mi. NW Duchesne, 5,600      ft., 1. Colorado: _Rio Blanco County_: 9-1/2 mi. SW Pagoda      Peak, 7,700 ft., 3 (Museum of Natural History, University of      Kansas).
