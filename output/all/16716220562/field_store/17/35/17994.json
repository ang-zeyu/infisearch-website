They stood near a large lady who was watching the Coconut shies, and presently saw a strange figure with its hands in its pockets strolling across the trampled yellowy grass among the bits of drifting paper and the sticks and straws that always litter the ground of an English fair. It was Gerald, but at first they hardly knew him. He had taken off his tie, and round his head, arranged like a turban, was the crimson school-scarf that had supported his white flannels. The tie, one supposed, had taken on the duties of the handkerchief. And his face and hands were a bright black, like very nicely polished stoves!  Everyone turned to look at him.  \"He's just like a conjurer!\" whispered Jimmy. \"I don't suppose it'll ever come off, do you?\"  They followed him at a distance, and when he went close to the door of a small tent, against whose door-post a long-faced melancholy woman was lounging, they stopped and tried to look as though they belonged to a farmer who strove to send up a number by banging with a big mallet on a wooden block.  Gerald went up to the woman.  \"Taken much?\" he asked, and was told, but not harshly, to go away with his impudence.  \"I'm in business myself,\" said Gerald, \"I'm a conjurer, from India.\"  \"Not you!\" said the woman; \"you ain't no conjurer. Why, the backs of yer ears is all white.\"  \"Are they?\" said Gerald. \"How clever of you to see that!\" He rubbed them with his hands. \"That better?\"  \"That's all right. What's your little game?\"  \"Conjuring, really and truly,\" said Gerald. \"There's smaller boys than me put on to it in India. Look here, I owe you one for telling me about my ears. If you like to run the show for me I'll go shares. Let me have your tent to perform in, and you do the patter at the door.  \"Lor love you! I can't do no patter. And you're getting at me. Let's see you do a bit of conjuring, since you're so clever an all.\"  \"Right you are,\" said Gerald firmly. \"You see this apple? Well, I'll make it move slowly through the air, and then when I say \"Go!\" it'll vanish.\"  \"Yes into your mouth! Get away with your nonsense.\"  \"You're too clever to be so unbelieving,\" said Gerald. \"Look here!\"  He held out one of the little apples, and the woman saw it move slowly and unsupported along the air.  \"Now go!\" cried Gerald, to the apple, and it went. \"How's that?\" he asked, in tones of triumph.  The woman was glowing with excitement, and her eyes shone. \"The best I ever see!\" she whispered. \"I'm on, mate, if you know any more tricks like that.\"  \"Heaps,\" said Gerald confidently; \"hold out your hand.\" The woman held it out; and from nowhere, as it seemed, the apple appeared and was laid on her hand. The apple was rather damp.  She looked at it a moment, and then whispered:  \"Come on! there's to be no one in it but just us two. But not in the tent. You take a pitch here, 'longside the tent. It's worth twice the money in the open air.\"  \"But people won't pay if they can see it all for nothing.\"  \"Not for the first turn, but they will after  you see. And you'll have to do the patter.\"  \"Will you lend me your shawl?\" Gerald asked. She unpinned it it was a red and black plaid and he spread it on the ground as he had seen Indian conjurers do, and seated himself cross-legged behind it.  \"I mustn't have anyone behind me, that's all,\" he said; and the woman hastily screened off a little enclosure for him by hanging old sacks to two of the guy-ropes of the tent. \"Now I'm ready, he said. The woman got a drum from the inside of the tent and beat it. Quite soon a little crowd had collected.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Gerald, \"I come from India, and I can do a conjuring entertainment the like of which you've never seen. When I see two shillings on the shawl I'll begin.\"  \"I dare say you will!\" said a bystander; and there were several short, disagreeable laughs.  \"Of course,\" said Gerald, \"if you can't afford two shillings between you\" there were about thirty people in the crowd by now \"I say no more.\"  Two or three pennies fell on the shawl, then a few more then the fall of copper ceased.  \"Ninepence,\" said Gerald. \"Well, I've got a generous nature. You'll get such a ninepennyworth as you've never had before. I don't wish to deceive you I have an accomplice, but my accomplice is invisible.\"  The crowd snorted.  \"By the aid of that accomplice,\" Gerald went on, \"I will read any letter that any of you may have in your pocket. If one of you will just step over the rope and stand beside me, my invisible accomplice will read that letter over his shoulder.\"  A man stepped forward, a ruddy-faced, horsy-looking person. He pulled a letter from his pocket and stood plain in the sight of all, in a place where everyone saw that no one could see over his shoulder.  \"Now!\" said Gerald. There was a moment's pause. Then from quite the other side of the enclosure came a faint, faraway, sing-song voice. It said:  \"SIR Yours of the fifteenth duly to hand. With regard to the mortgage on your land, we regret our inability \"  \"Stow it!\" cried the man, turning threateningly on Gerald.  He stepped out of the enclosure explaining that there was nothing of that sort in his letter; but nobody believed him, and a buzz of interested chatter began in the crowd, ceasing abruptly when Gerald began to speak.  \"Now,\" said he, laying the nine pennies down on the shawl, \"you keep your eyes on those pennies, and one by one you'll see them disappear.\"  And of course they did. Then one by one they were laid down again by the invisible hand of Mabel. The crowd clapped loudly. \"Bravo!\" \"That's something like!\" \"Show us another!\" cried the people in the front rank. And those behind pushed forward.  \"Now,\" said Gerald, \"you've seen what I can do, but I don't do any more till I see five shillings on this carpet.\"  And in two minutes seven-and-threepence lay there and Gerald did a little more conjuring.  When the people in front didn't want to give any more money, Gerald asked them to stand back and let the others have a look in. I wish I had time to tell you of all the tricks he did the grass round his enclosure was absolutely trampled off by the feet of the people who thronged to look at him. There is really hardly any limit to the wonders you can do if you have an invisible accomplice. All sorts of things were made to move about, apparently by themselves, and even to vanish into the folds of Mabel's clothing. The woman stood by, looking more and more pleasant as she saw the money come tumbling in, and beating her shabby drum every time Gerald stopped conjuring.  The news of the conjurer had spread all over the fair. The crowd was frantic with admiration. The man who ran the coconut shies begged Gerald to throw in his lot with him; the owner of the rifle gallery offered him free board and lodging and go shares; and a brisk, broad lady, in stiff black silk and a violet bonnet, tried to engage him for the forthcoming Bazaar for Reformed Bandsmen.  And all this time the others mingled with the crowd  quite unobserved, for who could have eyes for anyone but Gerald? It was getting quite late, long past tea-time, and Gerald, who was getting very tired indeed, and was quite satisfied with his share of the money, was racking his brains for a way to get out of it.  \"How are we to hook it?\" he murmured, as Mabel made his cap disappear from his head by the simple process of taking it off and putting it in her pocket.  \"They'll never let us get away. I didn't think of that before.\"  \"Let me think!\" whispered Mabel; and next moment she said, close to his ear: \"Divide the money, and give her something for the shawl. Put the money on it and say. . .\" She told him what to say.  Gerald's pitch was in the shade of the tent; otherwise, of course, everyone would have seen the shadow of the invisible Mabel as she moved about making things vanish.  Gerald told the woman to divide the money, which she did honestly enough.  \"Now,\" he said, while the impatient crowd pressed closer and closer, \"I'll give you five bob for your shawl.  \"Seven-and-six,\" said the woman mechanically.  \"Righto!\" said Gerald, putting his heavy share of the money in his trouser pocket.  \"This shawl will now disappear,\" he said, picking it up. He handed it to Mabel, who put it on; and, of course, it disappeared. A roar of applause went up from the audience.  \"Now,\" he said, \"I come to the last trick of all. I shall take three steps backwards and vanish. He took three steps backwards, Mabel wrapped the invisible shawl round him, and he did not vanish. The shawl, being invisible, did not conceal him in the least.  \"Yah!\" cried a boy's voice in the crowd. \"Look at \"im! \"E knows \"e can't do it.\"  \"I wish I could put you in my pocket,\" said Mabel. The crowd was crowding closer. At any moment they might touch Mabel, and then anything might happen  simply anything. Gerald took hold of his hair with both hands, as his way was when he was anxious or discouraged. Mabel, in invisibility, wrung her hands, as people are said to do in books  that is, she clasped them and squeezed very tight.  \"Oh!\" she whispered suddenly, \"it's loose. I can get it off.\"  \"Not \"  \"Yes the ring.\"  \"Come on, young master. Give us summat for our money,\" a farm labourer shouted.  \"I will,\" said Gerald. \"This time I really will vanish. Slip round into the tent,\" he whispered to Mabel.  \"Push the ring under the canvas. Then slip out at the back and join the others. When I see you with them I'll disappear. Go slow, and I'll catch you up.\"  \"It's me,\" said a pale and obvious Mabel in the ear of Kathleen. \"He's got the ring; come on, before the crowd begins to scatter.\"  As they went out of the gate they heard a roar of surprise and annoyance rise from the crowd, and knew that this time Gerald really had disappeared.  They had gone a mile before they heard footsteps on the road, and looked back.

For a long time, my Dear Mother, I have desired to couple remembrance of you with some of my works; and finally have chosen this Discourse upon our great Prophet-Teacher to carry with it that distinction. To all who read this Discourse, then, I desire to say that I love and honor you; and that your love for me has ever been an inspiration to my work.     JOSEPH SMITH THE PROPHET-TEACHER  A Discourse[A]  [Footnote A: This discourse was delivered at the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, on Sunday, December 22nd, 1907, at a Memorial Service held in honor of the one hundred and second anniversary of the Prophet's birth, 23rd December 1805.]  ---  Tomorrow will be the one hundred and second anniversary of the birth of Joseph Smith, whom most of you here present believe was a Prophet of God. I have been invited to say something about him on this occasion. It is not at all my intention to deal with the incidents of Joseph Smith's eventful life; these are familiar to you. If I could attain the full desire of my heart, I would like to set before you somewhat the value of this man as a teacher of great truths. I desire to speak of him as a Prophet-Teacher, that is, as a Prophet acting in his capacity of Teacher, a Prophet's highest and noblest office.  As an introduction to what I desire to say, I shall read a passage from a book quite famous for its literary merit--it has reached its ninth edition; also it is famous for the character sketches of prominent Americans of the early decades of the nineteenth century. The book, \"Figures of the Past,\" was written by Josiah Quincy of the famous Quincy family of Massachusetts, a graduate of Harvard, 1821; mayor of Boston from 1845 to 1849. Mr. Quincy visited Nauvoo in May, 1844, forty-three days previous to the martyrdom of the Prophet, and though his \"Figures of the Past\" was not published until 1882, the year of his death, yet his recollections of the Prophet and his impressions of Nauvoo were drawn from his journal, written at the time of that visit, and numerous letters written to his friends about the same period. Mr. Quincy places his pen-portrait of \"Joseph Smith at Nauvoo\" with similar portraits of such eminent Americans as John Adams, Daniel Webster, John Randolph, Andrew Jackson, and the French soldier and statesman, Lafayette. The passage I am going to read is the opening paragraph of the chapter on \"Joseph Smith at Nauvoo.\"     I.  A GREAT POSSIBILITY.       \"It is by no means improbable that some future text-book, for the     use of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something     like this: What historical American of the nineteenth century has     exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his     countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to     that interrogatory may be thus written: Joseph Smith, the Mormon     Prophet. And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men     now living, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants.     History deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as     this. The man who established a religion in this age of free     debate, who was and is today accepted by hundreds of thousands as     a direct emissary from the Most High--such a rare human being is     not to be disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory     epithets.\"  Reading that passage a few days ago, I asked the question: Is this rather remarkable semi-prediction of Quincy's in the way of fulfillment? Tomorrow will be the one hundred and second anniversary of our Prophet's birth. It is more than one hundred years since he came to earth, and sixty-three years since he departed from it. What evidence is there before the world that would lead any serious-minded person to believe that this prediction I have read in your hearing may find fulfillment? \"Certainly,\" men will begin to say, \"enough time has elapsed to develop the character of your Prophet's work; whether he built of wood, hay, stubble, or of gold or precious stones. Is his influence to be merely transient and local or did he really deal with some universal and permanent truths that must remain to influence mankind?\"     II.  HISTORICAL AMERICANS.   As introductory to these considerations, let us think about some of these historical Americans whose influence upon their countrymen is to be eclipsed, perhaps, by the \"Mormon Prophet.\" Among our patriots and statesmen will be remembered Patrick Henry, with his doctrine of the inherent right of revolution against intolerable oppression; Jefferson, and his \"Declaration of Independence\" and the \"Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom,\" the principle of which finally found its way into our national and state Constitutions; Alexander Hamilton and his political interpretation of the constitutional powers of our general government; Webster and his doctrine of the sacredness of the American Union of States--the statesman of nationalism; Monroe, with the doctrine which bears his name, politically segregating the American continents from Europe, and dedicating the western world to free institutions; Lincoln, with his doctrine of the rightfulness of personal freedom for every man, woman and child of Adam's race--the doctrine of the universal application of the self-evident principles of the Declaration of Independence--the right of men to live, to be free, to pursue happiness--principles he invoked in behalf of the African race in the United States. Among inventors will be remembered Fulton, Whitney, Morse and Edison; among the philosophers, practical and speculative, Franklin, Emerson and John Fiske; among the poets, Longfellow, Poe, Whitman, and Lowell; among the preachers and theologians, Jonathan Edwards and his cruel orthodoxy; Wm. E. Channing and his Unitarian liberalism; Henry Ward Beecher and his successor, Lyman Abbott, with their efforts at reconciliation of Christianity and evolution.  This enumeration does not exhaust the list of historical Americans who have powerfully influenced their countrymen, but it will not be doubted that they represent the very chief of the respective groups that have so influenced their countrymen.  Thinking of the achievements of these great Americans, and weighing the influence of each upon his countrymen, do you not really think, even with Josiah Quincy on our side, it looks presumptuous in us to hold that Joseph Smith may yet exert a greater influence over his countrymen than any one of these, his compatriots? That is the question I propose to put on trial here this afternoon.     III.  WHAT IS A PROPHET?   First of all, a word of definition: This term \"prophet\"--what do you make of it? Generally, when you speak of a \"prophet,\" you have in mind a predictor of future events, one who foretells things that are to come to pass, and indeed that is, in part, the office of a prophet--in part what is expected of him. But really this is the very least of his duties. A prophet should be a \"forth-teller\" rather than a fore-teller. Primarily he must be a teacher of men, an expounder of the things of God. The inspiration of the Almighty must give him understanding, and when given he must expound it to his people, to his age. He must be a Seer that can make others see. A Teacher sent of God to instruct a people--to enlighten an age. This is the primary office of a prophet. And now I want to show you how well and faithfully our Prophet performed such duties.  To do this it is necessary that I say something about the ideas prevailing in the world at the Prophet's advent among men--I mean as to their religions and philosophies, the doctrines by which they were influenced. And this not only as to truth, but also as to error--and chiefly as to error, for, among other things, a prophet must correct the errors of men. It is a capital method of teaching truth--this correcting of errors.     IV.  RELIGIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEFS OF ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.   REVELATION: At the commencement of the nineteenth century the general idea prevailed in Christendom that a great while ago a very definite revelation from God had been given; angels had visited the earth and imparted divine knowledge to men; the Spirit of the Almighty had rested upon some and had given them understanding by which they were able to declare the mind of God and the will of God. These were prophets. Some prophets there were who even talked with God \"face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.\" So communed Moses with God (Ex. 33:11); so, too, Isaiah (Isa. 6:1-6). But while this belief as to revelation in the past everywhere prevailed,"]]]
