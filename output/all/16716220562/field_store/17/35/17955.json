NOTES ON PHILIPPINE BIRDS COLLECTED BY                         GOVERNOR W. CAMERON FORBES.                                 BY OUTRAM BANGS.                            CAMBRIDGE, MASS., U. S.

Cameron Forbes._                                BY OUTRAM BANGS.   In the last decade former Governor-General W. Cameron Forbes has presented to the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy three large collections of Philippine birds. One of these was made in 1911, another in 1913, and the third and finest collection in 1921 while, with General Leonard Wood and Colonel Gordon Johnston, Mr. Forbes was on an official tour of inspection of the islands.  On the excursions which resulted in the gathering together of these collections Mr. Forbes was sometimes accompanied by General Leonard Wood, the Honourable Dean C. Worcester, and Dr. Richard C. McGregor, and he had also the expert assistance of Mr. A. Celestino.  During the spring and summer of 1921 Governor Forbes and party visited most of the islands of the group. Bird collecting was carried on with enthusiasm by all the members of the party on every possible occasion, but stops at the different islands were at best limited to a few days and official business had, of course, precedence. The collections therefore while large, interesting, and fairly representative are by no means exhaustive.  The following notes, which include descriptions of five new forms, are based on the three collections.  I am under great obligations to Dr. Chas. W. Richmond and Mr. J. H. Riley of the United States National Museum for making some comparisons in Washington and for giving me data from other specimens in the collections under their care.   IREDIPARRA GALLINACEA GALLINACEA (Temminck).  Twelve specimens, both sexes, mostly fully adult, Lake Liguasan, Mindanao, March and August.  The Comb-crested Jacana has been found in the Philippine Islands, apparently only in Mindanao. Specimens from that island I am unable in any way to distinguish from one skin in the M. C. Z. from Celebes, the type-locality of the species. Mr. J. H. Riley writes me that he has lately compared three specimens from Celebes with one from Mindanao with the result that he could find no differences. It is safe therefore to refer the Philippine bird to the typical form.   PLEGADIS FALCINELLUS PEREGRINUS Bonaparte.  Three specimens, two males and a female, from Mindanao, March and August.  These belong, as of course was to be expected, to the decidedly small form of Australia, Java, Celebes, etc., the range of which must be extended to include the Philippines as well.

Five adults, both sexes, Tubbataba Reef, Sulu Sea, August, 1913.  The Blue-faced Booby, which breeds in the Tubbataba Reef in the Sulu Sea is indistinguishable, so far as I can see, from the Australian form.  The color of the bill and feet was not noted on the labels of Gov. Forbes's birds; in the dry specimens the bill is pale yellow and the feet are dull greenish black.

Six specimens, two adult males in full breeding plumage, three adult females and one immature male, from Cavilli and Bancoran Islands, Sulu Sea, March and September.  I follow Rothschild in restricting Gmelin's name _minor_ to the bird of the eastern Indian Ocean, north Australia etc. (= _F. minor listeri_ Mathews), and with little doubt refer to this form the Philippine Frigate.  The color of the bill in the three females is _bright pink_, not far from between France-pink and geranium-pink of Ridgway. The soft parts were described by Governor Forbes on the labels as--\"Eyelid bright red: bill light pink, nail white, tip black; feet pale pink.\" The males all have dark bills, their soft parts were noted on the labels as--\"Bill blue-black; feet dull brownish, with a slight reddish tinge.\"  An adult female of _F. minor palmerstoni_ (Gmelin), shot by Flood, 29 September, 1895 at Molokai, H. I. (115,028 M. C. Z.) has a decidedly pinkish bill, the color of which was noted on the label as \"light purple.\"  Gmelin mentions"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35241"],["title","Notes on Philippine Birds Collected (#1)"],["body","red bill in his short diagnosis of _minor_ and Edwards's plate to which he refers shows a female Frigate with a red bill.  I have dwelt at the above length upon the red bill of the female of both _minor_ and _palmerstoni_ because it is a character that I have seen but little mentioned, and because I feel morally certain that the American bird--_Fregata magnificans_ Mathews according to Rothschild, _F. minor rothschildi_ Mathews according to Mathews--does not show it. We have a very large series of Frigate birds from America, and among the females none show any trace of reddish or pinkish on the bills, nor do I find the bill of the female described as pink on any label, or for that matter in any text-book.  This being the case, it is a matter of much interest to know what forms have a pink bill in the female, and what do not.   FREGATA ARIEL ARIEL Gray.  Three specimens, from Tawi Tawi Island, two adult males and one adult female all taken 21 August, 1921.  Compared with _Fregata ariel iredalei_ Mathews of the western Indian Ocean these are large birds with heavy bills, and appear wholly referable to true _ariel_ of Australia etc.  MEASUREMENTS.

One immature example (sex not determined) was shot by Mrs. Robb White at Sagada, Bontoc, northern Luzon in July 1913 and given to Governor Forbes. This, I believe, is the first record for the species in the Philippines. The specimen, M. C. Z. 64,621, affords a wing length of 366 mm.   XANTHOLAEMA HAEMACEPHALA HAEMACEPHALA (Müller).  Two adult males, Mindoro, July. (Also two old skins in M. C. Z. labeled \"Manilla\").  Stuart Baker, (Ibis 1919, p. 219), has already pointed out the strong characters that distinguish the Philippine form of this little Barbet. I include it in these notes merely to emphasize the fact that it must be kept distinct from birds from India, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, etc. Its long bill, dark colors, and heavily striped under parts at once distinguish it.   XANTHOLAEMA ROSEA INTERMEDIA Shelly.  Four adults, both sexes, Negros, July.  This is another strongly marked representative form, peculiar to the Philippines. It differs from _X. rosea rosea_ (Dumont) of Java etc. in its very much larger bill (averaging 22 mm. as against 16 mm. in true _rosea_), slightly larger size, darker colors, and much more heavily striped under parts.   LALAGE NIGER MITIFICA, subsp. nov.  Twelve specimens, both sexes, Lubang near Luzon, Mindanao, Palawan, Camiguin, Camotes, Basilan, Panay, Mindoro, and Cagayan de Sulu, June, July, and August.  TYPE.--M. C. Z. 64,329 adult [Male], Lubang, near Luzon, 6 July, 1913. W. Cameron Forbes.  CHARACTERS.--Similar to _L. niger niger_ (Forster), (type-locality \"in India Orientali\" which I will farther restrict to Singapore, being as likely as anywhere else to have been whence the type actually came), but larger; in color the adult [Male] differing in the sheen of the head and back being darker and more purplish, less greenish; the rump slightly darker gray and the tibia grayer, less whitish. The adult [Female] decidedly grayer less brownish above--deep neutral gray (the upper parts in _L. nigra nigra_ are hair-brown to Chaetura drab).  REMARKS.--Birds from Java are small and appear to be quite like those from Singapore and the southern Malay peninsula. The Borneo bird is a little larger and the one female before me is gray above as in the Philippine form.

Three specimens from the Sulu Archipelago; an adult [Male] Sibutu, 23 August, an adult [Male] Cagayan de Sulu, 2 July, and an immature [Female] Jolo, 2 August.  TYPE.--M. C.

MEASUREMENTS.                                                CULMEN    NO.       SEX         WING  TAIL  TARSUS  FROM BASE   86,369    [Male] ad.    57    49    16        13   86,368    [Male] ad.    56    47    15.5      13  REMARKS.--This new form which is well marked and quite distinct, belongs in the group characterized by possessing a wide stripe of yellow along the median under parts and gray sides and flanks. In the Philippines this group is represented by:  1. _Zosterops siquijorensis_ Bourns & Worcester. Negros, Siquijor.  2. _Zosterops boholensis_ McGregor. Bohol.  3. _Zosterops everettii_ Tweeddale. Cebu.  4. _Zosterops forbesi_ Bangs. Camiguin.  5. _Zosterops basilanica_ Steere. Basilan, Bongao, Dinagat, Leyte, Mindanao, Papahag, Samar, Jolo, Tawi Tawi.  I have given the new form, which is named in honour of Governor W. Cameron Forbes, specific rank because in an enormous genus, largely composed of island forms, like Zosterops, I do not know where to draw the line between species and subspecies and much prefer leaving the question to be decided by some future reviewer of the genus.  _Zosterops meyleri_ McGregor also of Camiguin Island, is a small species with _wholly_ yellow under parts, belonging in a different group of the genus.   ORIOLUS XANTHONOTUS PERSUASUS, subsp. nov.  Four adults, both sexes, Palawan, August.  TYPE.--M. C. Z. 64,180 adult [Male], Puerto Princesa, Palawan Island, 14 August, 1913. W. Cameron Forbes.  CHARACTERS.--Similar to _O. xanthonotus xanthonotus_ Horsfield of Java, but larger with longer tail. Adult [Male] differing in color in much more heavily striped under parts and in the black of chest extending farther backward to include the upper breast; and much less sharply defined posteriorly against the white under parts; back more greenish yellow; yellow spot on outer tail feather large. The adult [Female] besides differing, as does the [Male], in heavier stripes below etc., has the whole pileum, occiput, upper neck, and sides of neck heavily streaked black"]]]
