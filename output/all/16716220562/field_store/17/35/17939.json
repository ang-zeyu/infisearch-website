[Illustration: No. 11]                                HANS SACHS  Nor was Wagner satisfied with making characters who were merely people just like ourselves. (For Walter and Eva are people of our kind). But there are in the operas by Richard Wagner, gods and goddesses, giants and Rhine maidens, and Nibelungs.  Many of them have strange names. These names are easy to remember because they are strange: Wotan and Donner are gods. Freia and Erda are goddesses. Fafner is a giant. Flosshilde is a Rhine daughter. Mime and Alberich are Nibelungs.                           [Illustration: No. 12]                                LOHENGRIN  Oh, they are wonderful company these gods and goddesses, and others of the company who tell their story and adventure in the operas of the Nibelungen Ring. Here is Siegfried forging his Magic Sword Nothung.                           [Illustration: No. 13]                                SIEGFRIED  Now, as we have said, when we learn of so great a man we always wonder what sort of a boy he was. Well, when this boy was nine years old he went to a classical school. One of his teachers at least must have been very fond of him, and he must have been fond of his teacher, for when Richard Wagner was only thirteen years old he translated from Greek into German twelve books of the Odyssey for this teacher.                           [Illustration: No. 14]                             WAGNER AS A BOY  \"I intend to become a poet,\" he used to say. He read _Romeo and Juliet_ in English. Then he wrote a play in which were _Hamlet_ and _King Lear_. And there were forty-two other characters. All of these died or were killed in the fourth act and were brought back as ghosts in the fifth! He played the piano, too, and seems to have been quite as busy a boy as he was a man.  Of one composer's music he was very fond. This composer lived nearby and passed the Wagner house almost every day. Richard always ran to the window to watch him coming. This musician was the composer of _Der Freischütz_ and of _Oberon_. Can you guess his name?  This composer's father was also a musician as well as a military man.                           [Illustration: No. 15]                                  WEBER  Children will be glad to know that Wagner was very fond of animals. Here he is with a picture of one of his dogs. His favorite dogs are buried in the garden of his home at Bayreuth, where Wagner is also buried.  Wagner called his home at Bayreuth \"Wahnfried,\" which really means \"Fancy Free.\"  It is beautifully located in the heart of the old town.                           [Illustration: No. 16]                            WAGNER AND HIS DOG  Later on the boy read about the contest of _Die Meistersinger_. He was then sixteen. And he read, too, a poem called _Tannhäuser_. He kept these stories in mind until he became a man and then he wrote an opera about each.  Thus we see that we carry childhood thoughts into manhood.                           [Illustration: No. 17]  Here is a list of the operas by Richard Wagner, with their names pronounced:--      _The Fairies_ (1833).     _Das Liebesverbot_ (1836) leebes-fehr-bote.     _Rienzi_ (1842) ree-ent'-see.     _The Flying Dutchman_ (1842).     _Tannhäuser_ (1845) tan'-hoy-ser.     _Lohengrin_ (1847) lo'-en-green.     _Das Rheingold_ (1869) rhine-gold.     _Die Walküre_ (1870) dee val-kee-reh.     _Siegfried_ (1869) seeg'-freed.     _Tristan and Isolde_ (1865) e-sol'-deh.     _Die Meistersinger_ (1867).     _Die Götterdämmerung_ (1876) dee getter-day-meh-roongk.     _Parsifal_ (1882) par'-se-fal.  Wagner also wrote symphonies and a few works for chorus and orchestra, but he is so much greater as a composer of music dramas that he is known mostly for his works for the stage.

THEO. PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.                               HOW TO USE THIS BOOK   This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\" \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.  The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.  After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous pages.  The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's own book.  This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth while.                     *       *       *       *       *  This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at present a book on each of the following:      Bach                    Grieg                   Mozart     Beethoven               Handel                  Nevin     Brahms                  Haydn                   Schubert     Chopin                  Liszt                   Schumann     Dvorák                  MacDowell               Tschaikowsky     Foster                  Mendelssohn             Verdi                                                     Wagner                              [Illustration: No. 1]                           [Illustration: No. 5]                           [Illustration: No. 12]                           [Illustration: No. 3]                           [Illustration: No. 13]                           [Illustration: No. 15]                           [Illustration: No. 7]                           [Illustration: No. 8]                           [Illustration: No. 9]                           [Illustration: No. 2]                           [Illustration: No. 11]                           [Illustration: No. 10]                           [Illustration: No. 14]                           [Illustration: No. 4]                           [Illustration: No. 6]                                      Handel                         The Story of a Little Boy                        Who Practiced in an Attic                           This Book was made by                           _____________________                                 Philadelphia                           Theodore Presser Co.                            1712 Chestnut Str.

The Story of a Little Boy Who Practiced in an Attic   When we read about the great composers we learn that they come from all kinds of families.  Bach's parents were poor. Mendelssohn's were rich. Schubert's father was a schoolmaster. Mozart's father was a violinist.  The story which you are to read in this book and then write out in your own words is about a boy whose parents were neither well-to-do nor well known.  His name is George Frederick Handel. In Germany where Handel was born his name was Georg Friedrich Händel (pronounced Gay-org Freed-riesh Hayn-del). But the great composer spent so much of his life in England that people now use the English form of his name.                            [Illustration: No. 2                           HANDEL'S BIRTHPLACE.]  Look at this queer old house where the great master was born.  Handel was born in the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach, 1685.  The father was a surgeon and barber, a queer combination. We know that he did not like music, and that he was unwilling for his son to study it. Of the mother we know little. But we do know that she loved her little George Frederick, and helped him as far as she could.  The father was so determined that his son should not study music that he refused to let him go to school. He feared, no doubt, that the boy would soon learn to read notes.  But with the mother it was quite different. She observed the little boy's love of music.  In the Handel home there was a big roomy attic; the ceiling was low, and the windows had thick panes; the walls and floors were built of heavy timber, and silence reigned there.                            [Illustration: No. 3                THE CHILD HANDEL PRACTICING IN THE ATTIC.]  \"Here,\" said Mother Handel, \"my little boy can play the harpsichord to his heart's content and no one will be the wiser.\" You can imagine the surprise when the stern barber-surgeon stalked into the attic, followed by the family, holding high the lantern.  After that it may have been agreed that the boy should practice a little; not, however, that he might become a musician. \"No, indeed,\" we may imagine Father Handel exclaiming, \"my son shall be a famous lawyer.\"  One day when little George was seven years old his father set out by coach to visit another son, who was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. The little boy begged his father to let him go on the journey. \"No,\" he replied, \"you are too young to go so far.\"  However, when the coach set out George Frederick set out too on foot to follow, and he would not be sent home again.                            [Illustration: No. 4                  HANDEL FOLLOWING HIS FATHER'S COACH.]  He kept on trudging along as fast as his little feet would go. Every one hoped he would get tired and go back, but finally the father had to order the coach to stop and take him in. Thus did he show that determination which helped him all his life.  Arrived at the castle the boy soon made friends with the chapel musicians. They took him to the organ loft, where he played for them.  All were delighted with his talent. One day the Duke himself heard him play. He, too, was astonished that one so young should show so much skill. Calling the father into his presence, he pointed out how wrong it was to deny the boy the right to study music. \"The world,\" he said, \"should have the good of your son's great ability.\"  At the Cathedral in Handel's home city, Halle, there was a famous organist named Zachau. He became the boy's teacher. They must have had a busy time together, for he had lessons from Zachau not only in organ playing, but in harmony, counterpoint, canon, and fugue; and in hautbois, violin, and harpsichord playing.  If you will look at this picture of the harpsichord on which Handel played, you will see that it is unlike the grand piano of our day. How does it differ? And yet for this simple instrument Handel wrote beautiful music. Some day you will play his Little Fugues and some of the dances from the Suites.                            [Illustration: No. 5                           HANDEL HARPSICHORD.]  Handel studied with Zachau for three years. The teacher said one day, \"The boy knows more than I do.\" So he was sent to Berlin, when he was eleven years old, to find other teachers.  Here he met two famous men, Buononcini and Ariosti. The former was harsh and unkind to him, but Ariosti treated him kindly and encouraged him. They all met again in later years in London.  When Handel was twelve years old his father died. From that time on he worked hard to perfect himself in his profession. He became organist at Halle, but soon left there for Hamburg, which at that time was renowned for its music.  Here Handel began to work his way, making many friends, one of whom was the famous Johann Mattheson. One day Handel and Mattheson went by coach to Lubeck, where, at one of the churches, an organist was wanted. Mattheson wished to try for the position, but when he learned he would have to marry the daughter of the old organist he and Handel came back to Hamburg heart free. This is a fine old picture of Handel's friend, Johann Mattheson.                            [Illustration: No. 6                               MATTHESON.]  Though Handel went to Hamburg an"]]]
