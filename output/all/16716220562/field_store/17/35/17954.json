If you don't wish to talk with me on these terms, that's the end on't,\" added Titus, rising from the seat he had taken.  \"I will go with Artie, father,\" interposed Deck, who did not wish to prevent an interview between the brothers, though he thought his uncle behaved like a Hottentot.  \"Very well, Dexter; but you needn't go if you don't want to,\" said his father, who evidently did not believe that the proposed interview with Titus would be conducted on a peace basis.  \"I think I will go,\" added Deck, who hailed Artie from the bridge, and then hastened to a plank where he could get into the boat.  For a reason which he would not have explained if he had been interrogated by his father, or by any other person except Deck, Artie was very desirous to have his cousin go with him; in fact, he was thinking of postponing his excursion, whatever its object, till his cousin could accompany him, when the hail came to him from the bridge. He pulled up to the plank, the outer end of which was supported by stakes driven into the bottom of the stream, with a cross-piece above the water. It had been built for the convenience of those taking one of the boats near the mansion. Deck took an oar, and they pulled together up the creek.  Mrs. Titus Lyon was cordially welcomed at the door of the house by Mrs. Noah, who had seen her coming from the window. The lady from the village was in a high state of perturbation, and her eyes looked as though she had been weeping.  \"I have had an awful time since you called upon me this morning,\" said she, wiping her eyes with her handkerchief. \"I don't know what we are coming to at our house. For the first time in my life my husband struck me after we got up from dinner, and then hurried me down here with hardly time to change my clothes!\"  \"Struck you, Amelia!\" exclaimed Mrs. Noah with an expression of horror.  \"Perhaps it was all my own fault,\" groaned the poor woman.  \"No fault could justify your husband in striking you. But what was it for?\" inquired Mrs. Noah, overflowing with sympathy for her sister-in-law.  \"You remember that story about the arms and equipments I told you this morning? Well, it seems that my son Orly was listening at the half-open door when I supposed that no one but myself was in the house, for the girls had all gone off to the store. He heard the whole of it, and told his father when he came in to dinner,\" gasped the abused lady in short sentences.  \"He struck you for telling me, did he?\" demanded Mrs. Noah indignantly. \"I should like to give him a piece of my mind!\"  \"Don't you say a word to him about it, for that would only make it all the worse for me. Titus says there is no truth at all in the story. He has bought no arms. I misunderstood him; he was telling about a committee in Logan County that had bought the arms and ammunition for a company. It is all a mistake; and if you have told any of your family, do take it all back, and say there is not a word of truth in the story.\"  Mrs. Titus could see from the window that the two brothers were having a stormy interview on the bridge; but she stayed till long after dark, and had recovered her self-possession before she left. Noah had no supper till she had gone, and the boys had not yet returned.     CHAPTER VI  THE NIGHT ADVENTURE ON THE CREEK   If Deck Lyon had particularly noted the actions of his cousin in the boat he would have noticed that he was less decided in his movements than usual. He stopped rowing several times in the ten minutes or more that elapsed after he had invited Deck to go with him; and one who had been near enough to study his expression would have understood that he had a purpose before him which he was not prepared to execute under present circumstances.  He had listened with the closest attention to Mrs. Lyon's report of her visit at the house of Titus, and he was in a revery after dinner as he observed Noah and his son walking to the bridge. He waited till he had seen them seated on the bench, and then he walked slowly to the boat pier. He was disappointed when his cousin refused to go with him; but he was not inclined to persuade him to leave his father, for he concluded that something of importance was under discussion between them.  He was relieved, and all his vigor and animation came back to him as he pulled to the house landing. Artie was more inclined than Deck to keep within his own shell; but it was not for the want of native energy, and both of the boys were disposed to do whatever they had in hand with all their might. He brought the boat up abreast of the pier, and Deck stepped into the bow without any further invitation. He took one of the light pine oars from his cousin.  \"If you don't object, Deck, I would like to pull the forward oar,\" said Artie, as his companion was seating himself.  \"It is all the same to me which oar I take,\" replied Deck, as he changed his place.  \"I want to talk with you, and I can do it better when you are in front of me,\" added Artie, as he shoved the boat out into the stream.  \"Where are you going? You seem to have something in your head besides bones,\" said Deck curiously.  \"Besides the bones I've got a big notion in my head.\"  \"Is it a Yankee or a Kentucky notion, Artie?\"  \"I picked it up here, and it is Kentuckish. But I don't want to say anything now; for I'm afraid some one might hear me, more particularly Uncle Titus,\" replied the bow oarsman as he took the stroke from his cousin. \"I wonder what brought him over here, for he don't come to Riverlawn much oftener than he goes to church.\"  \"He acts like a regular Hottentot just out of the woods; and if there are any bears in Kentucky they would behave like gentlemen compared with Uncle Titus,\" added Deck, who proceeded to describe the manner of the visitor on the bridge when the two brothers met.  \"Uncle Titus has got something besides bones in his head this afternoon, and when he started to come over here he meant business,\" suggested Artie. \"Something is in the wind.\"  \"I wanted to stay and hear what was said, but Uncle Titus drove me off as he would have kicked a snake into the creek. He was as grouty and as savage as a she-lion that had lost all her cubs.\"  \"Did he say anything about that story your mother told at dinner?\" asked Arty.  \"Not a word; he drove me off as though I had been a cur dog before he said a word about anything else,\" replied Deck, who could not easily forget the brutal manner of his uncle. \"But you have not told me yet where you are going, Artie. You haven't any fishlines or bait, and I suppose you are not going a-fishing.\"  \"Not up the creek, for the river suits me better for that business; but I'm going a-fishing for something that won't swim in the water,\" replied the undemonstrative boy.  \"What do you mean by that?\" demanded Deck; and his interest in the subject caused him to cease rowing, and Artie pulled the boat round so that it was headed to the shore.  \"Pull away, Deck! What are you about? We don't want to stop here,\" said Artie with more than his usual vigor.  \"I am about nothing; but when I talk with you I like to look you in the face, for that sometimes tells the story better than your words,\" replied Deck, as he gave way again with his oar. \"As I said before, you have got something besides bones in your head, and I am in a hurry to know what it is all about. You can't talk it into me through the back of my head.\"  \"But we don't want to stop here, Richard Coeur de Lyon!\" protested Artie, rather vehemently for him. \"Don't you see that we are still in sight of the bridge, and I would not have Uncle Titus see what we are about for all the world, with Venus and Mars thrown in. Besides, we have a long pull before us, and we have no time to spare.\"  \"But I want to know what it is all about,\" Deck objected. \"I am not going into any conspiracy with my eyes blinded.\"  \"Pull away, Deck! I don't want that Secesher to see us stopping here. We shall come to the bend in five minutes; and then if you want to stop and talk I will agree to it, though we haven't any time to waste,\" suggested Artie as a compromise.  \"One would think you were going to set the river on fire by your talk,\" replied Deck, profoundly mystified by the words, and more by the manner of his companion.  \"We may set the creek on fire before we get through with this job,\" continued Artie, deepening the mystery every minute. \"There's Levi Bedford,\" he added, as the manager, riding on a rather wild colt, in the road leading to the fields, came abreast of the boat.  He was too far off to talk to the boys; but he waved his hat to them, and the boatmen returned the salute, as he continued on his way.  \"I wonder where Levi stands in the row that is brewing all over the country,\" said Deck. \"I don't hear him say anything of any consequence, though he may have talked to father. He did not come from New England, and I don't know whether he is a Secesher or not; and it looks as though he did not mean anybody should know.\"  \"He don't belong to the Home Guards any way,\" added Artie. \"He is a Tennesseean, and it would not be strange if he had some Secesh notions.\"  \"I don't believe he is going back on father,\" replied Deck, when the manager had disappeared and the boat had reached the bend. \"Here we are; we can't see the bridge now, and the bridge can't see us.\"  \"We will stop if you say so; but we may not get back to the house before to-morrow morning if we spend much time here,\" said Artie, as he rested on his oar, and seemed to be very unwilling to use any of the time in mere talk.  \"If the time is so short, why didn't you start out this morning? and why didn't you let me know sooner that you were going to set the creek on fire? We might have brought our dinners with us, as we did when we went to school in Derry, and made a day of it,\" argued Deck.  \"Things were not ready this morning, and I started just as soon as I saw the star in the east,\" replied Artie.  \"You don't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35206"],["title","Brother Against Brother; Or, The War on the Border (#8)"],["body","wait for the grass to grow under your feet when the lightning strikes near you.\"  \"The lightning struck while we were at dinner,\" added Artie quietly.  \"But I think we can fix things so that we can talk and keep moving at the same time,\" suggested Deck, as he rose from his seat with his oar in his hand, and stepped over his thwart to the aftermost one.  He seated himself on this thwart, facing the bow. The boys were not skilled boatmen, though they had practised rowing a good deal on the river and creek, and they had not trimmed the light craft to the best advantage for ease and speed, for it was down too much by the head. Deck asked his cousin to move one seat farther aft, and he complied readily, in spite of the fact that he was the more skilled of the two in rowing. In the smallest of the three boats at the lower pier he had often made long trips alone up the creek, besides those when his cousin was his companion.  \"That lifts the bow higher out of the water,\" said Artie as he took his place.  \"So much the better,\" replied Deck, proceeding to give philosophical and scientific reasons to explain what experienced boatmen know by instinct, as it were. \"Now take the stroke from me, and don't pull any faster than I do.\"  Placing himself in an angular position on the thwart, with his right hand hold of the seat, he began to row with his left. While pulling alone in the canoe, as the negro rowers called the smallest craft, he had been inclined to protest against the accepted custom of going backwards in rowing; and he would gladly have adopted the mechanical contrivance in use on some of the Northern waters which enabled the boatmen to pull while facing the bow. He wanted to see where he was going without turning around, and he had practised rowing in this position.  Deck was heavier and stronger than his cousin, though hardly as agile. Artie took the stroke from him, and it was quite as quick as he cared to row on a long pull. They kept good time, and the boat went along as rapidly as before.  \"Now light your match, and start the fire, Artie. We shall lose no time by this arrangement, and we shall get back to the house before morning.\"  \"Perhaps, after you understand the nature of the enterprise, you will not be willing to go with me,\" added Artie, looking earnestly into the face of his cousin.  \"I can tell better about that after I know what it is,\" returned Deck, reciprocating the earnest gaze of the other. \"But it is you who are wasting the time now. Why don't you come to the point without going around all the buildings on the plantation?\"  \"You heard the story mother told about the arms and ammunition Uncle Titus had bought for the Home Guards in order to make himself the captain of the company?\"  \"Of course I heard it,\" and Deck was unwilling to say another word to increase the preliminaries to the revelation.  \"Did you believe it?\"  \"I did.\"  \"Then you are satisfied that Uncle Titus has a lot of arms hid away somewhere in this region?\" persisted Artie.  \"I had my doubts, and I spoke to father about it on the bridge just before you came along in the boat. He thought that his brother was just crazy enough to do such a thing; but he thought whiskey had a good deal to do with the matter, especially in permitting him to tell his wife about it. Of course Sandy and Orly are mixed up in this business. But this is an old story by this time, Artie, and you have not told me yet what you are driving at,\" said Deck impatiently.  \"We are going to look for the arms and ammunition, Deck!\" exclaimed the originator of the enterprise. \"Is that talking plainly enough?\"  \"To look for the arms and ammunition!\" almost shouted the after oarsman, ceasing to use his oar in the astonishment of the moment.  \"You insisted on my telling you all at once, and I have done so; you have stopped rowing.\"  \"What you said was enough to throw a fellow off his base. Do you mean that you are going on a wild-goose chase all over the State of Kentucky to look for what may be a mere notion, conjured up by an overdose of whiskey?\" demanded Deck, still resting on his oar.  \"Don't get excited, Coeur de Lyon; cold steel cuts best,\" said Artie.  \"And that's the reason father puts his razor into hot water when he is shaving.\"  \"I don't think anybody is right down sure of anything in this world,\" continued the leader of the enterprise. \"I think I am as sure as any fellow can be in this State of Kentucky, where no man or boy can tell which end he stands on, that I know where Uncle Titus's arms and ammunition are hidden.\"  \"You know!\" ejaculated Deck.  \"I think I know.\"  \"What are you doing up the creek, then? Didn't Aunt Amelia say that the arms were concealed near the river?\" asked Deck, hardly able to breathe in his excitement.  \"I think I know where they are hidden better than she did. If Uncle Titus told his wife that they were hidden on the river,--and that is just what aunt said,--her husband intended to cheat her,\" said Artie very confidently. \"I should say that a dozen glasses of whiskey would not have made Uncle Titus fool enough to tell anybody where the arms were concealed, not even his wife; and they don't seem to be a very loving couple since they came to Kentucky.\"  \"That's so,\" added Deck.  \"Do you remember that time about a fortnight ago when father spoke to me about being out so late one night, Deck?\"  \"I remember it; it was on the bridge.\"  \"That night I found out something I could not explain, but I can now, after what I heard at dinner to-day. But we have eight or ten miles to pull if we are going to find the arms to-day, and we must be moving,\" added Artie.  Deck rowed again, and they proceeded up the creek, Artie telling his night adventure by the way.     CHAPTER VII  A STORMY INTERVIEW ON THE BRIDGE   Probably Noah Lyon had never felt anything like the emotion of anger in his being against his brother until they met that day on the bridge. As one and another had said several times, no two men of the same blood and lineage could have been more differently constituted. Noah had been a diligent student as a boy, and a constant reader in his maturity; while Titus had been the black sheep of the family, had neglected his studies in his youth, and did not even read a newspaper in his manhood, unless for a special purpose.  Titus could read and write, and knew enough of arithmetic to enable him to keep the accounts of his business. Whatever he learned after he left school he gathered from the speech of people; and as his associates were not of the intelligent class in his native town any more than they were in his new home, his education was very limited and his moral aims, if he could be said to have any, were not elevated enough to keep him very far within the limits of the law, which were his principal tests between right and wrong.  Before he was twenty-one he obtained a position to drive a stage on a twenty-mile route, so that he spent every other night at a tavern; and this did not improve his manners or his morals. As a boy he had become disgusted with farming, and had learned the trade of a mason, working at it three years. Like his elder brother, he was a horse fancier, and was a skilful driver. An accident to the old stage-driver placed him on the box, and when the place became permanent he was only twenty years old.  With so little intellectual and moral foundation as he had laid for his future character, it was a misfortune for him that he was then a \"good-looking fellow.\" He boarded at the tavern, and paid only two dollars a week in consideration of his position, for it was believed that he had some influence with his passengers. He was well supplied with money for one of his age in the country, and he spent all he had.  He was an agile dancer, which, with his good looks, made him popular in the town, especially with the girls. Amelia Lenox was a pretty girl. She had a fancy for the handsome stage-driver; and, in spite of the earnest objections of her father and mother, she accepted him as her husband, and they were married. Titus took a cottage near the tavern, and for a year, with the help of his and her father, they got along very well.  All of a sudden a railroad shot through the town, and the business of the place was gone in the twinkling of an eye. The wages of Titus stopped, and he had a wife and child to support. He went to his father for advice. The mason, who had done a good business in the town and its vicinity, had grown old. Hopestill Lyon, the grandfather of the boys, was his best friend, and bought out his business for Titus.  For several years he worked well, made some money, and paid his grandfather for the investment made on his behalf. But he did not like the business. Unlike his brothers, he seemed to believe that fate, destiny, circumstances, or some other indefinable power that regulates the worldly condition of mortals, had misused and abused him; for he ought to have been \"born with a silver spoon in his mouth,\" with wealth at his command, so that he could live in luxury without work.  When he built chimneys, plastered rooms, or jobbed in filthy drains and smutty fireplaces, he labored with an active protest against his occupation in his soul, which extended down to his hands and feet, shutting out ambition, and making him lazy. He was always on the lookout for some other occupation, or for some change which would put more money in his pocket. He did a vast deal of grumbling and growling at his lot, occasionally taking home with him a gallon jug of New England rum, which did not improve his condition. He was not a drunkard, but he was unconsciously falling into a bad habit.  His wife was an intelligent woman, and was a good helpmate; but it did not require a prophetic vision to read the future, near or distant, of Titus Lyon. It was said by some of the old people in the town that he \"took after\" his grandmother, who had been a stylish woman in her younger days, though the solid character of"]]]
