Why he should have failed to include his experiences and record the names of the men who constituted his force on this second trip has always been a mystery to various explorers of the Canyon, and especially to the members of the party, one of whom was F. S. Dellenbaugh.  In his account of this trip in his book, \"The Romance of the Colorado River,\" published in 1906, he states that perhaps this omission was for the sake of dramatic unity.  Be this as it may, it has always seemed as if for some reason Powell did not care to do full justice to the brave men who accompanied him on this trip.  When, therefore, a monument was erected to Powell on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, with money appropriated by the Congress of the United States, and a full list of the men who accompanied him on _both_ expeditions was presumably given on the bronze tablet placed on that monument, it was with considerable astonishment that I noted that the names of three men who accompanied the first expedition were omitted.  [Illustration: Inscription of Powell Monument, Grand Canyon National Park]  These men were O. G. Rowland, Seneca Rowland and William Dunn.  In seeking to find the cause for this strange omission, I turned to Powell's own report.  On page 96, under date of August 27, he tells of the great difficulties they were beset with:   This morning the river takes a more southerly direction.  The dip of the rocks is to the north, and we are rapidly running into lower formations.  Unless our course changes, we shall very soon run again into the granite.  This gives us some anxiety.  Now and then the river turns to the west and excites hope that are soon destroyed by another turn to the south.  About nine o'clock we come to the dreaded rock.  It is with no little misgiving that we see the river enter these black, hard walls.  At its very entrance we have to make a portage; then we have to let down with lines past some ugly rocks.  Then we run a mile or two farther, and then the rapids below can be seen.  At eleven o'clock we come to a place in the river where it seems much worse than any we have yet met in all its course.  A little creek comes down from the left.  We land first on the right, and clamber up over the granite pinnacles for a mile or two, but can see no way by which we can let down, and to run it would be sure destruction.   After another page devoted to discussing the dangers and difficulties ahead of them, Powell continues, on page 98:   After supper Captain (O. G.) Rowland asked to have a talk with me.  We walk up the little creek a short distance, and I soon find that his object is to remonstrate against my determination to proceed.  He thinks that we had better abandon the river here.  Talking with him, I learn that his brother, William Dunn, and himself have determined to go no farther in the boats.  So we return to camp.  Nothing is said to the other men.  For the last two days our course has not been plotted.  I sit down and do this now, .... As soon as I determined all this, I spread my plot on the sand, and wake Rowland, who is sleeping down by the river, and show him where I suppose we are and where several Mormon settlements are situated.  We have another short talk about the morrow and he lies down again; but for me there is no sleep.  All night long I pace up and down a little path, on a few yards of sand beach, along the river.  Is it wise to go on? .... For years I have been contemplating this trip.  To leave the exploration unfinished, to say that there is a part of the canyon which I cannot explore, having already almost accomplished it, is more than I am willing to acknowledge, and I determine to go on.  I wake my brother and tell him of Rowland's determination, and he promises to stay with me; then I call up Hawkins, the cook, and he makes a like promise; then Sumner, and Bradley, and Hall, and they all agree to go on.  August 28.  At last daylight comes, and we have breakfast, without a word being said as to the future.  The meal is as solemn as a funeral. After breakfast, I ask the three men if they still think it best to leave us.  The elder Howland thinks it is, and Dunn agrees with him. The younger Howland tries to persuade them to go on with the party, failing in which, he decides to go with his brother....  Two rifles and a shotgun are given to the men who are going out.  I ask them to help themselves to the rations, and take what they think to be a fair share. This they refuse to do, saying they have no fear but that they can get something to eat, but Billy, the cook, has a pan of biscuits prepared for dinner, and these he leaves on a rock.  .... The last thing before leaving, I write a letter to my wife, and give it to Howland.  Sumner gives him his watch, directing that it be sent to his sister should he not be heard from again.  The records of the expedition have been kept in duplicate.  One set of these is given to Howland, and now we are ready.  For the last time they entreat us not to go on, and tell us that it is madness to set out in this place; that we can never go safely through it; and, further, that the river turns again to the south into the granite, and a few miles of such rapids and falls will exhaust our entire stock of rations and then it will be too late to climb out.  Some tears are shed; it is rather a solemn parting; each party thinks the other is taking the dangerous course.   Thus they part; Powell and the men who had determined to remain with him to go on and finally leave the exploration incomplete at a point a little further down.  The three men who left the party--the two Rowlands and Dunn--were never seen again alive.  On the following expedition Powell spent some time with the Shivwit Indians, in company with Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon pioneer and missionary.  From them he learned of the death of the men who left him.  On pages 130-131, he thus recounts the story.  After he had talked with the Indians, one of them made a reply, and in his speech said:   Last year we killed three white men.  Bad men said they were our enemies.  They told great lies.  We thought them true.  We were mad; it make us big fools.  We are very sorry.   After the council had broken up, so Powell says:   Mr. Hamblin fell into conversation with one of the Indians and held him until the others had left, and then learned more particulars of the death of the three men.  They came upon the Indian village almost starved and exhausted with fatigue.  They were supplied with food, and put on their way to the [Mormon] settlements.  Shortly after they had left, an Indian from the east side of the Colorado arrived at the village and told them about a number of miners having killed a squaw in a drunken brawl, and no doubt these were the men.  No person had ever come down the Canyon; that was impossible; they were trying to hide their guilt.  In this way he worked them into a great rage.  They followed, surrounded the men in ambush, and filled them full of arrows.   This is practically the whole story as told by Powell.  For years it has been accepted as the truth.  Science is Truth focalized, and there is no real science without truth.  I have always wondered whether this narrative gave us the whole truth, and when I saw the Powell Monument and noted the omission of the three names of the two Rowlands and Dunn, I wondered still more.  Why should the names of these three men be left off after having traveled over four hundred miles on the maiden trip, and thus having proven their valor and courage?  [Illustration: W. W. HAWKINS]  But now comes another witness on the scene.  Some time ago I learned that William W. Hawkins, the cook referred to by Powell, was still alive.  Powell died in 1902 at the age of 69 years.  Hawkins was then living, and thus became the sole survivor (I believe) of the first Powell trip.  After the expedition he settled in Pine Valley, Utah, but later moved to Gila Valley, Arizona, and thence to Graham County, where he resided for thirty-five years.  He was Justice of the Peace for many years and resided at Eden in that county.  He also was a prominent rancher and at his death had six sons living, two of whom reside near Mesa, Arizona.  He was highly respected by all who knew him and no one of his large circle of friends and acquaintances will question the truth of this account as given to me for publication.  He died in September, 1919, at the St. Joseph's Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona.  The following account was written by him, in his own handwriting, a few months before his death, at my solicitation, with the understanding that I was to publish it, if it was deemed desirable.  Hence I now give it to the world.  The following is Hawkins' own brief introduction to his narrative:   [Illustration: Fac-simile of Page 1 of W. W. Hawkins manuscript account of the First Powell Expedition.]  [Illustration: Fac-simile of Page 3 of W. W. Hawkins manuscript account of the First Powell Expedition.]  [Illustration: Fac-simile of last page of W. W. Hawkins manuscript account of the First Powell Expedition.]   INTRODUCTION  I will write this as it comes to me and you can then take what portion you may see fit.  I will state it just as it happened, at the time it did happen.  It seems that you have the two expeditions mixed that Powell made down the Colorado River, and in order to straighten this out it will be necessary for me to give you a brief account of our first expedition from start to finish, then you will have a clear idea of the matter and I can give you a better understanding by commencing at the first.  Of course this will be some that has already been published by Powell himself, and some that happened that was not well to put into Powell's report, but they are true.  But as I am the only one that remains of the first expedition I could not prove just how things were and how they happened.   In the fall of 1868, myself, J. C. Sumner, William Dunn, O. G. Rowland and Seneca"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35268"],["title","Adventures in the Canyons of the Colorado, (#2)"],["body","owland, brothers, were camped at the Hot Springs in middle park, Colorado, about one hundred miles west of Denver, Colorado.  We were trapping and prospecting, both in that section and on White River, some seventy-five miles further west.  While our party, J. C. Sumner in charge, was in camp at this place, Major Powell and party pulled in with their pack animals, twenty-five animals and twelve or eighteen men.  After they stopped and unpacked we all went over to see what they were going to do in this wild country, and they all seemed to be equally interested in our party.  Our mode of dress was somewhat different to what they had been used to seeing, as we were all dressed in buckskin, and our hair came down on our shoulders.  I was the youngest one in the crowd.  We soon found out each other's business. Powell told us he intended to make his winter camp over on White River and in the spring he was going to explore the Colorado River from start to finish..  We told him that we intended to do the same thing, only on a small scale.  He said that only one of his crowd was going with him down the liver, that was his brother, Walter Powell.  He said he would like to have our party join him and go with him flown the river.  We had most of our provisions on White River at that time.  This was Powell's first trip with his pack animals and it would be necessary for him to make another trip, as most of his party would winter with him. After we both got over on White River where our cabins were, he said he would buy our provisions, horses and mules and our traps, and that we could become members of his party and that he would pay us reasonable wages to come with him.  So we all agreed on prices for different articles.  I had four head of animals, Sumner five head, Dunn two, and the Rowland brothers had three head.  I owned all the traps.  These he was to replace when we got through at Cottonwood Island.  So we went to work building more cabins and put up ten or twelve, and fixed up for the winter by dragging up wood, which was plentiful there.  Then we laid in a fine supply of venison.  Before the snow got too deep, Powell took the most of his party that came from the east with him out to Green River Station and he with them went east, leaving his wife and brother in camp.  In April we all broke camp and went to Green River Station and made camp about one-half mile below the U. P. R. R. bridge, and waited for Powell to return with our boats, which he did the latter part of April.  He sent all the horses to Echo Canyon and sold them. He drew his rations from Fort Bridger.  We all then went to calking up and painting our boats, which was no small job for us, for we knew nothing about a boat.  Powell got a man discharged out of the army at Fort Bridger to come and show us how to calk the boats.  This man's name was George Bradley, a man of nerve and staying qualities, as he proved later on.  Mrs. Powell went to Salt Lake City before going east. We were all anxious to get started, but little did we know what was in store for us in the way of experience and danger.  We had four boats, three of them were 22 feet long, 4 feet wide and 3 feet deep.  Each end was decked over 4 feet at each end, air tight.  These three were supposed to carry the provisions for ten men for eighteen months, that being the time Powell was going to take to make the trip.  He was going to winter somewhere in the Canyon.  His boat was sixteen feet long, made of pine; the others were oak.  They were of the Whitehall pattern. The men were assigned to their boats and then the loads were placed in them.  The Major's boat was used for a guide boat.  It was manned by J. C. Sumner and William Dunn and the Major; next was Walter Powell and Bradley; the next was the Howland brothers and Frank Goodman; the next was the cook boat, manned by myself and Andy Hall.  Each boat was loaded so as to have a nearly equal distribution, so that in case of an accident to one of them the others would still have an assortment of the provisions.  After each boat had received its load we were ready to start.  But where, none of us knew, only that we were going to go down through the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River.  We had been told that in places the water ran under the ground.  There was a great many people on the bank of the river to see us start.  We were all green at the business, Bradley was the only one that had any experience.  But he acknowledged afterwards that this was a little rough.  We had very good water for some twenty miles, but, of course, had to watch out for the small boat, as it was supposed to go where the other boats that were loaded could not go.  I remember our first camp that evening for the night and as I was steering the boat with one oar behind and standing up I could see what was in front of us.  I saw that they were all landing and I told Andy they were camping at this point.  The river was straight and the water smooth and Powell signaled to me and we tried to land, and did finally get to shore some four hundred yards below and the other boats dropped down to where we were and the rest of the boys had the laugh on us.  Andy and I told the Major that we were too heavily loaded, the water only lacking four inches from running over the sides of our boat, and as Andy said the next day, we were seven inches nearer the bottom of the river than the other two large boats, as they were nine inches above water, and that we better unload some of the bacon and take chances of replacing it with venison and mountain sheep later on.  So we unloaded five hundred pounds of bacon in the river.  We soon found out that was better.  We now passed through Brown's Park, some forty miles from where we started.  At the lower end of this park the river now runs into a bad canyon of red sandstone. This was our first canyon and Powell named it the flaming gorge, and it was well named.  We made many portages and it was twenty-five miles long.  It required ten days to go that distance, as we had to make a trail and carry our provisions and instruments from one place to the other the entire distance, and let the boats down by ropes over the bad rapids.  Of course, when we got through and loaded up again the boats were not so heavy and the Major said our appetites were growing.  At the mouth of this canyon we came to a nice little island which we called Island Park.  Here we camped a few days, for we sure had rolled many a rock two-thirds of the twenty-five miles and soaked our provisions.  I went out on the east side of the canyon some three miles to see if there was any game and run across a big buck deer coming down the trail to water about one-half mile from camp.  He stopped to take a look at me and I shot just as he stopped and broke his neck.  The boys heard the shot and Hall and Dunn came out and helped me in with it. Powell named the mountain Hawkins Mountain.  We moved on down the river, which was very good traveling for a ways and then we heard a great roaring below and saw Powell standing on some rocks on the east side of the river.  He motioned us to land, which we all succeeded in doing except Howland's boat.  It went over the rapids and broke in two and threw the men out.  They succeeded in catching hold of a large pine tree that was drifting top down stream and seemed to stop just to let the boys crawl on to it.  The river was raising fast and Sumner, with the small boat, was trying to reach them, but his two first trials failed and the tree began to move on slowly and Goodman shouted, \"Goodbye, boys.\"  But then Sumner threw a line he made to where the boys were on the log, which had moved on down a ways, but he got them in the boat and finally got near enough to catch a rope and was hauled into shore some hundred yards below.  As we had lost considerable of our provisions and one boat, of course the men had to double up in the other boats.  Howland No. 1 came in with Hall and myself, Howland No. 2 went in with Capt. Powell and Bradley, Goodwin went in with Sumner, Dunn and the Major.  But as we had good water for some time we finally came to the mouth of ---- Creek.  Up this creek about 18 miles is the Uinta Agency.  We went up to the agency--Powell, Goodman and myself. It was the 4th day of July and we had dinner with the Indian agent. Here we left Goodman.  He said he had all he wanted of the river.  From here to the junction of the Green River with the Grand River the water is very good, a distance of one hundred miles, which took but a few days to make.  The canyon is hard rock and the walls on the west side in some places overhang the water three hundred feet.  Back under this shelf was drift-wood and willows at that time, a good home for beaver and otter.  We stopped for noon and went into camp near the head of a small rapid and tied our boats to small undergrowth, and, being the cook, I had just started a fire in a nice little cove in the brush and rock.  I had just got my \"mess kit\" out of the front of the boat when a wind started up and set the leaves and brush all a-blaze.  I gathered up the mess kit and made for the boat.  But the blaze beat me to it and had burned the small ropes in two that I had the boats tied with, and they were just moving into the current.  I jumped, but missed the boat, and down I went, mess kit and all.  I held on to the mess kit until I saw I could not raise with it and so I let it go and came to the top of the water to find the boat some thirty feet from me, and Andy was doing his best to hold it up stream until I could catch it.  I just caught the boat as it was going into the rapid, but it was not a bad rapid, as the waves were about eight feet high.  Bradley, held fast to the side of his boat, was not able to get into it, but went through the rapid and a part of the time his head was under the water.  At the lower end of this rapid we stopped, as in our rush we had left the Major behind, and in order to get him out of "]]]
