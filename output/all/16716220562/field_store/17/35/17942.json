And there was my Missus, just within the law, and me all spicked and spanned with my soup and fish and gravy!  Well, we all set there and tried to get the focus till about a half-hour after the show was billed to commence, and finally a Lilliputhian with a match in his hand come out and started up the orchestry and they played a few o' the hits and then the lights was turned out and up went the curtain.  Well, sir, you'd be surprised at how good we could hear and see after we got used to it. But the hearin' didn't do us no good--that is, the words part of it. All the actors had been smuggled in from Europe and they wasn't none o' them that could talk English. So all their songs was gave in different languages and I wouldn't of never knew what was goin' on only for Hatch havin' all the nerve in the world.  After the first act a lady that was settin' in front of us dropped somethin' and Hatch stooped over and picked it up, and it was one o' these here books they call a liberetto, and it's got all the words they're singin' on the stage wrote out in English.  So the lady begin lookin' all over for it and Hatch was goin' to give it back because he thought it was a shoe catalogue, but he happened to see at the top of it where it says \"Price 25 Cents,\" so he tossed it in his lap and stuck his hat over it. And the lady kept lookin' and lookin' and finally she turned round and looked Hatch right in the eye, but he dropped down inside his collar and left her wear herself out. So when she'd gave up I says somethin' about I'd like to have a drink.  \"Let's go,\" says Hatch.  \"No,\" I says. \"I don't want it bad enough to go back to town after it. I thought maybe we could get it sent up to the room.\"  \"I'm goin' alone then,\" says Hatch.  \"You're liable to miss the second act,\" I says.  \"I'd never miss it,\" says Hatch.  \"All right,\" says I. \"I hope you have good weather.\"  So he slipped me the book to keep for him and beat it. So I seen the lady had forgot us, and I opened up the book and that's how I come to find out what the show was about. I read her all through, the part that was in English, before the curtain went up again, so when the second act begin I knowed what had came off and what was comin' off, and Hatch and Mrs. Hatch hadn't no idear if the show was comical or dry. My Missus hadn't, neither, till we got home and I told her the plot.         *       *       *       *       *  _Carmen_ ain't no regular musical show where a couple o' Yids comes out and pulls a few lines o' dialogue and then a girl and a he-flirt sings a song that ain't got nothin' to do with it. _Carmen's_ a regular play, only instead o' them sayin' the lines, they sing them, and in for'n languages so's the actors can pick up some loose change offen the sale o' the liberettos. The music was wrote by George S. Busy, and it must of kept him that way about two mont's. The words was either throwed together by the stage carpenter or else took down by a stenographer outdoors durin' a drizzle. Anyway, they ain't nobody claims them. Every oncet in three or four pages they forget themself and rhyme. You got to read each verse over two or three times before you learn what they're hintin' at, but the management gives you plenty o' time to do it between acts and still sneak a couple o' hours' sleep.  The first act opens up somewheres in Spain, about the corner o' Chicago Avenue and Wells. On one side o' the stage they's a pill mill where the employees is all girls, or was girls a few years ago. On the other side they's a soldiers' garage where they keep the militia in case of a strike. In the back o' the stage they's a bridge, but it ain't over no water or no railroad tracks or nothin'. It's prob'ly somethin' the cat dragged in.  Well, the soldiers stands out in front o' the garage hittin' up some barber shops, and pretty soon a girl blows in from the hero's home town, Janesville or somewheres. She runs a few steps every little w'ile and then stops, like the rails was slippery. The soldiers sings at her and she tells them she's came to look for Don Joss that run the chop-suey dump up to Janesville, but when they shet down on him servin' beer he quit and joined the army. So the soldiers never heard o' the bird, but they all ask her if they won't do just as good, but she says nothin' doin' and skids off the stage. She ain't no sooner gone when the Chinaman from Janesville and some more soldiers and some alley rats comes in to help out the singin'. The book says that this new gang o' soldiers was sent on to relieve the others, but if anything happened to wear out the first ones it must of took place at rehearsal. Well, one o' the boys tells Joss about the girl askin' for him and he says: \"Oh, yes; that must be the little Michaels girl from up in Wisconsin.\"  So pretty soon the whistle blows for noon and the girls comes out o' the pill mill smokin' up the mornin' receipts and a crowd o' the unemployed comes in to shoot the snipes. So the soldiers notices that Genevieve Farr'r ain't on yet, so they ask where she's at, and that's her cue. She puts on a song number and a Spanish dance, and then she slips her bouquet to the Chink, though he ain't sang a note since the whistle blowed. But now it's one o'clock and Genevieve and the rest o' the girls beats it back to the coffin factory and the vags chases down to the Loop to get the last home edition and look at the want ads to see if they's any jobs open with fair pay and nothin' to do. And the soldiers mosey into the garage for a well-earned rest and that leaves Don all alone on the stage.  But he ain't no more than started on his next song when back comes the Michaels girl. It oozes out here that she's in love with the Joss party, but she stalls and pretends like his mother'd sent her to get the receipt for makin' eggs _fo yung_. And she says his mother ast her to kiss him and she slips him a dime, so he leaves her kiss him on the scalp and he asks her if she can stay in town that evenin' and see a nickel show, but they's a important meetin' o' the Maccabees at Janesville that night, so away she goes to catch the two-ten and Don starts in on another song number, but the rest o' the company don't like his stuff and he ain't hardly past the vamp when they's a riot.  It seems like Genevieve and one o' the chorus girls has quarreled over a second-hand stick o' gum and the chorus girl got the gum, but Genevieve relieved her of part of a earlobe, so they pinch Genevieve and leave Joss to watch her till the wagon comes, but the wagon's went out to the night desk sergeant's house with a case o' quarts and before it gets round to pick up Genevieve she's bunked the Chink into settin' her free. So she makes a getaway, tellin' Don to meet her later on at Lily and Pat's place acrost the Indiana line. So that winds up the first act.  Well, the next act's out to Lily and Pat's, and it ain't no Y.M.C.A. headquarters, but it's a hang-out for dips and policemans. They's a cabaret and Genevieve's one o' the performers, but she forgets the words to her first song and winds up with tra-la-la, and she could of forgot the whole song as far as I'm concerned, because it wasn't nothin' you'd want to buy and take along home.  Finally Pat comes in and says it's one o'clock and he's got to close up, but they won't none o' them make a move, and pretty soon they's a live one blows into the joint and he's Eskimo Bill, one o' the butchers out to the Yards. He's got paid that day and he ain't never goin' home. He sings a song and it's the hit o' the show. Then he buys a drink and starts flirtin' with Genevieve, but Pat chases everybody but the performers and a couple o' dips that ain't got nowheres else to sleep. The dips or stick-up guys, or whatever they are, tries to get Genevieve to go along with them in the car w'ile they pull off somethin', but she's still expectin' the Chinaman. So they pass her up and blow, and along comes Don and she lets him in, and it seems like he'd been in jail for two mont's, or ever since the end o' the first act. So he asks her how everything has been goin' down to the pill mill and she tells him that she's quit and became a entertainer. So he says, \"What can you do?\" And she beats time with a pair o' chopsticks and dances the Chinese Blues.  After a w'ile they's a bugle call somewhere outdoors and Don says that means he's got to go back to the garage. So she gets sore and tries to bean him with a Spanish onion. Then he reaches inside his coat and pulls out the bouquet she give him in Atto First to show her he ain't changed his clo'es, and then the sheriff comes in and tries to coax him with a razor to go back to his job. They fight like it was the first time either o' them ever tried it and the sheriff's leadin' on points when Genevieve hollers for the dips, who dashes in with their gats pulled and it's good night, Mister Sheriff! They put him in moth balls and they ask Joss to join their tong. He says all right and they're all pretty well lit by this time and they've reached the singin' stage, and Pat can't get them to go home and he's scared some o' the Hammond people'll put in a complaint, so he has the curtain rang down.  Then they's a relapse of it don't say how long, and Don and Genevieve and the yeggs and their lady friends is all out in the country somewheres attendin' a Bohunk Sokol Verein picnic and Don starts whinin' about his old lady that he'd left up to Janesville.  \"I wisht I was back there,\" he says.  \"You got nothin' on me,\" says Genevieve. \"Only Janesville ain't far enough. I wisht you was back in Hongkong.\"  So w'ile they're flatterin' each other back and forth, a couple o' the girls is monkeyin' with the pasteboards and tellin' their fortunes, and one o' them turns up a two-spot and that's a sign they're goin' to sing a duet. So it comes true and then Genevieve horns into the game and they play three-handed rummy, singin' all the w'ile to bother"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35162"],["title","Gullible's Travels, Etc. (#2)"],["body","other, but finally the fellas that's runnin' the picnic says it's time for the fat man's one-legged race and everybody goes offen the stage. So the Michaels girl comes on and is gettin' by pretty good with a song when she's scared by the noise o' the gun that's fired to start the race for the bay-window championship. So she trips back to her dressin'-room and then Don and Eskimo Bill put on a little slap-stick stuff.  When they first meet they're pals, but as soon as they get wise that the both o' them's bugs over the same girl their relations to'rds each other becomes strange. Here's the talk they spill:  \"Where do you tend bar?\" says Don.  \"You got me guessed wrong,\" says Bill. \"I work out to the Yards.\"  \"Got anything on the hip?\" says Don.  \"You took the words out o' my mouth,\" says Bill. \"I'm drier than St. Petersgrad.\"  \"Stick round a w'ile and maybe we can scare up somethin',\" says Don.  \"I'll stick all right,\" says Bill. \"They's a Jane in your party that's knocked me dead.\"  \"What's her name?\" says Don.  \"Carmen,\" says Bill, Carmen bein' the girl's name in the show that Genevieve was takin' that part.  \"Carmen!\" says Joss. \"Get offen that stuff! I and Carmen's just like two pavin' bricks.\"  \"I should worry!\" says Bill. \"I ain't goin' to run away from no rat-eater.\"  \"You're a rat-eater yourself, you rat-eater!\" says Don.  \"I'll rat-eat you!\" says Bill.  And they go to it with a carvin' set, but they couldn't neither one o' them handle their utensils.  Don may of been all right slicin' toadstools for the suey and Bill prob'ly could of massacreed a flock o' sheep with one stab, but they was all up in the air when it come to stickin' each other. They'd of did it better with dice.  Pretty soon the other actors can't stand it no longer and they come on yellin' \"Fake!\" So Don and Bill fold up their razors and Bill invites the whole bunch to come out and go through the Yards some mornin' and then he beats it, and the Michaels girl ain't did nothin' for fifteen minutes, so the management shoots her out for another song and she sings to Don about how he should ought to go home on account of his old lady bein' sick, so he asks Genevieve if she cares if he goes back to Janesville.  \"Sure, I care,\" says Genevieve. \"Go ahead!\"  So the act winds up with everybody satisfied.  The last act's outside the Yards on the Halsted Street end. Bill's ast the entire company to come in and watch him croak a steer. The scene opens up with the crowd buyin' perfume and smellin' salts from the guys that's got the concessions. Pretty soon Eskimo Bill and Carmen drive in, all dressed up like a horse. Don's came in from Wisconsin and is hidin' in the bunch. He's sore at Carmen for not meetin' him on the Elevated platform.  He lays low till everybody's went inside, only Carmen. Then he braces her. He tells her his old lady's died and left him the laundry, and he wants her to go in with him and do the ironin'.  \"Not me!\" she says.  \"What do you mean--'Not me'?\" says Don.  \"I and Bill's goin' to run a kosher market,\" she says.  Just about now you can hear noises behind the scenes like the cattle's gettin' theirs, so Carmen don't want to miss none of it, so she makes a break for the gate.  \"Where you goin'?\" says Joss.  \"I want to see the butcherin',\" she says.  \"Stick round and I'll show you how it's done,\" says Joss.  So he pulls his knife and makes a pass at her, just foolin'. He misses her as far as from here to Des Moines. But she don't know he's kiddin' and she's scared to death. Yes, sir, she topples over as dead as the Federal League.  It was prob'ly her heart.  So now the whole crowd comes dashin' out because they's been a report that the place is infested with the hoof and mouth disease. They tell Don about it, but he's all excited over Carmen dyin'. He's delirious and gets himself mixed up with a Irish policeman.  \"I yield me prisoner,\" he says.  Then the house doctor says the curtain's got to come down to prevent the epidemic from spreadin' to the audience. So the show's over and the company's quarantined.         *       *       *       *       *  Well, Hatch was out all durin' the second act and part o' the third, and when he finally come back he didn't have to tell nobody where he'd been. And he dozed off the minute he hit his seat. I was for lettin' him sleep so's the rest o' the audience'd think we had one o' the op'ra bass singers in our party. But Mrs. Hatch wasn't lookin' for no publicity, on account of her costume, so she reached over and prodded him with a hatpin every time he begin a new aria.  Goin' out, I says to him:  \"How'd you like it?\"  \"Pretty good,\" he says, \"only they was too much gin in the last one.\"  \"I mean the op'ra,\" I says.  \"Don't ask him!\" says Mrs. Hatch. \"He didn't hear half of it and he didn't understand none of it.\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't say that,\" says I. \"Jim here ain't no boob, and they wasn't nothin' hard about it to understand.\"  \"Not if you know the plot,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"And somethin' about music,\" says my Missus.  \"And got a little knowledge o' French,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"Was that French they was singin'?\" says Hatch. \"I thought it was Wop or ostrich.\"  \"That shows you up,\" says his Frau.  Well, when we got on the car for home they wasn't only one vacant seat and, o' course, Hatch had to have that. So I and my Missus and Mrs. Hatch clubbed together on the straps and I got a earful o' the real dope.  \"What do you think o' Farr'r's costumes?\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"Heavenly!\" says my Missus. \"Specially the one in the second act. It was all colors o' the rainbow.\"  \"Hatch is right in style then,\" I says.  \"And her actin' is perfect,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"Her voice too,\" says the Wife.  \"I liked her actin' better,\" says Mrs. H. \"I thought her voice yodeled in the up-stairs registers.\"  \"What do you suppose killed her?\" I says.  \"She was stabbed by her lover,\" says the Missus.  \"You wasn't lookin',\" I says. \"He never touched her. It was prob'ly tobacco heart.\"  \"He stabs her in the book,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"It never went through the bindin',\" I says.  \"And wasn't Mooratory grand?\" says the Wife.  \"Splendid!\" says Mrs. Hatch. \"His actin' and singin' was both grand.\"  \"I preferred his actin',\" I says. \"I thought his voice hissed in the down-stairs radiators.\"  This give them a good laugh, but they was soon at it again.  \"And how sweet Alda was!\" my Missus remarks.  \"Which was her?\" I ast them.  \"The good girl,\" says Mrs. Hatch. \"The girl that sung that beautiful aria in Atto Three.\"  \"Atto girl!\" I says. \"I liked her too; the little Michaels girl. She came from Janesville.\"  \"She did!\" says Mrs. Hatch. \"How do you know?\"  So I thought I'd kid them along.  \"My uncle told me,\" I says. \"He used to be postmaster up there.\"  \"What uncle was that?\" says my wife.  \"He ain't really my uncle,\" I says. \"We all used to call him our uncle just like all these here singers calls the one o' them Daddy.\"  \"They was a lady in back o' me,\" says Mrs. Hatch, \"that says Daddy didn't appear to-night.\"  \"Prob'ly the Missus' night out,\" I says.  \"How'd you like the Tor'ador?\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"I thought she moaned in the chimney,\" says I.  \"It wasn't no 'she',\" says the Missus. \"We're talkin' about the bull-fighter.\"  \"I didn't see no bull-fight,\" I says.  \"It come off behind the scenes,\" says the Missus.  \"When was you behind the scenes?\" I says.  \"I wasn't never,\" says my Missus. \"But that's where it's supposed to come off.\"  \"Well,\" I says, \"you can take it from me that it wasn't pulled. Do you think the mayor'd stand for that stuff when he won't even leave them stage a box fight? You two girls has got a fine idear o' this here op'ra!\"  \"You know all about it, I guess,\" says the Missus. \"You talk French so good!\"  \"I talk as much French as you do,\" I says. \"But not nowheres near as much English, if you could call it that.\"  That kept her quiet, but Mrs. Hatch buzzed all the way home, and she was scared to death that the motorman wouldn't know where she'd been spendin' the evenin'. And if there was anybody in the car besides me that knowed _Carmen_ it must of been a joke to them hearin' her chatter. It wasn't no joke to me though. Hatch's berth was way off from us and they didn't nobody suspect him o' bein' in our party. I was standin' right up there with her where people couldn't help seein' that we was together.  I didn't want them to think she was my wife. So I kept smilin' at her. And when it finally come time to get off I hollered out loud at Hatch and says:  \"All right, Hatch! Here's our street. Your Missus'll keep you awake the rest o' the way with her liberetto.\"  \"It can't hurt no more than them hatpins,\" he says.  Well, when the paper come the next mornin' my Missus had to grab it up and turn right away to the place where the op'ras is wrote up. Under the article they was a list o' the ladies and gents in the boxes and what they wore, but it didn't say nothin' about what the gents wore, only the ladies. Prob'ly the ladies happened to have the most comical costumes that night, but I bet if the reporters could of saw Hatch they would of gave him a page to himself.  \"Is your name there?\" I says to the Missus.  \"O' course not,\" she says. \"They wasn't none o' them reporters tall enough to see us. You got to set in a box to be mentioned.\"  \"Well,\" I says, \"you don't care nothin' about bein' mentioned, do you?\"  \"O' course not,\" she says; but I could tell from how she said it that she wouldn't run down-town and horsewhip the editor if he made a mistake and printed about she and her costume; her costume wouldn't of et up all the space he had neither.  \"How much does box seats cost?\" I ast her.  \"About six or seven dollars,\" she says.  \"Well,\" I says, \"let's I and you show Hatch up.\"  \"What do you mean?\" she says.  \"I mean we should ought to return the compliment,\" says I. \"We should ought to give them a party right back.\"  \"We'd be broke for six weeks,\" she says.  \"Oh, we'd do it with their money like they done it "]]]
