Measure the longitude of Jupiter on January 1, 1900; on July 1, 1900; on September 25, 1906.  Draw neatly on the map a pencil line connecting the position of the earth for January 1, 1900, with the position of Jupiter for the same date, and produce the line beyond Jupiter until it meets the circle of the constellations. This line represents the direction of Jupiter from the earth, and points toward the constellation in which the planet appears at that date. But this representation of the place of Jupiter in the sky is not a very accurate one, since on the scale of the diagram the stars are in fact more than 100,000 times as far off as they are shown in the figure, and the pencil mark does not meet the line of constellations at the same intersection it would have if this line were pushed back to its true position. To remedy this defect we must draw another line from the sun parallel to the one first drawn, and its intersection with the constellations will give very approximately the true position of Jupiter in the sky.  EXERCISE 15.--Find the present positions of Jupiter and Saturn, and look them up in the sky by means of your star maps. The planets will appear in the indicated constellations as very bright stars not shown on the map.  Which of the planets, Jupiter and Saturn, changes its direction from the sun more rapidly? Which travels the greater number of miles per day? When will Jupiter and Saturn be in the same constellation? Does the earth move faster or slower than Jupiter?  The distance of Jupiter or Saturn from the earth at any time may be readily obtained from the figure. Thus, by direct measurement with the millimeter scale we find for January 1, 1900, the distance of Jupiter from the earth is 6.1 times the distance of the sun from the earth, and this may be turned into miles by multiplying it by 93,000,000, which is approximately the distance of the sun from the earth. For most purposes it is quite as well to dispense with this multiplication and call the distance 6.1 astronomical units, remembering that the astronomical unit is the distance of the sun from the earth.  EXERCISE 16.--What is Jupiter's distance from the earth at its nearest approach? What is the greatest distance it ever attains? Is Jupiter's least distance from the earth greater or less than its least distance from Saturn?  On what day in the year 1906 will the earth be on line between Jupiter and the sun? On this day Jupiter is said to be in _opposition_--i. e., the planet and the sun are on opposite sides of the earth, and Jupiter then comes to the meridian of any and every place at midnight. When the sun is between the earth and Jupiter (at what date in 1906?) the planet is said to be in _conjunction_ with the sun, and of course passes the meridian with the sun at noon. Can you determine from the figure the time at which Jupiter comes to the meridian at other dates than opposition and conjunction? Can you determine when it is visible in the evening hours? Tell from the figure what constellation is on the meridian at midnight on January 1st. Will it be the same constellation in every year?   30. MERCURY, VENUS, AND MARS.--Fig. 17, which represents the orbits of the inner planets, differs from Fig. 16 only in the method of fixing the positions of the planets in their orbits at any given date. The motion of these planets is so rapid, on account of their proximity to the sun, that it would not do to mark their positions as was done for Jupiter and Saturn, and with the exception of the earth they do not always return to the same place on the same day in each year. It is therefore necessary to adopt a slightly different method, as follows: The straight line extending from the sun toward the vernal equinox, _V_, is called the prime radius, and we know from past observations that the earth in its motion around the sun crosses this line on September 23d in each year, and to fix the earth's position for September 23d in the diagram we have only to take the point at which the prime radius intersects the earth's orbit. A month later, on October 23d, the earth will no longer be at this point, but will have moved on along its orbit to the point marked 30 (thirty days after September 23d). Sixty days after September 23d it will be at the point marked 60, etc., and for any date we have only to find the number of days intervening between it and the preceding September 23d, and this number will show at once the position of the earth in its orbit. Thus for the date July 4, 1900, we find      1900, July 4 - 1899, September 23 = 284 days,  and the little circle marked upon the earth's orbit between the numbers 270 and 300 shows the position of the earth on that date.  In what constellation was the sun on July 4, 1900? What zodiacal constellation came to the meridian at midnight on that date? What other constellations came to the meridian at the same time?  The positions of the other planets in their orbits are found in the same manner, save that they do not cross the prime radius on the same date in each year, and the times at which they do cross it must be taken from the following table:                        TABLE OF EPOCHS    -----------------------------------------------------------     A.

The following lines of the table show for each year the date at which each planet first crossed the prime radius in that year; the dates of subsequent crossings in any year can be found by adding once, twice, or three times the period to the given date, and the table may be extended to later years, if need be, by continuously adding multiples of the period. In the case of Mars it appears that there is only about one year out of two in which this planet crosses the prime radius.  After the date at which the planet crosses the prime radius has been determined its position for any required date is found exactly as in the case of the earth, and the constellation in which the planet will appear from the earth is found as explained above in connection with Jupiter and Saturn.  The broken lines in the figure represent the construction for finding the places in the sky occupied by Mercury, Venus, and Mars on July 4, 1900. Let the student make a similar construction and find the positions of these planets at the present time. Look them up in the sky and see if they are where your work puts them.  31. EXERCISES.--The \"evening star\" is a term loosely applied to any planet which is visible in the western sky soon after sunset. It is easy to see that such a planet must be farther toward the east in the sky than is the sun, and in either Fig. 16 or Fig. 17 any planet which viewed from the position of the earth lies to the left of the sun and not more than 50° away from it will be an evening star. If to the right of the sun it is a morning star, and may be seen in the eastern sky shortly before sunrise.  What planet is the evening star _now_? Is there more than one evening star at a time? What is the morning star now?  Do Mercury, Venus, or Mars ever appear in opposition? What is the maximum angular distance from the sun at which Venus can ever be seen? Why is Mercury a more difficult planet to see than Venus? In what month of the year does Mars come nearest to the earth? Will it always be brighter in this month than in any other? Which of all the planets comes nearest to the earth?  The earth always comes to the same longitude on the same day of each year. Why is not this true of the other planets?  The student should remember that in one respect Figs. 16 and 17 are not altogether correct representations, since they show the orbits as all lying in the same plane. If this were strictly true, every planet would move, like the sun, always along the ecliptic; but in fact all of the orbits are tilted a little out of the plane of the ecliptic and every planet in its motion deviates a little from the ecliptic, first to one side then to the other; but not even Mars, which is the most erratic in this respect, ever gets more than eight degrees away from the ecliptic, and for the most part all of them are much closer to the ecliptic than this limit.     CHAPTER IV  CELESTIAL MECHANICS   32. THE BEGINNINGS OF CELESTIAL MECHANICS.--From the earliest dawn of civilization, long before the beginnings of written history, the motions of sun and moon and planets among the stars from constellation to constellation had commanded the attention of thinking men, particularly of the class of priests. The religions of which they were the guardians and teachers stood in closest relations with the movements of the stars, and their own power and influence were increased by a knowledge of them.  [Illustra"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],["title","A Text-Book of Astronomy (#8)"],["body","tion: ISAAC NEWTON (1643-1727).]  Out of these professional needs, as well as from a spirit of scientific research, there grew up and flourished for many centuries a study of the motions of the planets, simple and crude at first, because the observations that could then be made were at best but rough ones, but growing more accurate and more complex as the development of the mechanic arts put better and more precise instruments into the hands of astronomers and enabled them to observe with increasing accuracy the movements of these bodies. It was early seen that while for the most part the planets, including the sun and moon, traveled through the constellations from west to east, some of them sometimes reversed their motion and for a time traveled in the opposite way. This clearly can not be explained by the simple theory which had early been adopted that a planet moves always in the same direction around a circular orbit having the earth at its center, and so it was said to move around in a small circular orbit, called an epicycle, whose center was situated upon and moved along a circular orbit, called the deferent, within which the earth was placed, as is shown in Fig. 18, where the small circle is the epicycle, the large circle is the deferent, _P_ is the planet, and _E_ the earth. When this proved inadequate to account for the really complicated movements of the planets, another epicycle was put on top of the first one, and then another and another, until the supposed system became so complicated that Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, repudiated its fundamental theorem and taught that the motions of the planets take place in circles around the sun instead of about the earth, and that the earth itself is only one of the planets moving around the sun in its own appropriate orbit and itself largely responsible for the seemingly erratic movements of the other planets, since from day to day we see them and observe their positions from different points of view.  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Epicycle and deferent.]  33. KEPLER'S LAWS.--Two generations later came Kepler with his three famous laws of planetary motion:  I. Every planet moves in an ellipse which has the sun at one of its foci.  II. The radius vector of each planet moves over equal areas in equal times.  III. The squares of the periodic times of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.  These laws are the crowning glory, not only of Kepler's career, but of all astronomical discovery from the beginning up to his time, and they well deserve careful study and explanation, although more modern progress has shown that they are only approximately true.  EXERCISE 17.--Drive two pins into a smooth board an inch apart and fasten to them the ends of a string a foot long. Take up the slack of the string with the point of a lead pencil and, keeping the string drawn taut, move the pencil point over the board into every possible position. The curve thus traced will be an ellipse having the pins at the two points which are called its foci.  In the case of the planetary orbits one focus of the ellipse is vacant, and, in accordance with the first law, the center of the sun is at the other focus. In Fig. 17 the dot, inside the orbit of Mercury, which is marked _a_, shows the position of the vacant focus of the orbit of Mars, and the dot _b_ is the vacant focus of Mercury's orbit. The orbits of Venus and the earth are so nearly circular that their vacant foci lie very close to the sun and are not marked in the figure. The line drawn from the sun to any point of the orbit (the string from pin to pencil point) is a _radius vector_. The point midway between the pins is the _center_ of the ellipse, and the distance of either pin from the center measures the _eccentricity_ of the ellipse.  Draw several ellipses with the same length of string, but with the pins at different distances apart, and note that the greater the eccentricity the flatter is the ellipse, but that all of them have the same length.  If both pins were driven into the same hole, what kind of an ellipse would you get?  The Second Law was worked out by Kepler as his answer to a problem suggested by the first law. In Fig. 17 it is apparent from a mere inspection of the orbit of Mercury that this planet travels much faster on one side of its orbit than on the other, the distance covered in ten days between the numbers 10 and 20 being more than fifty per cent greater than that between 50 and 60. The same difference is found, though usually in less degree, for every other planet, and Kepler's problem was to discover a means by which to mark upon the orbit the figures showing the positions of the planet at the end of equal intervals of time. His solution of this problem, contained in the second law, asserts that if we draw radii vectors from the sun to each of the marked points taken at equal time intervals around the orbit, then the area of the sector formed by two adjacent radii vectores and the arc included between them is equal to the area of each and every other such sector, the short radii vectores being spread apart so as to include a long arc between them while the long radii vectores have a short arc. In Kepler's form of stating the law the radius vector is supposed to travel with the planet and in each day to sweep over the same fractional part of the total area of the orbit. The spacing of the numbers in Fig. 17 was done by means of this law.  For the proper understanding of Kepler's Third Law we must note that the \"mean distance\" which appears in it is one half of the long diameter of the orbit and that the \"periodic time\" means the number of days or years required by the planet to make a complete circuit in its orbit. Representing the first of these by _a_ and the second by _T_, we have, as the mathematical equivalent of the law,      a^{3} ÷ T^{2} = C  where the quotient, _C_, is a number which, as Kepler found, is the same for every planet of the solar system. If we take the mean distance of the earth from the sun as the unit of distance, and the year as the unit of time, we shall find by applying the equation to the earth's motion, _C_ = 1. Applying this value to any other planet we shall find in the same units, _a_ = _T_^{2/3}, by means of which we may determine the distance of any planet from the sun when its periodic time, _T_, has been learned from observation.  EXERCISE 18.--Uranus requires 84 years to make a revolution in its orbit. What is its mean distance from the sun? What are the mean distances of Mercury, Venus, and Mars? (See Chapter III for their periodic times.) Would it be possible for two planets at different distances from the sun to move around their orbits in the same time?  A circle is an ellipse in which the two foci have been brought together. Would Kepler's laws hold true for such an orbit?  34. NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION.--Kepler studied and described the motion of the planets. Newton, three generations later (1727 A. D.), studied and described the mechanism which controls that motion. To Kepler and his age the heavens were supernatural, while to Newton and his successors they are a part of Nature, governed by the same laws which obtain upon the earth, and we turn to the ordinary things of everyday life as the foundation of celestial mechanics.  Every one who has ridden a bicycle knows that he can coast farther upon a level road if it is smooth than if it is rough; but however smooth and hard the road may be and however fast the wheel may have been started, it is sooner or later stopped by the resistance which the road and the air offer to its motion, and when once stopped or checked it can be started again only by applying fresh power. We have here a familiar illustration of what is called  THE FIRST LAW OF MOTION.--\"Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line except in so far as it may be compelled by force to change that state.\" A gust of wind, a stone, a careless movement of the rider may turn the bicycle to the right or the left, but unless some disturbing force is applied it will go straight ahead, and if all resistance to its motion could be removed it would go always at the speed given it by the last power applied, swerving neither to the one hand nor the other.  When a slow rider increases his speed we recognize at once that he has applied additional power to the wheel, and when this speed is slackened it equally shows that force has been applied against the motion. It is force alone which can produce a change in either velocity or direction of motion; but simple as this law now appears it required the genius of Galileo to discover it and of Newton to give it the form in which it is stated above.  35. THE SECOND LAW OF MOTION, which is also due to Galileo and Newton, is:  \"Change of motion is proportional to force applied and takes place in the direction of the straight line in which the force acts.\" Suppose a man to fall from a balloon at some great elevation in the air; his own weight is the force which pulls him down, and that force operating at every instant is sufficient to give him at the end of the first second of his fall a downward velocity of 32 feet per second--i. e., it has changed his state from rest, to motion at this rate, and the motion is toward the earth because the force acts in that direction. During the next second the ceaseless operation of this force will have the same effect as in the first second and will add another 32 feet to his velocity, so that two seconds from the time he commenced to fall he will be moving at the rate of 64 feet per second, etc. The column of figures marked _v_ in the table below shows what his velocity will be at the end of subsequent seconds. The changing velocity here shown is the change of motion to which the law refers, and the velocity is proportional to the time shown in the first column of the table, because the amount of force exerted in"]]]
