An examination of the original Hebrew for the use of the word translated \"day\" in Genesis, revealed that it refers more frequently to periods of time of indefinite duration.[A] When this became clear, and the records of the rocks became better known, some theologians suggested, that as we are told that a thousand years are as one day to God, the day of Genesis 1 refers to periods of a thousand years each. This did not strengthen the argument. The best opinion of today, and it is well-nigh universal, is that the Mosaic record refers to indefinite periods of time corresponding to the great divisions of historical geology.  [Footnote A: Compare The Mosaic Record of Creation, A. McCaul, D. D., p. 213.]  Even as late as the sixties and seventies of the last century this question was still so unsettled as to warrant the publication of books defending the Mosaic account of creation.[A]  [Footnote A: For instance Aids to Faith, containing McCaul's most able discussion. The Origin of the World, J. W. Dawson.]  [Sidenote: Joseph Smith's teachings concerning creation found in the Book of Abraham.]  In 1830, certain visions, given to the Jewish lawgiver Moses, were revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. These visions are now incorporated with other matter in the Pearl of Great Price, under the title, The Book of Moses. In chapter two of this book is found an account of the creation, which is nearly identical with the account found in Genesis 1. The slight variations which occur tend only to make the meaning of the writer clearer. In this account, the expression \"and the evening and the morning were the first [etc.] day,\" occurs just as it does in the Mosaic account in the Bible. In 1835, certain ancient records found in the catacombs of Egypt fell into the hands of Joseph Smith, who found them to be some of the writings of Abraham, while he was in Egypt. The translation of these records is also found in the Pearl of Great Price, under the title, The Book of Abraham. In the fourth and fifth chapters of the book is found an account of the creation according to the knowledge of Abraham. The two accounts are essentially the same, but the Abrahamic version is so much fuller and clearer that it illumines the obscurer parts of the Mosaic account. We shall concern ourselves here only with the variation in the use of the word \"day.\"  [Sidenote: The Book of Abraham conveys the idea that the creative periods included much time.]  In Genesis 1:5 we read, \"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the fist day.\" The corresponding period is discussed in the Book of Abraham 4:5 as follows: \"And the Gods called the light Day, and the darkness they called Night. And it came to pass that from the evening until the morning they called night; and from the morning until the evening they called day; _and this was the first, or the beginning, of that which they called night and day.\"_  It is to be noted that in Abraham's version names were given to the intervals between evening and morning, and morning and evening; but absolutely nothing is said about a _first_ day: the statement is simply made, that this was the beginning of the alternating periods of light and darkness which _they,_ the Gods, had named night and day. According to this version, the first creative period occupied an unknown period of time.  In Genesis 1:8 it further says: \"And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\"  The corresponding passage in the Book of Abraham 4:8, reads, \"And the Gods called the expanse Heaven. And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning that they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day, and this was _the second time that they called night and day.\"_  Here it must be noted that nothing is said about a second day. It is said that it was the second time that _they_ called day--which leaves the second creative period entirely indefinite so far as time limits are concerned.  In Genesis 1:13, it reads, \"and the evening and the morning were the third day.\"  In Abraham 4:13, the corresponding passage reads, \"And it came to pass that they numbered the days; from the evening until the morning they called night; and it came to pass, from the morning until the evening they called day; and it was the third time.\"  Here it is explicitly stated that the Gods numbered the days; evidently, they counted the days that had passed during the third creative period, and it was the third time that the numbering had been done. Again, the third creative period is left indefinite, as to time limits.  Gen. 1:19, reads, \"And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\"  Correspondingly, in Abraham 4:19, is found, \"And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning that it was night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that it was day; and it was the fourth time.\"  This quotation from Abraham, standing alone, would be somewhat ambiguous, for it might indicate that it was the fourth time that the periods between evening and morning, and morning and evening were called night and day. In the light of previous passages, however, the meaning of the passage becomes clear. Certainly there is nothing in the verse to confine the fourth creative period within certain time limits.  The fifth day in Genesis closes as does the fourth; and the fifth time in Abraham closes as does the fourth. The remarks made concerning the fourth creative period apply to the fifth.  Concerning the sixth creative period, Gen. 1:31, says, \"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\"  Of the same period Abraham says, \"And the Gods said: We will do everything that we have said, and organize them; and behold, they shall be very obedient. And it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called night; and it came to pass that it was from evening until morning that they called day; and they numbered the sixth time.\"  As in the previous periods, the sixth ended by the Gods numbering the days of the creative period; the sixth period, like those preceding, being indeterminate as to time.  Repeated reading and study of the Abrahamic account, as revealed through Joseph Smith, make it certain beyond doubt that the intent is to convey the idea that the creative periods included much time, and that, at the end of each period, the measure of night and day, was applied to the period, in order that its length might be determined. Whether or not the different creative periods represented days to the mighty beings concerned in the creation, we do not know, and it matters little to the argument of this article.[A]  [Footnote A: The writer understands the creation, reported in Abraham, 4th chapter, to be spiritual in its nature; but he also believes that this spiritual account is a perfect picture of the actual material creation. If chapter 4 of Abraham represents the Gods planning creation, the measuring of time becomes easily understood. It then means, \"How long will it take to accomplish the work?\" All this, however, has no bearing upon the present argument.]  Now, then, we must remember that Joseph Smith made this translation long before the theologians of the world had consented to admit that the Mosaic days meant long periods of time; and long before geology had established beyond question that immense time periods had been consumed in the preparation of the earth for man.  Joseph Smith, the humble, unlearned, despised boy, unfamiliar with books and the theories of men, stated with clear and simple certainty, if his works be read with the eye of candid truth, this fundamental truth of geological science and the Bible, long before the learned of the world had agreed upon the same truth.[A]  [Footnote A: It may be remarked that other geological doctrines were taught by the Prophet, that science has since confirmed. One of these was discussed by Dr. J.E. Talmage in the Improvement Era, Vol. 7, p. 481.]  Standing alone, this fact might be called a chance coincidence, a result of blind fate. But recalling that it is one of many similar and even more striking facts, what shall be said, Has ever impostor dared what Joseph Smith did? Has ever false prophet lived beyond his generation, if his prophecies were examined? Shall we of this foremost age accept convincing, logical truth, though it run counter to our preconceived notions? Glorious were the visions of Joseph the Prophet; unspeakable would be our joy, should they be given to us.     Chapter VIII.  ORGANIZED INTELLIGENCE.   [Sidenote: A complete philosophy must consider living beings.]  The student of the constitution of the universe must take into account living beings. Plants, animals and men are essentially different from the mass of matter. The rock, apparently, is the same forever; but the plant has a beginning, and after a comparatively short existence dies. Animals and men, likewise, begin their earthly existence; then, after a brief life, die, or disappear from the immediate knowledge of living things.  Man, the highest type of living things, differs from the rock, moreover, in that he possesses the power to exercise his will in directing natural forces. Animals and even plants seem to possess a similar power to a smaller degree. The rock on the hillside is pulled downward by gravitation, but "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34371"],["title","Pliocene and Pleistocene Records of Fossil Turtles from Western Kansas and (#0)"],["body","and Pleistocene Records of Fossil Turtles from Western Kansas and Oklahoma  BY  EDWIN C.

GALBREATH   In the vertebrate paleontological collection at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History there are many fragments of turtles that have been collected, generally in connection with the  excavation or recovery of other fossils. The generic identification of this material is possible in many instances, and such identifications give new and important geological and distributional records for genera in existence today.  All catalogue numbers refer to the vertebrate paleontological collection in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.   Family KINOSTERNIDAE  +Kinosternon+ sp. No. 7729 consists of fragments of marginals, costals, and plastronal elements collected from Edson Quarry, Sherman County, Kansas. The age is middle Pliocene (Hemphillian). No. 7679, consisting of a nuchal, and fragments of marginals, costals, and neurals is from Nye Sink, XI Ranch, Meade County, Kansas, and is of Pleistocene age.  Any fossil record of _Kinosternon_ is a welcome find, and these two specimens give new data both as to age and distribution. However, it should be emphasized that these identifications are based on fragments, and are tentative.   Family EMYDIDAE  +Pseudemys+ sp. No. 5613, Sherman County; 6784, Seward County; and 4728, Meade County, are three of many fragments, mainly elements of the nuchal plate and plastron, that were collected from Edson Quarry, Sherman County, Kansas, and from middle and late Pliocene beds in Seward and Meade counties, Kansas, respectively. The species represented cannot be differentiated from species of _Pseudemys_ living today. Species of _Pseudemys_ are common also in most of the Pleistocene deposits of western Kansas.   Family TESTUDINIDAE  +Testudo+ sp. In general, two recognizable lines of the genus _Testudo_ existed in western Kansas during early Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene time--a line of large testudinates with a carapace three to four feet long, and one line of smaller tortoises with a rugose carapace approximately six to nine inches in diameter. Hibbard's _Testudo riggsi_ (Hibbard, 1944) is the best known of these smaller turtles.  +Gopherus+ sp. No. 5935 is from the Pleistocene of Harper County, Kansas, and No. 7677 is from the early Pleistocene of Beaver County, Oklahoma. Each is composed of costals and neurals which may be referred to this genus. Their size indicates an animal considerably larger than any on record, and probably these specimens represent a new species.   Family CHELYDRIDAE  +Chelydra+ sp. No. 6821 is the anterior part of a plastron from the Edson Quarry, Sherman County, Kansas. The age is middle Pliocene. This fragment has been listed three times in print, once merely as Chelonia (having reference to the order) (Adams and Martin, 1931), and twice by Hibbard (1934 and 1939) as _Chelonia_ sp. Hibbard's listing was obviously a _lapsus calami_ for _Chelydra_ since he placed the genus in the family Chelydridae.  No. 6479 is part of a costal and marginals from Meade County, Kansas. This specimen was associated with _Aenocyon dirus_, and is Pleistocene in age.   Family TRIONYCHIDAE  +Amyda+ sp. No. 6800 is part of a costal collected in Seward County, Kansas. It is possibly of early Pleistocene age. No. 7568 is part of a carapace from Meade County, Kansas, probably of the same age.     LITERATURE CITED    ADAMS, L. A., and MARTIN, H. T.    1931.
