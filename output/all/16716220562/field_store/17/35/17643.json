RAYMOND HALL and BERNARDO VILLA R.   A series of 17 pocket gophers of the species _Thomomys umbrinus_ obtained in 1943 from points 3, 4 and 5 miles south of Pátzcuaro proves upon comparison to be an hitherto unrecognized subspecies which is described and named as follows:                #Thomomys umbrinus pullus#, new subspecies      _Type._--Male, adult, skin and skull; No. 100151, Univ.     California Mus. Vert. Zool.; 5 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7800 ft.,     Michoacán, Mexico; March 10, 1943; obtained by Hubert H. Hall,     original No. 117.      _Range._--Known only from 3 to 5 miles south of Pátzcuaro,     Michoacán.      _Diagnosis._--Size small (see measurements); color black or     between Cinnamon-Brown and Snuff Brown; distal half of tail     whitish and all of tail whitish in one specimen; lambdoidal     crests perpendicular to sagittal plane of skull; posteroventral     face of tympanic bulla rugose; jugal vertical (flat surface not     oblique); interpterygoid space truncate at apex with sides     curved outward (see figure).      _Comparison._--From topotypes of _Thomomys umbrinus supernus_     Nelson and Goldman, _pullus_ differs as follows: More     individuals wholly black (except distal half of tail);     underparts lacking white; rostrum broader; braincase anteriorly     slightly more expanded dorsally; lambdoidal crests perpendicular     to sagittal plane rather than inclined posteromediad;     interparietal broader, [Male] 5.7 (5.0-7.0) versus 4.5, and in     [Female] 6.5 (5.6-7.1) rather than 4.8 (4.4-5.1); flattened     middle part of jugal vertical rather than oblique; in side view,     mastoid and paroccipital processes farther apart thus exposing     larger surface of mastoidal bulla; incisors, in both upper and     lower jaws, slightly narrower; molariform teeth smaller,     interpterygoid space truncate, at apex, with sides convex     mediad, rather than V-shaped; ventral face of tympanic bullae     rugose in posterior half rather than smooth.  [Illustration: FIGS. 1-3. Three views of the skull of the type specimen of _Thomomys umbrinus pullus_. × 1.]  _Remarks._--Among named subspecies of _Thomomys umbrinus_, _T. u. pullus_ most closely resembles _T. u. supernus_, the subspecies next adjacent to the northward. Therefore, the results of comparisons with only that subspecies are here reported upon. _T. u. tolucae_ to the eastward is for one thing a much larger animal and has slightly less procumbent upper incisors. So far as we know, _Thomomys umbrinus_ has not heretofore been reported from Michoacán. Of our seventeen skins, eight are brown, six are black and two are intermediate in color.  Most of these pocket gophers lived where there was a good growth of pine trees in the same areas where large pocket gophers of the species _Cratogeomys gymnurus_ occurred. The field notes of the collector of the type of _T. u. pullus_ record that when he was making a shallow excavation to reveal the gopher burrow in which he trapped the holotype, he found the burrow approximately five inches below the surface of the ground and that in digging deeper than was necessary he accidentally broke into the burrow of a _Cratogeomys_. Another member of our field party (E. R. Hall) when removing from its burrow a trapped _Thomomys_ that was caught only by the hind leg, dug around the animal whose burrow was approximately six inches underground and in doing so he also broke through the roof of a burrow of _Cratogeomys_. The burrow of _Cratogeomys_ was approximately sixteen inches below the ground. Nowhere else, except 3 to 5 miles south of Pátzcuaro, have the authors found two kinds of pocket gophers living together. The two-story arrangement south of Pátzcuaro was possible because of the different levels at which the two kinds of animals made their burrows and the two-story arrangement was accidental and exceptional rather than the rule.      _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of five adults     of each sex, are as follows: Total length, male 184 (178-198),     female 185 (174-194); length of tail, 54 (48-60), 53 (47-57);     length of hind foot, 26.8 (25-29), 27.6 (26-29); weight, 86.1     (78.7-96.9), 74.3 (70.2-84.8) grams; basilar length, 30.2     (28.8-31.3), 28.6 (27.8-29.1); zygomatic breadth, 23.2     (22.3-24.6), 21.3 (20.8-21.8); least interorbital breadth, 5.9     (5.8-6.1), 6.4 (6.0-6.8); mastoid breadth, 17.8 (17.1-18.7),     17.2 (16.6-17.5); length of nasals, 12.4 (11.8-13.0), 11.5     (11.0-12.5); breadth of rostrum, 7.5 (6.9-8.2), 7.1 (6.9-7.3);     length of rostrum, 14.1 (13.4-14.5), 13.3 (12.7-13.5); alveolar     length of maxillary tooth-row, 7.0 (6.7-7.5), 6.9 (6.8-7.0);     palato-frontal depth, 13.2 (13.0-13.4), 12.9 (12.3-13.5).      _Specimens examined._--Total, 17, all from 7800 ft., Michoacán,     as follows: 3 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 1; 4 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 10; 5 mi. S     Pátzcuaro, 6.         *       *       *       *       *  In 1943 a series of fifteen spiny pocket mice, _Liomys irroratus_, was obtained within a radius of five miles of Pátzcuaro and, mostly on geographic considerations, the animals were assigned to _Liomys irroratus alleni_ (Coues). In fact, in his \"Revision of the Spiny Pocket Mice,\" Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 34:57, 1911) had thus identified the one specimen available to him from Pátzcuaro. Critical examination of the series, however, revealed cranial features not described in the named kinds from adjoining geographic areas, and comparisons showed that the animal from Pátzcuaro differs subspecifically from any named kind. The new subspecies may be known as:                #Liomys irroratus acutus#, new subspecies      _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 100171, Univ.     California Mus. Vert. Zool.; 2 mi. W. Pátzcuaro, 7700 ft.,     Michoacán, Mexico; March 10, 1943; obtained by E. R. Hall and J.     R. Alcorn, original No. 3837 of Alcorn.      _Range._--Known only from the vicinity of Pátzcuaro, Michoacán.      _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); upper parts dark     brown; posterior border of nasals V-shaped with apex directed     anteriorly; frontomaxillary suture medially concave or rarely     straight; interparietal subcircular; basisphenoid wide; tympanic     bullae large.      _Comparisons._--From _Liomys irroratus alleni_, _acutus_ differs     as follows: Color slightly darker brown on upper parts; size     slightly less; posterior border of nasals V-shaped rather than     truncate; frontomaxillary suture medially concave or straight     instead of convex; interparietal subcircular (anterior border)     rather than triangular; basisphenoid broader; tympanic bullae     larger and more inflated. From _Liomys irroratus jaliscensis_     (topotypes), _acutus_ differs as follows: Color slightly darker     brown on upper parts; size larger, without overlap, in external     measurements and in basilar length, length of nasals and mastoid     breadth; posterior border of nasals V-shaped rather than almost     truncate; frontomaxillary suture medially concave or straight     rather than convex; interparietal subcircular rather than     quadrilateral; basisphenoid wider; tympanic bullae larger. From     _Liomys irroratus pullus_, _acutus_ differs in longer body,     shorter tail, slightly longer hind foot; all of upper parts, and     especially upper side of tail, more brownish and less blackish;     posterior border of nasals and frontomaxillary suture differing     in same way as from _alleni_; interorbital region narrower in     relation to length of skull; over-all length of skull greater;     interparietal anteroposteriorly longer; tympanic bullae more     inflated.  [Illustration: FIGS. 4-6. Three views of the skull of the type specimen of _Liomys irroratus acutus_. × 1.]  _Remarks._--This relatively large, dark-colored, spiny pocket mouse of east-central Michoacán differs from its geographic neighbors in V-shape of posterior border of nasals, semicircular shape of interparietal, medially concave maxillofrontal suture, wide basisphenoid and larger tympanic bullae. The latter character is not constant. Intergradation with _L. i. alleni_ is shown by specimens from Querendaro in which the shape of the interparietal is exactly intermediate between those of topotypes of the two subspecies and also in that the basisphenoid is wider than in _acutus_ but narrower than in _alleni_. Intergradation with _L. i. jaliscensis_ is shown, by specimen No. 120275 (U. S. N. M.) from Zamora, in shape of posterior end of nasals, direction of maxillofrontal suture, and shape of interparietal. In each of these features the specimen from Zamora is almost exactly"]]]
