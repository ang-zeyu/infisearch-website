So we ast them over the followin' night and it looked for a minute like we was goin' to clean up. But after that one minute my Missus began collectin' pitcher cards again and every card Hatch drawed seemed like it was made to his measure. Well, sir, when we was through the lucky stiff was eight dollars to the good and Mrs. Hatch had about broke even.  \"Do you suppose you can get them same seats?\" I says.  \"What seats?\" says Hatch.  \"For the op'ra,\" I says.  \"You won't get me to no more op'ra,\" says Hatch. \"I don't never go to the same show twicet.\"  \"It ain't the same show, you goof!\" I says. \"They change the bill every day.\"  \"They ain't goin' to change this eight-dollar bill o' mine,\" he says.  \"You're a fine stiff!\" I says.  \"Call me anything you want to,\" says Hatch, \"as long as you don't go over eight bucks' worth.\"  \"Jim don't enjoy op'ra,\" says Mrs. Hatch.  \"He don't enjoy nothin' that's more than a nickel,\" I says. \"But as long as he's goin' to welsh on us I hope he lavishes the eight-spot where it'll do him some good.\"  \"I'll do what I want to with it,\" says Hatch.  \"Sure you will!\" I says. \"You'll bury it. But what you should ought to do is buy two suits o' clo'es.\"  So I went out in the kitchen and split a pint one way.  But don't think for a minute that I and the Missus ain't goin' to hear no more op'ra just because of a cheap stiff like him welshin'. I don't have to win in no rummy game before I spend.  We're goin' next Tuesday night, I and the Missus, and we're goin' to set somewheres near Congress Street. The show's _Armour's Do Re Me_, a new one that's bein' gave for the first time. It's prob'ly named after some soap.     THREE KINGS AND A PAIR   Accordin' to some authorities, a person, before they get married, should ought to look up your opponent's family tree and find out what all her relatives died of. But the way I got it figured out, if you're sure they did die, the rest of it don't make no difference. In exceptionable cases it may be all right to take a girl that part of her family is still livin', but not under no circumstances if the part happens to be a unmarried sister named Bessie.  We was expectin' her in about two weeks, but we got a card Saturday mornin' which she says on it that she'd come right away if it was all the same to us, because it was the dull season in Wabash society and she could tear loose better at the present time than later on. Well, I guess they ain't no time in the year when society in Wabash would collapse for she not bein' there, but if she had to come at all, the sooner it was over the better. And besides, it wouldn't of did us no good to say aye, yes or no, because the postcard only beat her here by a few hours.  Not havin' no idear she was comin' so soon I didn't meet the train, but it seems like she brought her escort right along with her. It was a guy named Bishop and she'd met him on the trip up. The news butcher introduced them, I guess. He seen her safe to the house and she was there when I got home. Her and my Missus was full of him.  \"Just think!\" the Missus says. \"He writes motion-pitcher plays.\"  \"And gets ten thousand a year,\" says Bess.  \"Did you find out from the firm?\" I ast her.  \"He told me himself,\" says Bessie.  \"That's the right kind o' fella,\" says I, \"open and above the board.\"  \"Oh, you'll like Mr. Bishop,\" says Bess. \"He says such funny things.\"  \"Yes,\" I says, \"that's a pretty good one about the ten thousand a year. But I suppose it's funnier when he tells it himself. I wisht I could meet him.\"  \"They won't be no trouble about that,\" says the Missus. \"He's comin' to dinner to-morrow and he's comin' to play cards some evenin' next week.\"  \"What evenin'?\" I says.  \"Any evenin' that's convenient for you,\" says Bessie.  \"Well,\" I says, \"I'm sorry, but I got engagements every night except Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\"  \"What about Tuesday?\" ast Bessie.  \"We're goin' to the op'ra,\" I says.  \"Oh, won't that be grand!\" says Bessie. \"I wonder what I can wear.\"  \"A kimono'll be all right,\" I says. \"If the door-bell rings, you don't have to answer it.\"  \"What do you mean?\" says the Missus. \"I guess if we go, Bess'll go with us.\"  \"You'd starve to death if you guessed for a livin',\" I says.  \"Never mind that kind o' talk,\" says the Missus. \"When we got a visitor we're not goin' out places nights and leave her here alone.\"  \"What's the matter with Bishop?\" I says. \"They's lots o' two-handed card games.\"  \"I ain't goin' to force myself on to you,\" says Bessie. \"You don't have to take me nowheres if you don't want to.\"  \"I wisht you'd put that in writin' in case of a lawsuit,\" I says.  \"Listen here,\" says the Frau. \"Get this straight: Either Bess goes or I don't go.\"  \"You can both stay home,\" says I. \"I don't anticipate no trouble findin' a partner.\"  \"All right, that's settled,\" says the Missus. \"We'll have a party of our own.\"  And it must of been goin' to be a dandy, because just speakin' about it made her cry. So I says:  \"You win! But I'll prob'ly have to change the tickets.\"  \"What kind o' tickets have you got?\" ast the Missus.  \"Cheap ones,\" I says. \"Down-stairs, five per.\"  \"How grand!\" says Bessie.  \"Yes,\" I says, \"but I'm afraid I got the last two they had. I'll prob'ly have to give them back and take three balcony seats.\"  \"That's all right, just so's Bess goes,\" says the Wife.  \"Mr. Bishop's wild about music,\" says Bessie.  \"Well,\" I says, \"he prob'ly gets passes to the pitcher houses.\"  \"He don't hear no real music there,\" says Bessie.  \"Well,\" says I, \"suppose when he comes to-morrow, I mention somethin' about I and the Missus havin' tickets to the op'ra Tuesday night. Then, if he's so wild about music, he'll maybe try to horn into the party and split the expenses fifty-fifty.\"  \"That'd be a fine thing!\" says the Frau. \"He'd think we was a bunch o' cheap skates. Come right out and ask him to go at your expense, or else don't ask him at all.\"  \"I won't ask him at all,\" I says. \"It was a mistake for me to ever suggest it.\"  \"Yes,\" says Bessie, \"but after makin' the suggestion it would be a mean trick to not go through with it.\"  \"Why?\" I ast her. \"He won't never know the difference.\"  \"But I will,\" says Bessie.  \"Course you would, dear,\" says the Missus. \"After thinkin' you was goin' to have a man of your own, the party wouldn't seem like no party if you just went along with us.\"  \"All right, all right,\" I says. \"Let's not argue no more. Every time I open my head it costs three dollars.\"  \"No such a thing,\" says the Missus. \"The whole business won't only be two dollars more than you figured on. The tickets you had for the two of us would come to ten dollars, and with Bess and Mr. Bishop goin' it's only twelve, if you get balcony seats.\"  \"I wonder,\" says Bessie, \"if Mr. Bishop wouldn't object to settin' in the balcony.\"  \"Maybe he would,\" says the Missus.  \"Well,\" I says, \"if he gets dizzy and falls over the railin' they's plenty of ushers to point out where he come from.\"  \"They ain't no danger of him gettin' dizzy,\" says Bessie. \"The only thing is that he's prob'ly used to settin' in the high-priced seats and would be embarrassed amongst the riff and raff.\"  \"He can wear a false mustache for a disguise.\"  \"He's got a real one,\" says Bessie.  \"He can shave it off, then,\" says I.  \"I wouldn't have him do that for the world,\" says Bessie. \"It's too nice a one.\"  \"You can't judge a mustache by seein' it oncet,\" I says. \"It may be a crook at heart.\"  \"This ain't gettin' us nowheres,\" says the Missus. \"They's still a question before the house.\"  \"It's up to Bess to give the answer,\" I says. \"Bishop and his lip shield are invited if they'll set in a three-dollar seat.\"  \"It's off, then,\" says Bessie, and beats it in the guest room and slams the door.  \"What's the matter with you?\" says the Missus.  \"Nothin' at all,\" I says, \"except that I ain't no millionaire scenario writer. Twenty dollars is twenty dollars.\"  \"Yes,\" the Missus says, \"but how many times have you lost more than that playin' cards and not thought nothin' of it?\"  \"That's different,\" I says. \"When I spend money in a card game it's more like a investment. I got a chance to make somethin' by it.\"  \"And this would be a investment, too,\" says the Wife, \"and a whole lot better chance o' winnin' than in one o' them crooked card games.\"  \"What are you gettin' at?\" I ast her.  \"This is what I'm gettin' at,\" she says, \"though you'd ought to see it without me tellin' you. This here Bishop's made a big hit with Bess.\"  \"It's been done before,\" says I.  \"Listen to me,\" says the Frau. \"It's high time she was gettin' married, and I don't want her marryin' none o' them Hoosier hicks.\"  \"They'll see to that,\" I says. \"They ain't such hicks.\"  \"She could do a lot worse than take this here Bishop,\" the Missus says. \"Ten"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35162"],["title","Gullible's Travels, Etc. (#4)"],["body"," thousand a year ain't no small change. And she'd be here in Chi; maybe they could find a flat right in this buildin'.\"  \"That's all right,\" I says. \"We could move.\"  \"Don't be so smart,\" says the Missus. \"It would be mighty nice for me to have her so near and it would be nice for you and I both to have a rich brother-in-law.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" says I. \"Somebody might do us a mischief in a fit o' jealous rage.\"  \"He'd show us enough good times to make up for whatever they done,\" says the Wife. \"We're foolish if we don't make no play for him and it'd be startin' off right to take him along to this here op'ra and set him in the best seats. He likes good music and you can see he's used to doin' things in style. And besides, sis looks her best when she's dressed up.\"  Well, I finally give in and the Missus called Bessie out o' the despondents' ward and they was all smiles and pep, but they acted like I wasn't in the house; so, to make it realistical, I blowed down to Andy's and looked after some o' my other investments.         *       *       *       *       *  We always have dinner Sundays at one o'clock, but o' course Bishop didn't know that and showed up prompt at ten bells, before I was half-way through the comical section. I had to go to the door because the Missus don't never put on her shoes till she's positive the family on the first floor is all awake, and Bessie was baskin' in the kind o' water that don't come in your lease at Wabash.  \"Mr. Bishop, ain't it?\" I says, lookin' him straight in the upper lip.  \"How'd you know?\" he says, smilin'.  \"The girls told me to be expectin' a handsome man o' that name,\" I says. \"And they told me about the mustache.\"  \"Wouldn't be much to tell,\" says Bishop.  \"It's young yet,\" I says. \"Come in and take a weight off your feet.\"  So he picked out the only chair we got that ain't upholstered with flatirons and we set down and was tryin' to think o' somethin' more to say when Bessie hollered to us from mid-channel.  \"Is that Mr. Bishop?\" she yelped.  \"It's me, Miss Gorton,\" says Bishop.  \"I'll be right out,\" says Bess.  \"Take it easy,\" I says. \"You mightn't catch cold, but they's no use riskin' it.\"  So then I and Bishop knocked the street-car service and President Wilson and give each other the double O. He wasn't what you could call ugly lookin', but if you'd come out in print and say he was handsome, a good lawyer'd have you at his mercy. His dimensions, what they was of them, all run perpendicular. He didn't have no latitude. If his collar slipped over his shoulders he could step out of it. If they hadn't been payin' him all them millions for pitcher plays, he could of got a job in a wire wheel. They wouldn't of been no difference in his photograph if you took it with a X-ray or a camera. But he had hair and two eyes and a mouth and all the rest of it, and his clo'es was certainly class. Why wouldn't they be? He could pick out cloth that was thirty bucks a yard and get a suit and overcoat for fifteen bucks. A umbrella cover would of made him a year's pyjamas.  Well, I seen the Missus sneak from the kitchen to her room to don the shoe leather, so I got right down to business.  \"The girls tells me you're fond o' good music,\" I says.  \"I love it,\" says Bishop.  \"Do you ever take in the op'ra?\" I ast him.  \"I eat it up,\" he says.  \"Have you been this year?\" I says.  \"Pretty near every night,\" says Bishop.  \"I should think you'd be sick of it,\" says I.  \"Oh, no,\" he says, \"no more'n I get tired o' food.\"  \"A man could easy get tired o' the same kind o' food,\" I says.  \"But the op'ras is all different,\" says Bishop.  \"Different languages, maybe,\" I says. \"But they're all music and singin'.\"  \"Yes,\" says Bishop, \"but the music and singin' in the different op'ras is no more alike than lumbago and hives. They couldn't be nothin' differenter, for instance, than _Faust_ and _Madame Buttermilk_.\"  \"Unlest it was Scotch and chocolate soda,\" I says.  \"They's good op'ras and bad op'ras,\" says Bishop.  \"Which is the good ones?\" I ast him.  \"Oh,\" he says, \"_Carmen_ and _La Bohemian Girl_ and _Ill Toreador_.\"  \"_Carmen's_ a bear cat,\" I says. \"If they was all as good as _Carmen_, I'd go every night. But lots o' them is flivvers. They say they couldn't nothin' be worse than this _Armour's Dee Tree Ree_.\"  \"It is pretty bad,\" says Bishop. \"I seen it a year ago.\"  Well, I'd just been readin' in the paper where it was bran'-new and hadn't never been gave prev'ous to this season. So I thought I'd have a little sport with Mr. Smartenstein.  \"What's it about?\" I says.  He stalled a w'ile.  \"It ain't about much of anything,\" he says.  \"It must be about somethin',\" says I.  \"They got it all balled up the night I seen it,\" says Bishop. \"The actors forgot their lines and a man couldn't make heads or tails of it.\"  \"Did they sing in English?\" I ast him.  \"No; Latin,\" says Bishop.  \"Can you understand Latin?\" I says.  \"Sure,\" says he. \"I'd ought to. I studied it two years.\"  \"What's the name of it mean in English?\" I ast.  \"You pronounce the Latin wrong,\" he says. \"I can't parse it from how you say it. If I seen it wrote out I could tell.\"  So I handed him the paper where they give the op'ra schedule.  \"That's her,\" I says, pointin' to the one that was billed for Tuesday night.  \"Oh, yes,\" says Bishop. \"Yes, that's the one.\"  \"No question about that,\" says I. \"But what does it mean?\"  \"I knowed you said it wrong,\" says Bishop. \"The right pronouncement would be: _L. Armour's Day Trey Ray_. No wonder I was puzzled.\"  \"Now the puzzle's solved,\" I says. \"What do them last three words mean? Louie Armour's what?\"  \"It ain't nothin' to do with Armour,\" says Bishop. \"The first word is the Latin for love. And _Day_ means of God, and _Trey_ means three, and _Ray_ means Kings.\"  \"Oh,\" I says, \"it's a poker game. The fella's just called and the other fella shows down his hand and the first fella had a straight and thought it wasn't no good. So he's su'prised to see what the other fella's got. So he says: 'Well, for the love o' Mike, three kings!' Only he makes it stronger. Is that the dope?\"  \"I don't think it's anything about poker,\" says Bishop.  \"You'd ought to know,\" I says. \"You seen it.\"  \"But it was all jumbled up,\" says Bishop. \"I couldn't get the plot.\"  \"Do you suppose you could get it if you seen it again?\" I says.  \"I wouldn't set through it,\" he says. \"It's no good.\"  Well, sir, I thought at the time that that little speech meant a savin' of eight dollars, because if he didn't go along, us three could set amongst the riff and raff. I dropped the subject right there and was goin' to tell the girls about it when he'd went home. But the Missus crabbed it a few minutes after her and Bess come in the room.  \"Did you get your invitation?\" says she to Bishop.  \"What invitation?\" he says.  \"My husban' was goin' to ask you to go with us Tuesday night,\" she says. \"Grand op'ra.\"  \"Bishop won't go,\" I says. \"He's already saw the play and says it ain't no good and he wouldn't feel like settin' through it again.\"  \"Why, Mr. Bishop! That's a terrible disappointment,\" says the Missus.  \"We was countin' on you,\" says Bessie, chokin' up.  \"It's tough luck,\" I says, \"but you can't expect things to break right all the w'ile.\"  \"Wouldn't you change your mind?\" says the Missus.  \"That's up to your husban',\" says Bishop. \"I didn't understand that I was invited. I should certainly hate to break up a party, and if I'd knew I was goin' to be ast I would of spoke different about the op'ra. It's prob'ly a whole lot better than when I seen it. And, besides, I surely would enjoy your company.\"  \"You can enjoy ourn most any night for nothin',\" I says. \"But if you don't enjoy the one down to the Auditorium, they's no use o' me payin' five iron men to have you bored to death.\"  \"You got me wrong,\" says Bishop. \"The piece was gave by a bunch o' supers the time I went. I'd like to see it with a real cast. They say it's a whiz when it's acted right.\"  \"There!\" says the Missus. \"That settles it. You can change the tickets to-morrow.\"  So I was stopped and they wasn't no more to say, and after a w'ile we had dinner and then I seen why Bishop was so skinny. 'Parently he hadn't tasted fodder before for a couple o' mont's.  \"It must keep you busy writin' them scenarios,\" I says. \"No time to eat or nothin'.\"  \"Oh, I eat oncet in a w'ile even if I don't look it,\" he says. \"I don't often get a chance at food that's cooked like this. Your wife's some dandy little cook!\"  \"It runs in the family, I guess,\" says Bessie. \"You'd ought to taste my cookin'.\"  \"Maybe he will some day,\" says the Missus, and then her and Bessie pretended like they'd made a break and was embarrassed.  So when he was through I says:  \"Leave Bess take Bishop out in the kitchen and show him how she can wash dishes.\"  \"Nothin' doin',\" says the Wife. \"I'm goin' to stack them and then I and you's got to hurry and keep our date.\"  \"What date?\" I says.  \"Over to Hatch's,\" says the Missus. \"You hadn't forgotten, had you?\"  \"I hadn't forgot that the Hatches was in Benton Harbor,\" I says.  \"Yes,\" says the Frau, winkin' at me, \"but I promised Mrs. Hatch I'd run over there and see that everything was O. K.\"  So I wasn't even allowed to set down and smoke, but had to help unload the table and then go out in the cold. And it was rotten weather and Sunday and nothin' but water, water everywhere.  \"What's the idear?\" I ast the Missus when we was out.  \"Can't you see nothin'?\" she says. \"I want to give Bess a chance.\"  \"Chance to what?\" I says.  \"A chance to talk to him,\" says the Wife.  \"Oh!\" says I. \"I thought you wanted him to get stuck on her.\"  \"What do you think of him?\" says she. \"Wouldn't he fit fine in the family?\"  \"He'd fit in a flute,\" I says. \"He's the skinniest thing I ever seen. It seems like a shame to pay five dollars for a seat for him when him and Bessie could sit in the same seat without contact.\"  \"He is slender,\" says the Missus. \"Prob'ly they been"]]]
