THE RESPONSIBLE CUCKOO  THE RESPONSIBLE CUCKOO   High on the kitchen wall of an old farm-house on a mountain-side in Switzerland there hangs a tiny wooden clock. In the tiny wooden clock there lives a tiny wooden cuckoo, and every hour he hops out of his tiny wooden door, takes a look about to see what is going on in the world, shouts out the time of day, and pops back again into his little dark house, there to wait and tick away the minutes until it is time once more to tell the hour.  Late one spring afternoon, just as the sun was sinking out of sight, lighting up the snow-capped mountains with beautiful colors and sending long shafts of golden light across the valleys, the cuckoo woke with a start.  \"Bless me!\" he said to himself, \"Here it is six o'clock and not a sound in the kitchen! It's high time for Mother Adolf to be getting supper. What in the world this family would do without me I really cannot think! They'd never know it was supper time if I didn't tell them, and would starve to death as likely as not. It is lucky for them I am such a responsible bird.\" The tiny wooden door flew open and he stuck out his tiny wooden head. There was not a sound in the kitchen but the loud ticking of the clock.  \"Just as I thought,\" said the cuckoo. \"Not a soul here.\"  There stood the table against the kitchen wall, with a little gray mouse on it nibbling a crumb of cheese. Along finger of sunlight streamed through the western window and touched the great stone stove, as if trying to waken the fire within. A beam fell upon a pan of water standing on the floor and sent gay sparkles of light dancing over the shining tins in the cupboard. The cuckoo saw it all at a glance. \"This will never do,\" he ticked indignantly. There was a queer rumbling sound in his insides as if his feelings were getting quite too much for him, and then suddenly he sent a loud \"cuckoo\" ringing through the silent room. Instantly the little gray mouse leaped down from the table and scampered away to his hole in the wall, the golden sunbeam flickered and was gone, and shadows began to creep into the corners. \"Cuckoo, cuckoo,\" he shouted at the top of his voice, \"cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo,\"--six times in all,--and then, his duty done, he popped back again into his little dark house, and the door clicked behind him.  Out in the garden Mother Adolf heard him and, raising her head from the onion-bed, where she was pulling weeds, she counted on her fingers, \"One, two, three, four, five, six! Bless my soul, six o'clock and the sun already out of sight behind old Pilatus,\" she said, and, rising from her knees a little stiffly, she stood for a moment looking down the green slopes toward the valley.  Far, far below, the blue waters of Lake Lucerne mirrored the glowing colors of the mountain-peaks beyond its farther shore, and nearer, among the foothills of old Pilatus itself, a little village nestled among green trees, its roofs clustered about a white church-spire. Now the bells in the steeple began to ring, and the sound floated out across the green fields spangled with yellow daffodils, and reached Mother Adolf where she stood. Bells from more distant villages soon joined in the clamor, until all the air was filled with music and a hundred echoes woke in the mountains.  The tiny wooden cuckoo heard them and ticked loudly with satisfaction. \"Everybody follows me,\" he said to himself proudly. \"I wake all the bells in the world.\"  \"Where can the children be?\" said Mother Adolf aloud to herself, looking about the garden. \"I haven't heard a sound from either the baby or the Twins for over an hour,\" and, making a hollow between her lands, she added her own bit of music to the chorus of the hills.  (line of music notation)  she sang, and immediately from behind the willows which fringed the brook at the end of the garden two childish voices gave back an answering strain.  (line of music notation)  A moment later two sunburned, towheaded, blue-eyed children, a boy and girl of ten, appeared, dragging after them a box mounted on rough wooden wheels in which there sat a round, pink, blue-eyed cherub of a baby. Shouting with laughter, they came tearing up the garden path to their mother's side.  \"Hush, my children,\" said Mother Adolf, laying her finger on her lips. \"It is the Angelus.\"  The shouts were instantly silenced, and the two children stood beside the mother with clasped hands and bowed heads until the echoes of the bells died away in the distance.  Far down on the long path to the village a man, bending under the weight of a huge basket, also stood still for a moment in silent prayer, then toiled again up the steep slope.  \"See,\" cried Mother Adolf as she lifted her head, \"there comes Father from the village with bread for our supper in his basket. Run, Seppi, and help him bring the bundles home. Our Fritz will soon be coming with the goats, too, and he and Father will both be as hungry as wolves and in a hurry for their supper. Hark!\" she paused to listen.  Far away from out the blue shadows of the mountain came the sound of a horn playing a merry little tune.  \"There's Fritz now,\" cried Mother Adolf. \"Hurry, Seppi, and you, Leneli, come with me to the kitchen. You can give little Roseli her supper, while I spread the table and set the soup to boil before the goats get here to be milked.\" She lifted the baby in her arms as she spoke, and set off at a smart pace toward the house, followed by Leneli dragging the cart and playing peek-a-boo with the baby over her mother's shoulder.  When they reached the door, Leneli sat down on the step, and Mother Adolf put the baby in her arms and went at once into the quiet house. Then there was a sound of quick steps about the kitchen, a rattling of the stove, and a clatter of tins which must have pleased the cuckoo, and soon she reappeared in the door with a bowl and spoon in her hands.  The bowl she gave to Leneli, and little Roseli, crowing with delight, seized the spoon and stuck it first into an eye, and then into her tiny pink button of a nose, in a frantic effort to find her mouth. It was astonishing to Baby Roseli how that rosebud mouth of hers managed to hide itself, even though she was careful to keep it wide open while she searched for it. When she had explored her whole face with the spoon in vain, Leneli took the tiny hand in hers and guided each mouthful down the little red lane.  Over their heads the robin in the cherry tree by the door sat high up on a twig and chirped a good-night song to his nestlings. \"Cherries are ripe, cherries are ripe, cherries are ripe in June,\" sang the robin. At least that is what Leneli told the baby he said, and surely she ought to know.  Before Baby Roseli had finished the last mouthful of her supper, Father and Seppi appeared with the bundles, and then there was the clatter of many little hoofs on the hard earth of the door-yard, and round the corner of the old gray farm-house came big brother Fritz with the goats. With Fritz came Bello, his faithful dog, barking and wagging his tail for joy at getting home again. Bello ran at once to Leneli and licked her hand, nearly upsetting the bowl of milk in his noisy greeting, and the baby crowed with delight and seized him by his long, silky ears.  \"Down, Bello, down,\" cried Leneli, holding the bowl high out of reach; \"you'll spill the baby's supper!\" And Bello, thinking she meant that he should beg for it, sat up on his hind legs with his front paws crossed and barked three times, as Fritz had taught him to do.  \"He must have a bite or he'll forget his manners,\" laughed Fritz, and Leneli broke off a crumb of bread and tossed it to him. Bello caught it before it fell, swallowed it at one gulp, and begged for more.  \"No, no,\" said Leneli,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3497"],["title","The Swiss Twins (#1)"],["body"," \"good old Bello, go now with Fritz and help him drive the goats to the milking-shed, and by and by you shall have your supper.\"  Fritz whistled, and instantly Bello was off like a shot after Nanni, the brown goat, who was already on her way to the garden to eat the young green carrot-tops she saw peeping out of the ground.  \"It's time that child was in bed,\" said the cuckoo to himself, and out he came from his little house and called \"cuckoo\" seven times so reproachfully that Leneli hastened upstairs with the baby and put her down in her crib at once.  Baby Roseli did not agree with the cuckoo. She wanted to stay up and play with Bello, and hear the robin sing, but Leneli sat down beside the crib, and while Mother Adolf milked the goats she sang over and over again an old song.   \"Sleep, baby, sleep!   Thy father watches the sheep,   Thy mother is shaking the dreamland tree   And down falls a little dream on thee.   Sleep, baby, sleep!\"    \"Sleep, baby, sleep!   The large stars are the sheep,   The little stars are the lambs, I guess,   And the silver moon is the shepherdess.   Sleep, baby, sleep!\"  Over and over she sang it, until at last the heavy lids closed over the blue eyes. Then she crept quietly down the creaking stairs in the dark, and ate her bread and cheese and drank her soup by candle-light with her father and mother, Seppi and Fritz, all seated about the kitchen table.  By nine o'clock the room was once more silent and deserted, the little mouse was creeping quietly from his hole in the wall, and Bello lay by the door asleep with his nose on his paws. High over Mt. Pilatus the moon sailed through the star-lit sky, bathing the old gray farm-house in silver light and playing hide and seek with shadows on the snow-capped peaks.  \"Cuckoo,\" called the tiny wooden cuckoo nine times, and at once the bells in the village steeple answered him. \"That's as it should be,\" ticked the cuckoo. \"That church-bell is really very intelligent. Let me see; to-morrow morning I must wake the roosters at three, and the sun at four, and the family must be up by five. I'll just turn in and get a wink of sleep myself while I can,\" and he popped into the clock ones more and shut the door.     II. THE TWINS LEARN A NEW TRADE  THE TWINS LEARN A NEW TRADE   At five o'clock the next morning Father and Mother Adolf were already up, and the cuckoo woke Fritz, but though he shouted five times with all his might and main, neither Seppi nor Leneli stirred in their sleep.  \"Fritz, go wake the Twins,\" said Mother Adolf, when he came to the door of the shed where she was milking the goats. \"Only don't wake the baby. I want her to sleep as long as she will.\"  \"Yes, Mother,\" said Fritz dutifully, and he was off at once, leaping up the creaky stairs three steps at a time.  He went first to Leneli's bed and tickled her toes. She drew up her knees and slept on. Then he went to Seppi's bed, and when shaking and rolling over failed to rouse him, he took him by one leg and pulled him out of bed. Seppi woke up with a roar and cast himself upon Fritz, and in a moment the two boys were rolling about on the floor, yelling like Indians. The uproar woke Leneli, and the baby too, and Mother Adolf, hearing the noise, came running from the goat-shed just in time to find Seppi sitting on top of Fritz beating time on his stomach to a tune which he was singing at the top of his lungs. The baby was crowing with delight as she watched the scuffle from Leneli's arms.  Mother Adolf gazed upon this lively scene with dismay. Then she picked Seppi off Fritz's stomach and gazed sternly at her oldest son. \"Fritz,\" said she, \"I told you to be quiet and not wake the baby.\"  \"I was quiet,\" said Fritz, sitting up. \"I was just as quiet as I could be, but they wouldn't wake up that way, so I had to pull Seppi out of bed; there was no other way to get him up.\" He looked up at his mother with such honest eyes that in spite of herself her lips twitched and then she smiled outright.  \"I should have known better than to send such a great overgrown pup of a boy as you on such an errand,\" she said. \"Bello would have done it better. Next time I shall send him.  \"And now, since you are all awake, I will tell you the great news that Father told me last night. He has been chosen by the commune to take the herds of the village up to the high alps to be gone all summer. He will take Fritz with him to guard the cattle while he makes the cheese. There is no better cheese-maker in all the mountains than your father, and that is why the commune chose him,\" she finished proudly.  More than anything else in the world, every boy in that part of Switzerland longs to go with the herds to the high mountain pastures for the summer, and Fritz was so delighted that he turned a somersault at once to express his feelings. When he was right side up again, a puzzled look came over his face, and he said, \"Who will take care of our own goats?\"  \"Ah,\" answered his mother, and she sighed a little. \"There is no one but Seppi and Leneli. Together they must fill your place, and you, Fritz, must take them with you to-day up the mountain to learn the way and begin their work.\"  \"To-day! This very day?\" screamed the Twins. They had never been up to the goat-pastures in their lives, and it was a most exciting event.  Then Leneli thought of her mother. She flung her arms about her neck. \"But who will stay with you, dear Mother?\" she cried. \"All day you will be alone, with everything to do and no one to speak to but the baby.\"  \"Yes,\" sighed the mother, \"that is true. It will be a long, lonely summer for me, but there is no other way, so we must each do our part bravely and not complain. It is good fortune that Father and Fritz will both be earning money in the alps, and, with wise old Bello to help you, you will soon be as good goatherds as your brother. Come, now, hurry and eat your breakfasts, for the goats are already milked and impatient to be gone.\"  She took Roseli in her arms and disappeared down the stairs, and when, a few moments later, the Twins and Fritz came into the kitchen, she had their breakfast of bread and milk ready for them, and their luncheon of bread and cheese wrapped in a clean white cloth for Fritz to put in his pocket.  Father Adolf came back from the garden, where he had been hoeing potatoes, to see the little procession start away for the hills. First came the goats, frisking about in the fresh morning air and jingling all their bells. Then came Bello, looking very important, then Fritz with a cock's feather in his cap and his little horn and his cup slung over his shoulder, and last of all the Twins.  \"It's a long way, my children,\" said Mother Adolf, as she kissed them good-bye. \"Your legs will get tired, but you must climb on just the same. If every one stopped when he was tired, the world's work would never be done. Learn the way carefully and remember always to pray if any danger comes. You are very near the good God on the mountain, and He will take care of you if you ask Him, never fear.\"  \"Obey Fritz,\" said Father Adolf, \"and do not stray off by yourselves. Stay always with Fritz and the goats.\"  \"We will,\" cried the Twins, and away they ran to join their brother, who was already some little distance ahead of them. They turned as the path rounded the great cliff where the echoes lived, and the Twins waved their hands, while Fritz played his merry little tune on the horn. Then the rocks hid them from view, and the long climb began in earnest.  It was many rough uphill miles to the alps where the goats were pastured, and the stout little legs ached with weariness long before they reached the patches of green grass which were reserved for them. On the way up they passed fields where cows were grazing, and Bello had hard work to keep the goats in the path, but these pastures were only for cows, and goats were not allowed in them. For two hours they climbed steadily up and up, following a mountain path that led sometimes beside a rushing brook, sometimes along the edges of dizzy precipices, and always among rocks with wonderful views of distant snow-capped peaks above them and green, green valleys below.  At last, when it seemed to the weary children that they could not go another step, they came out upon a high pasture, where Fritz called a halt. The goats leaped joyfully forward, snatching greedy mouthfuls of the rich green grass which grew among the rocks. Bello flopped heavily down on a flat stone with his tongue hanging out, and Fritz and the Twins rolled over on their backs on a soft carpet of grass to rest.  Almost at once Seppi said, \"I'm hungry.\"  \"So 'm I,\" said Leneli.  \"You'll be hungry all the time up here,\" said Fritz encouragingly. \"It's the air.\"  \"Let's eat,\" urged Seppi.  Fritz took the package of luncheon from his pocket and opened it.  \"It looks very small. It looks a great deal smaller than it did at home,\" said Leneli. \"I wonder why?\"  \"You are hungrier now than you were then,\" said Fritz.  \"I could eat it all myself,\" said Seppi.  \"But you won't,\" laughed Fritz; \"I'll see to that.\" He divided the bread and cheese into three equal portions and handed one to each of the Twins. The third he put in his own pocket. \"Now I don't care what you do with yours,\" he said; \"only, if you eat it all now, you'll be hungry enough to browse with the goats before it's time to go home. Better take just a bite and a drink of water and eat more by and by.\"  Seppi looked hungrily at his portion and took a bite. Then he just couldn't stop, and before he knew it his whole luncheon was gone and it was only nine o'clock in the morning!  Leneli took two bites of hers, and then, wrapping it carefully in the piece of cloth, placed it high up on an overhanging rock out of the way of temptation. Then, while Fritz was teaching Seppi all the tricks of a goat-boy's trade, she found a soft patch of grass all spangled with blue gentians and fell asleep with her head on her arm. She slept"]]]
