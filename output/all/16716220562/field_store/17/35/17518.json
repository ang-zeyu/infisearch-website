When this occurs move the glass forward to the end of the outer zone _B_, but keep it sufficiently within the flame to maintain it at a high temperature. If all is right the metallic reduction will quickly disappear, the glass will become perfectly transparent once more, and will present the appearance previously observed in the experiments with the pointed flame, or, if very hot, assume a brownish-red appearance. If this does not occur, the supply of air must be increased or the supply of gas diminished until the proper effects are secured.  [5] Nevertheless the supply of air must not be so excessive as to reduce the temperature of the flame sufficiently to prevent the thorough softening of the glass, which will occur if the bellows is worked with too much zeal.  In working upon lead glass with the highly oxidising brush flame, it is a good plan to heat it in the reducing part of the flame _A_ for thoroughly softening the glass, and to remove it to the oxidising flame _B_ to burn away the reduced metal. In prolonged operations, in order that reduction may never go too far, hold the glass alternately in the hot reducing flame and in the oxidising flame. The inferiority of the outer oxidising flame to those portions nearer the inner blue zone for softening the glass, may perhaps be accounted for by the presence of a larger proportion of unconsumed air in the former, which being heated at the expense of the hot gases produced by combustion, thereby lowers the temperature of the flame. At or near _A_ (Fig. 4) where the combustion is nearly complete, but no excess of air exists, the temperature will naturally be highest.  If a very large tube be rotated in the oxidising flame at _B_ (Fig. 4) it may happen that the flame is not large enough to surround the tube, and that as it is rotated those parts of it which are most remote from the flame will cool down too considerably to allow all parts of the tube to be simultaneously brought into the desired condition. This difficulty may be overcome by placing two blow-pipes exactly opposite to each other, at such a distance that there is an interval of about an inch between the extremities of their flames, and rotating the tube between the two flames. It may be necessary to provide two blowers for the blow-pipes if they are large.  Again, if a very narrow zone of a tube of moderate size is to be heated, two pointed flames may be similarly arranged with advantage. Occasionally more than two flames are made to converge upon one tube in this manner.  Another method of preventing one side of a tube from cooling down whilst the other is presented to the flame, is to place a brick at a short distance from the extremity of the flame. The brick checks the loss of heat considerably. A block of beech wood may be used for the same purpose, the wood ignites and thereby itself becomes a source of heat, and is even more effective than a brick.  Fuller details of the management of lead glass under various circumstances will be found in the subsequent descriptions of operations before the blow-pipe.  Before proceeding to work with soda glass, the student should not only verify by experiments what has been already said, but he should familiarise himself with the action of the blow-pipe flame on lead glass by trying the glass in every part of the flame, varying the proportions of gas and air in every way, repeating, and repeating, his experiments until he can obtain any desired effect with certainty and promptitude. He should practice some of the simpler operations given in Chapter III. in order to impress what he has learned well on his mind.   =Management of Soda Glass.=--In working with soda glass the following points must be constantly kept in mind. That as it is much more apt than lead glass to crack when suddenly heated, great caution must be exercised in bringing it into the flame; and that in making large joints or in making two joints near each other, all parts of the tube adjacent to that which, for the moment, is being heated, must be kept hot, as it is very apt to crack when adjacent parts are unequally heated. This may be effected by stopping work at short intervals and warming the cooler parts of the tube, or by the use of the brick or block of wood to check radiation, or even by placing a supplementary blow-pipe or Bunsen burner in such a position that its flame plays upon the more distant parts of the work, not coming sufficiently into contact to soften the glass, however, but near enough to keep it well heated. Lastly, to prevent the finished work from falling to pieces after or during cooling, the directions given under the head of annealing must be carefully carried out.  In very much of his work the glass-blower is guided more by the _feel_ of the glass than by what he sees. The power of feeling glass can only be acquired by practice, and after a certain amount of preliminary failure. As a rule I have observed that beginners are apt to raise their glass to a higher temperature than is necessary, and that they employ larger flames than are wanted. If glass be made too soft it may fall so completely out of shape as to become unworkable except in very skilful hands. The following rules, therefore, should be strictly adhered to. Always employ in the first instance the smallest flame that is likely to do the work required. In operations involving _blowing out_ viscous glass, attempt to blow the glass at low temperatures before higher ones are tried. After a little experience the adoption of the right-sized flame for a given purpose, and the perception of the best condition of glass for blowing it, become almost automatic.  I may add that glass which is to be bent needs to be much less heated than glass which is to be blown.   =Annealing.=--If apparatus, the glass of which is very thin and of uniform substance, be heated, on removal from the source of heat it will cool equally throughout, and therefore may often be heated and cooled without any special precautions. If the glass be thick, and especially if it be of unequal thickness in various parts, the thinner portions will cool more quickly than those which are more massive; this will result in the production of tension between the thicker and thinner parts in consequence of inequality in the rates of contraction, and fractures will occur either spontaneously or upon any sudden shock. Thus, if a hot tube be touched with cold or wet iron, or slightly scratched with a cold file, the inequality of the rate of cooling is great, and it breaks at once. It is therefore necessary to secure that hot glass shall cool as regularly as possible. And this is particularly important in the case of articles made of soda glass. Some glass-blowers content themselves with permitting the glass to cool gradually in a smoky flame till it is covered with carbon, and then leave it to cool upon the table. But under this treatment many joints made of soda glass which are not quite uniform in substance, but otherwise serviceable, will break down. In glass-works the annealing is done in ovens so arranged that the glass enters at the hottest end of the oven where it is uniformly heated to a temperature not much below that at which it becomes viscous, and slowly passed through the cooler parts of the chamber so that it emerges cold at the other end. This method of annealing is not practicable in a small laboratory. But fortunately very good results can be obtained by the following simple device, viz.:--  By wrapping the hot apparatus that is to be annealed closely in cotton wool, and leaving it there till quite cold. The glass should be wrapped up immediately after it is blown into its final shape, as soon as it is no longer soft enough to give way under slight pressure. And it should be heated as uniformly as possible, not only at the joint, but also about the parts adjacent to the joint, at the moment of surrounding it with the cotton. Lead glass appears to cool more regularly than soda glass, and these precautions may be more safely neglected with apparatus made of lead glass; but not always. At the date of writing I have had several well-blown joints of thick-walled capillary tube to No. 16 (see diagram, p. 82), break during cooling, in consequence of circumstances making it dangerous to heat the neighbourhood of the joint so much as was necessary.  The black carbonaceous coat formed on hot glass when it is placed in cotton wool may be removed by wiping with methylated spirit, or, if it be very closely adherent, by gently rubbing with fine emery, moistened with the spirit.  Cotton wool is rather dangerously inflammable; it should therefore be kept out of reach of the blow-pipe flame, and care should be taken that the glass is not placed in contact with it at a sufficiently high temperature to cause its ignition.  Another method of annealing is to cover the hot glass with hot sand, and allow it to cool therein.  As in the case of lead glass, so with soda glass. A thorough acquaintance with the effect of the various parts of the flame upon it should be gained before further work is entered upon, for which purpose an hour or more spent in observing its behaviour in the flame will be fully repaid by increased success subsequently.   =The Use of Combustion Tube.=--It is often necessary to construct apparatus of what is known as hard glass or combustion tube. It is almost as easy to work combustion tube as to deal with lead and soda glass if the oxy-hydrogen flame be employed.  It is not necessary to set up a special apparatus for this purpose; many of the ordinary blow-pipes can be used with oxygen instead of with air. It is only necessary to connect the air-tube of the blow-pipe with a bottle of compressed oxygen instead of with the bellows. The connecting tube"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33941"],["title","The Methods of Glass Blowing and of Working Silica in the Oxy-Gas Flame (#5)"],["body","not be too wide nor too long, in order to avoid the accumulation in it, by accident, of large quantities of explosive mixtures.  Two precautions are necessary in manipulating hard glass in the oxy-hydrogen flame. The glass must _not_ be overheated. At first one is very apt to go wrong in this direction. The supply of oxygen must _not_ be too great; a small hissing flame is not what is wanted. If either of these precautions are neglected most glass will devitrify badly. With a little care and experience, devitrification can be absolutely avoided. Ordinary combustion tube can be used, but I find that the glass tube (Verbrennungsröhr) made by Schott & Co. of Jena, which can be obtained through any firm of dealers in apparatus, is far better than the ordinary tube.  By following these instructions, any one who has learned how to work with lead or soda glass will find it easy to manipulate hard glass.     CHAPTER III.  _CUTTING AND BENDING GLASS--FORMING GLASS APPARATUS BEFORE THE BLOW-PIPE--MAKING AND GRINDING STOPPERS TO APPARATUS, ETC._   In the later pages of this Chapter it will be assumed that the operations first described have been mastered. The beginner should therefore practise each operation until he finds himself able to perform it with some degree of certainty. Generally speaking, however, after the failure of two or three attempts to perform any operation, it is best to give up for a few hours, and proceed to the work next described, returning to that upon which you have failed subsequently. If, unfortunately, it should happen that the work next in order involves the performance of the operation in which the failure has occurred, it is best to pass on to some later work which does not demand this particular accomplishment, or to rest a while, and re-attack the difficulty when refreshed.   =Cutting Glass Tubes.=--The simplest method of cutting a glass tube is to make a sharp scratch with a file across the glass at the point where it is desired to cut it, and on pulling apart the two ends, it will break clean off. It is important that the file be sharp. In pulling apart the ends the scratch should be held upwards, and the pull should have a downward direction, which will tend to open out the scratch. In the case of a large tube, a scratch will not ensure its breaking clean across. The tube must be filed to some depth, half-way, or even all round it. A good way of breaking a tube is to place the file in the table after scratching the glass, to hold the glass tube above its edge with one hand on each side of the scratch, and to strike the under side of the tube a sharp blow upon the edge of the file, directly beneath the scratch. In this way very even fractures of large and moderately thin tubes may be made. It answers particularly well for removing short ends of tube, not long enough to hold; the tube is held firmly upon the file, and a sharp blow given to the short end with a piece of large tube or a key.  A file whose faces have been ground till they are nearly smooth, so as to leave very finely-serrated edges, will be found useful for cutting glass tubes. Such a file should be used almost as a knife is used for cutting a pencil in halves.  The simple methods just described are too violent to be applied to delicate apparatus, too tedious when employed upon the largest tubes, and very difficult to apply when the tube to be cut is very thin, or too short to permit the operator to get a good grip of it on either side of the file mark. In such cases, one or other of the following methods will be useful:--  1. Make a scratch with a file, and touch it with the end of a _very small_ piece of glass drawn out and heated at the tip to its melting point. It is important that the heated point of glass be very small, or the fracture is likely to be uneven, or to spread in several directions. Also, it is best to use hot soda glass for starting cracks in tubes of soda glass, and lead glass for doing so in lead glass tubes. If the crack does not pass quite round the tube, you may pull it asunder, as previously described, or you may bring the heated piece of glass with which the crack was started to one end of the crack, and slowly move it (nearly touching the glass) in the required direction; the crack will extend, following the movements of the hot glass. Instead of hot glass, pastils of charcoal are sometimes employed for this purpose. They continue to burn when once lighted, and there is no need to re-heat them from time to time. They should be brought as close to the glass as is possible without touching it, and, when no longer needed, should be extinguished by placing the lighted end under sand, or some other incombustible powder, for they must not be wetted.  2. A method much practised by the makers of sheet glass, and suitable for large objects, is to wrap a thread of hot glass round the tube, at once removing it, and touching any point of the glass which the thread covered with water or a cold iron, when a crack will be started and will pass round the glass where it was heated by the thread.  3. Tubes which are large and slightly conical may have a ring of red-hot iron passed over them till it comes into contact with the glass, then, the iron being removed, and a point on the heated glass being at once touched with cold iron as before, it will break as desired. Or a string, moistened with turpentine, may be loosely twisted round the tube, and the turpentine ignited, afterwards the application of sudden cold to any point on the zone of hot glass will usually start a crack, which, if necessary, may be continued in the usual manner. The last three methods are chiefly useful in dealing with the largest and thickest tubes, and with bottles.  A fairly stout copper wire, bent into the form of a bow so that it can be applied when hot to a considerable surface of a glass tube, will be found superior to the point of hot glass or metal usually employed, for leading cracks in glass tubes. With such a wire a tube can be cut so that the cross section of the end is at any desired angle to the axis of the tube, with considerable precision. I am indebted for this suggestion to Mr. Vernon Boys and Dr. Ebert.   =Bending Glass Tubes.=--The blow-pipe flame is not a suitable source of heat for bending tubes, except in certain cases which will be mentioned in a subsequent paragraph. For small tubes, and those of moderate size, a fish-tail burner, such as is used for purposes of illumination, will answer best. Use a flame from one to two inches in breadth--from _A_ to _A_ (Fig. 6), according to the size of the tube which is to be bent. If the length of tube that is heated be less than this, the bend will probably buckle on its concave side.  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]  The tube to be heated should be held in the position shown in Fig. 6, supported by the hands on each side. It should be constantly rotated in the flame, that it may be equally heated on all sides. In the figure the hands are represented above the tube, with their backs upwards. A tube can be held equally well from below, the backs of the hands being then directed downwards, and this, I think, is the more frequent habit. It is difficult to say which position of the hands is to be preferred. I lately observed how a tube was held by three skilful amateurs and by a professional glass-blower. All the former held the tube with the hands below it. The latter, however, held it from above, as in Fig. 6. He, however, was working with a rather heavy piece of tube, and I am inclined myself to recommend that position in such cases. During a long spell of work, the wrist may be rested from time to time by changing the position of the hands.  When the tube has softened, remove it from the flame, and gently bend it to the desired angle. The side of the tube last exposed to the flame will be slightly hotter, and therefore softer, than that which is opposite to it. This hotter side should form the concave side of the bent tube.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.]  The exact condition in which the glass is most suitable for bending can only be learned by making a few trials. If it is too soft in consequence of being overheated, the sides will collapse. If, in the endeavour to heat the side _A_ of Fig. 7 a little more than _B_, _B_ is insufficiently heated, the tube will be likely to break on the convex side _B_. If the bent tube be likely to become flattened, and this cannot always be prevented in bending very thin tubes, the fault may be avoided by blowing gently into one end of the tube whilst bending it, for which purpose the other end should be closed beforehand. A tube already flattened may, to some extent, be blown into shape after closing one end and re-heating the bent portion, but it is not easy to give it a really good shape.  When making a bend like that in Fig. 7, to secure that the arms of the tube _C_ and _D_, and the curve at _B_, shall be in one plane, the tube should be held in a position perpendicular to the body, and brought into the position shown in the figure during bending, by which means it will be found easy to secure a good result. Lead glass tubes must be removed from the flame before they become hot enough to undergo reduction. If they should become blackened, however, the stain may be removed by re-heating in the oxidising flame (see p. 18).  When a very sharp bend is to be made, it is sometimes best to heat a narrow zone of the glass rather highly in the blow-pipe flame, and to blow the bend into shape at the moment of bending it, as previously described, one end having been closed for that purpose beforehand. Lead glass should be heated for this purpose in the oxidising flame (pp. 17 to 22).  The processes of bending large tubes, making U-tubes and spiral tubes, are more difficult operations, and will be explained in Chap. IV.   =Rounding and Bordering the Ends of Tubes.=--After cutting a piece of glass tube in two pieces, the sharp edges left at its ends should"]]]
