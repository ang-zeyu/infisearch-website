Specimens were most effectively collected by digging into the gravel above the seine and allowing the gravel to wash into the seine. In 1952, Cross (1954:311) found this species in abundance in riffles at the confluence of the South Fork and Cottonwood River, and at several other localities in the Neosho mainstream (personal communication). The Neosho madtom is nearly restricted to gravel riffles having moderate flow; therefore, it may be drastically reduced by intermittency of flow. I found none in 1957 and few in 1958. By 1959, the third summer of continuous flow, the Neosho madtom was again common.   #Fundulus notatus# (Rafinesque)  Black-striped Topminnow  The black-striped topminnow was rare in the mainstream at the lower Marais des Cygnes and the middle and lower Neosho stations, where it was found in quiet water near shore.  Near the middle Neosho station, a large population was present in an oxbow lake that is frequently flooded by the river.   #Labidesthes sicculus# (Cope)  Brook Silversides  The brook silversides occurred rarely at the lower Marais des Cygnes and at the middle and lower Neosho stations.   #Micropterus dolomieui# Lacépède  Small-mouthed Bass  One individual was taken at the lower Neosho station in 1957.   #Micropterus punctulatus punctulatus# (Rafinesque)  Spotted Bass  The spotted bass occurs in Kansas only in the southeastern part of the state--in southern tributaries of the Osage system, in Spring River drainage, and in relatively clear streams of the Flint Hills. At my stations on the Neosho River, this fish was more abundant in 1957 than in 1958 or 1959.  Spotted bass were taken most frequently over rubble bottom or near boulders in moderate current. Collections made in the evening or early morning more often contained spotted bass than collections made at other times of day (Table 9). Data from a few specimens that were marked, released, and recaptured indicated that the species is relatively sedentary; therefore, the greater abundance in the morning and evening collections probably indicates increased activity during these periods, possibly in connection with feeding. The spawning season in 1957 may have continued as late as 10 July when a ripe female 11.3 inches T. L. was taken. Young-of-the-year were taken on 24 June in moderate current over gravel bottom and in quiet water over mud bottom.  Spotted bass normally form a small part of the game-fish fauna in the lower Neosho River. The species attains greater abundance in smaller, clear streams of the Arkansas River Basin in Kansas (Cross, 1954, and unpublished data of State Biological Survey of Kansas). During the drought, the lower Neosho probably assumed many characteristics of a smaller stream in normal times. Flow was reduced or entirely interrupted and turbidity was lessened. These conditions resulted in faunal changes in which spotted bass were more prominent than in years of normal flow. During this period of reduced flow, some fishermen turned from catfishing to bass-fishing; I think this constitutes evidence for an increase in numbers of bass, accompanied by a decrease in numbers of channel catfish. With the return of continuous flow and a consequent rise in turbidity, bass declined in abundance in the mainstream.   #Micropteras salmoides salmoides# (Lacépède)  Large-mouthed Bass  The large-mouth was rare at all stations. It prefers quiet water near cover; to become abundant, the large-mouth probably requires clearer water than is afforded by most Kansas streams. This species, like spotted bass, declined in abundance during the period of study. Nevertheless, young-of-the-year were taken in 1957 and 1958 (earliest date of capture, 7 June in 1958).   #Lepomis cyanellus# Rafinesque  Green Sunfish  Green sunfish were taken at all stations, but most abundantly at the upper Neosho station where the number captured increased slightly from 1957 to 1959. Young-of-the-year and adults were most common in shallow backwater. At the upper Neosho station green sunfish inhabit quiet pools, where recaptures of marked fish indicated that the species is notably sedentary in habit. Hasler and Wisby (1958) have shown that green sunfish exhibit a homing reaction.  This fish provides some sport for fishermen, especially in the smaller streams, but I found few green sunfish that were larger than six inches T. L. at any station.   #Lepomis megalotis# (Rafinesque)  Long-eared Sunfish  Long-eared sunfish were taken at all stations but were notably more abundant in the Neosho River, where the largest population occurred at the upper station. In all three years of the study, large samples were obtained by means of rotenone in the same pool at the upper Neosho station. There were fewer long-eared sunfish present each year, and average size increased slightly. Collections in other pools at this station indicated that long-eared sunfish maintained a high level of abundance throughout my study.  Long-eared sunfish occurred in pools having bottoms of gravel or bedrock at the upper Neosho station, or near shore over rubble or gravel in slow to moderate current at the middle Neosho station.   #Lepomis humilis# (Girard)  Orange-spotted Sunfish  The orange-spotted sunfish occurred at all stations; it was most abundant in the Neosho River, especially at the uppermost station. This fish was taken in a variety of habitats, but was most common in areas where the current was slack, often over mud or silt bottom.   #Lepomis macrochirus# Rafinesque  Bluegill  Bluegill were taken at all stations but were rare. This species occurred exclusively in pools, usually near cover (brush or trees in the water). Bluegill are predominately pond-fish in Kansas, and populations in rivers may consist partly of individuals that escaped from ponds in time of overflow. I know of no stream in Kansas that has a population large enough to contribute significantly to the sport fishery.   #Pomoxis nigromaculatus# (LeSueur)  Black Crappie  This species was represented by only one specimen, taken at the lower Neosho station in 1957.   #Pomoxis annularis# Rafinesque  White Crappie  White crappie were taken at all stations, but were common only at the upper and middle stations on the Marais des Cygnes and the upper Neosho station. At the last station, this fish was abundant in a single large pool that contained much more water during drought than any other area at this station. There was little dispersal into several smaller pools, below the large pool, which were sampled in 1957, 1958 and 1959. White crappie were not taken in the lower pools until 1959, and then were rare. Most crappie were taken in quiet water near cover or near shore.  Young-of-the-year were found in 1957, 1958 and 1959, but never abundantly. At the lower Neosho station in 1959, ripe individuals were collected on 19 June, a spent female on 24 June, and young-of-the-year on 1 July. The young were present in quiet, shallow water over mud bottom at the lower end of a gravel bar. Large white crappie (10-14 inches T. L.) were common at the middle and lower Neosho stations in 1957 and in April, 1958. Large fish were almost entirely absent from later collections. Average size, maximum size and abundance declined during the period of study.   #Percina phoxocephala# (Nelson)  Slender-headed Darter  The slender-headed darter was taken at all stations but was more abundant in the Neosho than in the Marais des Cygnes. The lower Marais des Cygnes, however, was the only station with a relatively large population in 1957. Slender-headed darters were rare in the Neosho River in 1957 and did not become common until 1959.  The largest population was found at the upper Neosho station in 1959. This darter occurs most frequently in swift water over gravel bottom, but was taken in various habitats, including an intermittent pool at the upper Neosho station on 7 September, 1957.  At the middle and lower Neosho stations, considerably greater numbers were taken in June, July, and early August than in May or late August. The abundance in my collections diminished from a peak in early July, to scarcity in late August.  Young-of-the-year were taken at the lower Neosho station on 1 July, 1959 (and subsequently), in moderately fast water over gravel. On 21 August, 1958, a ripe female (eggs stripped easily) was the only slender-headed darter present in a collection from riffles at the middle Neosho station.   #Percina caprodes# (Rafinesque)  Logperch  Logperch were not taken in the Marais des Cygnes. They were rare in the Neosho, where they were taken most frequently at the upper station in water two to three feet deep, over gravel bottom, in moderate to slight current. This species was present in intermittent pools at the upper Neosho station in 1957.   #Percina copelandi# (Jordan)  Channel Darter  One specimen was taken at the lower Neosho station in 1959. Because no others ever have been found in the mainstream of the Neosho River, I suspect that my specimen is a \"stray\" from one of the smaller tributaries, where channel darters are locally common.   #Etheostoma flabellare# Rafinesque  Fan-tailed Darter  The fan-tailed darter is represented in my collections by one specimen, obtained in the mainstream of the Neosho River at the lower station in 1957. Records of this species in Kansas are almost confined to the smallest, clear, permanent streams of the southeastern part of the state. My specimen may represent a small population that retreated to the mainstream of the Neosho during drought.   #Etheostoma spectabile# (Agassiz)  Orange-throated Darter  Orange-throated darters were common at the upper Marais des Cygnes and upper Neosho stations in 1959, rare at the middle and lower Neosho stations, and absent from the middle and lower Marais des Cygnes stations. The species was found almost exclusively on upstream riffles over gravel-rubble bottom. The population in the upper Neosho was decimated by drought, and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3479"],["title","The Metal Monster (#0)"],["body","METAL MONSTER   By A. Merritt     PROLOGUE  Before the narrative which follows was placed in my hands, I had never seen Dr. Walter T. Goodwin, its author.  When the manuscript revealing his adventures among the pre-historic ruins of the Nan-Matal in the Carolines (The Moon Pool) had been given me by the International Association of Science for editing and revision to meet the requirements of a popular presentation, Dr. Goodwin had left America. He had explained that he was still too shaken, too depressed, to be able to recall experiences that must inevitably carry with them freshened memories of those whom he loved so well and from whom, he felt, he was separated in all probability forever.  I had understood that he had gone to some remote part of Asia to pursue certain botanical studies, and it was therefore with the liveliest surprise and interest that I received a summons from the President of the Association to meet Dr. Goodwin at a designated place and hour.  Through my close study of the Moon Pool papers I had formed a mental image of their writer. I had read, too, those volumes of botanical research which have set him high above all other American scientists in this field, gleaning from their curious mingling of extremely technical observations and minutely accurate but extraordinarily poetic descriptions, hints to amplify my picture of him. It gratified me to find I had drawn a pretty good one.  The man to whom the President of the Association introduced me was sturdy, well-knit, a little under average height. He had a broad but rather low forehead that reminded me somewhat of the late electrical wizard Steinmetz. Under level black brows shone eyes of clear hazel, kindly, shrewd, a little wistful, lightly humorous; the eyes both of a doer and a dreamer.  Not more than forty I judged him to be. A close-trimmed, pointed beard did not hide the firm chin and the clean-cut mouth. His hair was thick and black and oddly sprinkled with white; small streaks and dots of gleaming silver that shone with a curiously metallic luster.  His right arm was closely bound to his breast. His manner as he greeted me was tinged with shyness. He extended his left hand in greeting, and as I clasped the fingers I was struck by their peculiar, pronounced, yet pleasant warmth; a sensation, indeed, curiously electric.  The Association's President forced him gently back into his chair.  “Dr. Goodwin,” he said, turning to me, “is not entirely recovered as yet from certain consequences of his adventures. He will explain to you later what these are. In the meantime, Mr. Merritt, will you read this?”  I took the sheets he handed me, and as I read them felt the gaze of Dr. Goodwin full upon me, searching, weighing, estimating. When I raised my eyes from the letter I found in his a new expression. The shyness was gone; they were filled with complete friendliness. Evidently I had passed muster.  “You will accept, sir?” It was the president's gravely courteous tone.  “Accept!” I exclaimed. “Why, of course, I accept. It is not only one of the greatest honors, but to me one of the greatest delights to act as a collaborator with Dr. Goodwin.”  The president smiled.  “In that case, sir, there is no need for me to remain longer,” he said. “Dr. Goodwin has with him his manuscript as far as he has progressed with it. I will leave you two alone for your discussion.”  He bowed to us and, picking up his old-fashioned bell-crowned silk hat and his quaint, heavy cane of ebony, withdrew. Dr. Goodwin turned to me.  “I will start,” he said, after a little pause, “from when I met Richard Drake on the field of blue poppies that are like a great prayer-rug at the gray feet of the nameless mountain.”  The sun sank, the shadows fell, the lights of the city sparkled out, for hours New York roared about me unheeded while I listened to the tale of that utterly weird, stupendous drama of an unknown life, of unknown creatures, unknown forces, and of unconquerable human heroism played among the hidden gorges of unknown Asia.  It was dawn when I left him for my own home. Nor was it for many hours after that I laid his then incomplete manuscript down and sought sleep--and found a troubled sleep.  A. MERRITT     CHAPTER I. VALLEY OF THE BLUE POPPIES  In this great crucible of life we call the world--in the vaster one we call the universe--the mysteries lie close packed, uncountable as grains of sand on ocean's shores. They thread gigantic, the star-flung spaces; they creep, atomic, beneath the microscope's peering eye. They walk beside us, unseen and unheard, calling out to us, asking why we are deaf to their crying, blind to their wonder.  Sometimes the veils drop from a man's eyes, and he sees--and speaks of his vision. Then those who have not seen pass him by with the lifted brows of disbelief, or they mock him, or if his vision has been great enough they fall upon and destroy him.  For the greater the mystery, the more bitterly is its verity assailed; upon what seem the lesser a man may give testimony and at least gain for himself a hearing.  There is reason for this. Life is a ferment, and upon and about it, shifting and changing, adding to or taking away, beat over legions of forces, seen and unseen, known and unknown. And man, an atom in the ferment, clings desperately to what to him seems stable; nor greets with joy him who hazards that what he grips may be but a broken staff, and, so saying, fails to hold forth a sturdier one.  Earth is a ship, plowing her way through uncharted oceans of space wherein are strange currents, hidden shoals and reefs, and where blow the unknown winds of Cosmos.  If to the voyagers, painfully plotting their course, comes one who cries that their charts must be remade, nor can tell WHY they must be--that man is not welcome--no!  Therefore it is that men have grown chary of giving testimony upon mysteries. Yet knowing each in his own heart the truth of that vision he has himself beheld, lo, it is that in whose reality he most believes.  The spot where I had encamped was of a singular beauty; so beautiful that it caught the throat and set an ache within the breast--until from it a tranquillity distilled that was like healing mist.  Since early March I had been wandering. It was now mid-July. And for the first time since my pilgrimage had begun I drank--not of forgetfulness, for that could never be--but of anodyne for a sorrow which had held fast upon me since my return from the Carolines a year before.  No need to dwell here upon that--it has been written. Nor shall I recite the reasons for my restlessness--for these are known to those who have read that history of mine. Nor is there cause to set forth at length the steps by which I had arrived at this vale of peace.  Sufficient is to tell that in New York one night, reading over what is perhaps the most sensational of my books--“The Poppies and Primulas of Southern Tibet,” the result of my travels of 1910-1911, I determined to return to that quiet, forbidden land. There, if anywhere, might I find something akin to forgetting.  There was a certain flower which I long had wished to study in its mutations from the singular forms appearing on the southern slopes of the Elburz--Persia's mountainous chain that extends from Azerbaijan in the west to Khorasan in the east; from thence I would follow its modified types in the Hindu-Kush ranges and its migrations along the southern scarps of the Trans-Himalayas--the unexplored upheaval, higher than the Himalayas themselves, more deeply cut with precipice and gorge, which Sven Hedin had touched and named on his journey to Lhasa.  Having accomplished this, I planned to push across the passes to the Manasarowar Lakes, where, legend has it, the strange, luminous purple lotuses grow.  An ambitious project, undeniably fraught with danger; but it is written that desperate diseases require desperate remedies, and until inspiration or message how to rejoin those whom I had loved so dearly came to me, nothing less, I felt, could dull my heartache.  And, frankly, feeling that no such inspiration or message could come, I did not much care as to the end.  In Teheran I had picked up a most unusual servant; yes, more than this, a companion and counselor and interpreter as well.  He was a Chinese; his name Chiu-Ming. His first thirty years had been spent at the great Lamasery of Palkhor-Choinde at Gyantse, west of Lhasa. Why he had gone from there, how he had come to Teheran, I never asked. It was most fortunate that he had gone, and that I had found him. He recommended himself to me as the best cook within ten thousand miles of Pekin.  For almost three months we had journeyed; Chiu-Ming and I and the two ponies that carried my impedimenta.  We had traversed mountain roads which had echoed to the marching feet of the hosts of Darius, to the hordes of the Satraps. The highways of the Achaemenids--yes, and which before them had trembled to the tramplings of the myriads of the godlike Dravidian conquerors.  We had slipped over ancient Iranian trails; over paths which the warriors of conquering Alexander had traversed; dust of bones of Macedons, of Greeks, of Romans, beat about us; ashes of the flaming ambitions of the Sassanidae whimpered beneath our feet--the feet of an American botanist, a Chinaman, two Tibetan ponies. We had crept through clefts whose walls had sent back the howlings of the Ephthalites, the White Huns who had sapped the strength of these same proud Sassanids until at last both fell before the Turks.  Over the highways and byways of Persia's glory, Persia's shame and Persia's death we four--two men, two beasts--had passed. For a fortnight we had met no human soul, seen no sign of human habitation.  Game had been plentiful--green things Chiu-Ming might lack for his cooking, but meat never. About us was a welter of mighty summits. We were, I knew, somewhere within the blending of the Hindu-Kush with the Trans-Himalayas.  That morning we"]]]
