Joseph was sued before a magistrate's court in Painesville, on a vexatious suit. I carried him from Kirtland to Painesville, with four or five others, in my wagon, every morning for five days, and brought them back in the evening. We were often waylaid, but managed to elude our enemies by rapid driving and taking different roads. Esquire Bissell defended the Prophet and he came off victorious.  \"At this time our brethren in Jackson County, Missouri, were also suffering great persecution; about twelve hundred were driven, plundered and robbed, their houses burned, and some of the brethren were killed.  \"Mobs were organized around Kirtland, who were enraged against us, ready to destroy us.\"  Such was the state of affairs with the Church of the living God, at the close of the year 1833. Such was the nature of the action upon which the hero of this history had entered. But he was of the gold, not the dross of the earth, and passed through the fire, purified, yet not consumed.     CHAPTER VI.  THE GATHERING OF THE TITANS--HEBER'S TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH AND THE TWELVE--THEIR MIGHTY MISSION--THE TEST OF FAITH--ZION'S CAMP.   Joseph, Brigham and Heber together in Kirtland! By what strange fatality were these mighty lives thus interwoven? We have seen how Brigham and Heber came together, and how, from thenceforth, the currents of their lives and fortunes ran parallel. Now they were joined with Joseph, their prophet chief, like streams that swell a river.  Interesting is it also, if only as a coincidence, that so many of the leading spirits of the latter-day work should have been natives of Vermont--a diadem for thee, proud State, and one which thou wilt prize in coming time!--from whence scattered, ere acquaintance with the Gospel or with each other began, to meet as co-laborers in the same great cause, among the hills and dales of Northern Ohio. As though the heavens had decreed their lives should thus commingle.  And the heavens had so decreed. It was not chance, it was destiny \"shaping their ends,\" and fulfilling her mission in their behalf. And though from the ends of the earth--what matter names or nativity?--it had been the same. \"He that scattered Israel will gather him.\" From all nations that fated blood, when goes Jehovah's fiat forth, like the rain-drops sprinkled upon the hills, must trickle back to the Ocean whence it came.  It was a coalescing of divine affinities, the relinking of a spirit chain, which, though it often part, is never broken, and though seemingly divided, forever inseparable.  \"Are you ever going to be prepared to see God, Jesus Christ, His angels, or comprehend His servants, unless you take a faithful and prayerful course?\"  \"Did you actually know Joseph Smith?\"  The questions are Heber C. Kimball's, addressed in later years to a congregation of the Saints.  \"No,\" he answers for them, and continues:  \"Do you know Brother Brigham? No.\"  \"Do you know Brother Heber? No; you do not.\"  \"Do you know the Twelve? You do not; if you did you would begin to know God, and learn that those men who are chosen to direct and counsel you, are near kindred to God and to Jesus Christ, for the keys, power and authority of the kingdom of God are in that lineage.\"  This, then, was the purpose, the divine intending, for which they were now in conjunction; \"noble and great ones,\" great in the heavens and great upon the earth, ordained as \"rulers\" ere morning stars sang gladsome greeting, or Sons of God shouted for joy around the cradle of the infant world. This, the object of their descent from celestial empires; to build up a Kingdom unto God, and prepare the world for the coming of Him \"whose right it is to reign.\" Jewels from Jehovah's diadem, diamonds in the dust, unseen of saint or sinner in all their lustre, concealed from a world unworthy of the light it could not comprehend.  Had Heber's inspired mind probed the secret of Joseph's thought, expressed in his own oft-quoted words: \"Would to God, brethren, I could tell you who I am!\"  As Prophet, Seer, and Revelator to the Church of Jesus Christ, its president and earthly head, and holder of the keys of the last dispensation, Joseph was already in the high and holy office for which he was predestined and fore-ordained. Not so, Brigham; not so, Heber; not so their apostolic compeers. A trial of their faith was first necessary, a trial now near at hand, to prove them worthy in the flesh of the great calling whereunto they were called in the eternal councils.  In the month of February, 1834, came a commandment from the Almighty unto His prophet, to \"gather up the strength of His house,\" and \"go up and redeem Zion;\" in other words, to recover from the hands of a fierce and merciless mob the lands in Jackson County, Missouri, from which the Saints had been driven.  Such were the origin and object of Zion's Camp. Such, the nature of the perilous duty laid upon them.     CHAPTER VII.  THE REDEMPTION OF ZION--ENOCH'S CITY TO RETURN--OBJECT OF THE UNITED ORDER--CAUSE OF THE JACKSON COUNTY EXPULSION--THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF.   The redemption of Zion! The building of the new Jerusalem!  Theme of the ancient prophets and glory of the latter days!  Such was the sublime mission given to the Saints of the Most High. Thus came the word of the Lord concerning it, March, 1831:      \"Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern     lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my Church; go     ye forth into the western countries; * *      \"And with one heart and with one mind, gather up your riches that     ye may purchase an inheritance which shall hereafter be appointed     unto you,      \"And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city     of refuge, a place of safety for the Saints of the Most High God;      \"And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the     Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come     unto it, and it shall be called Zion.      \"And it shall come to pass, among the wicked, that every man that     will not take his sword against his neighbor, must needs flee unto     Zion for safety.      \"And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under     heaven; and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war     one with another.      \"And it shall be said among the wicked, let us not go up to battle     against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore     we cannot stand.      \"And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered     out from among all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with     songs of everlasting joy.\"  With this glorious object in view, this sublime motive firing their souls and filling their hearts with holy zeal, the Saints, in the summer of 1831, had commenced gathering upon the land of Zion--Jackson County, Missouri, the chosen site of the great city and temple of God. Their purpose, to fulfil prophecy, to found the modern Zion, New Jerusalem, capital city of the kingdom of God. A counterpart of the Zion of Enoch, sanctified of old and taken into the heavens, to return in latter times as a leaven of righteousness, to leaven this lump of clay, the mother earth of our mortality, and make it like unto itself, and in due time a glorified planet, purified, redeemed, and from sin forever free.  To prepare the world for that supreme hour \"when the Lord shall bring again Zion,\" was and is the mission of the Saints of latter days. And this that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says:      \"The Lord hath brought down Zion from above.      \"The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath.      \"The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength:      \"And truth is established in her bowels:      \"And the heavens have smiled upon her:      \"And she is clothed with the glory of her God:      \"For he stands in the midst of his people.\"  The meeting of the Zions! The marriage of the worlds! Zion from beneath, the type of truth from earth, embracing Zion from above, the symbol of righteousness from heaven.  \"And they twain shall be one!\"  Preparatory to this miraculous event, and indeed to render it possible, the order of Enoch, the system of divine economy whereby the Zion of the ancients was redeemed and sanctified, had been newly revealed to the Zion-builders of the last days.  What says Moses of Enoch and his city?      \"And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one     heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no     poor among them.\"  Oh, the sweetness of those simple words! Oh, the sublimity of the picture they portray! Liberty, equality, fraternity! This is Zion--THE PURE IN HEART!  But the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri, were not all that the Lord requires of a people chosen to execute a purpose so sacred, so sublime. \"There were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances.\" Then was the lash of the Philistine applied, and they were driven forth from the goodly land. Satan hath his mission, as well as Christ.  Be it not inferred, however, that these hapless victims of mobocratic tyranny were utterly wicked and depraved, or that all were equally culpable in the eyes of Him, who, to punish the transgressors, permitted their enemies to come against them. With all their faults they were better far than their oppressors, more than the peers, in every Christian virtue, of the people of the world around them. Yet, judged by the higher law, the Gospel standard, which the world had not received, and were not under the same obligation to obey, these \"children of the Light\" were found remiss in many things.  The Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a field of grain, gathered unto the threshing-floor. The purpose of divine punishment is to purify.

CHAPTER VIII.  THE ZION'S CAMP EXPEDITION--JOSEPH AS A PROPHET-GENERAL--FINDING OF THE BONES OF ZELPH, THE ANCIENT--REBELLION IN THE CAMP--JOSEPH PREDICTS A SCOURGE--HEBER'S FAILURE AS A LAUNDERER--ZION'S CAMP SAVED BY A STORM.  \"Gather up the strength of my house, and go up and redeem Zion!\" Such was the burden of God's command to Joseph and his brethren in Kirtland. Such was their interpretation of the divine message and call.  Bidding farewell to his family and friends, whom he hardly dared hope he would ever meet again in the flesh, Heber enrolled himself in the little band of heroes who set out from Kirtland early in May, 1834. They were about one hundred strong, well armed and equipped, and were led by the Prophet Joseph in person. Subsequently their number increased to two hundred and five souls. But Heber will tell his own story of that eventful pilgrimage. Says he:  \"Brother Joseph received a revelation concerning the redemption of Zion, part of which remains to be fulfilled. He sent messengers to the east and to the west and to the north and to the south, to gather up the Elders, and he gathered together as many of the brethren as he conveniently could, with what means they could spare, to go up to Zion, to render all the assistance that we could to our afflicted brethren. We gathered clothing and other necessaries to carry up to our brethren and sisters who had been plundered; and putting our horses to the wagons, and taking our firelocks and ammunition, we started on our journey; leaving only Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon and a few aged workmen who were engaged on the temple; so that there were very few men left in Kirtland. Our wagons were about full with baggage, etc., consequently we had to travel on foot.  \"We started on the 5th of May, and truly this was a solemn morning to me. I took leave of my wife and children and friends, not knowing whether I would see them again in the flesh, as myself and brethren were threatened both in that country and in Missouri by enemies, that they would destroy us and exterminate us from the land.  \"There were about one hundred brethren in our company who started for Zion. These brethren were nearly all young men, and nearly all Elders, Priests, Teachers and Deacons. The second day we arrived at New Portage, being about forty miles, at which place on the 7th we made regulations for traveling, and appointed a paymaster, whose name was Frederick G. Williams, and put all our moneys into a general fund. Some of the brethren had considerable, and others had little or none, yet all became equal. While here one of my horses received a kick from another horse, which obliged me to trade away my span, and get another span of older horses, from Jonathan Taylor. We then proceeded on our journey twelve miles to the Chippeway River. Here we pitched our tents under a fine grove.  \"The next day we were divided into companies of twelve each, and captains were appointed over each company. I organized my company in the following manner, appointing two to attend to cooking, two to see that fires were made, two to prepare the tent at night and likewise the bedding, and also to strike the tent each morning, two to fetch and provide water, one to do the running, two to attend the horses, see that the wagon was greased and everything prepared for starting. My business was to see that the company was provided for, and that all things were done in order. Our living generally was very good, being able to buy bread from the bakers or inhabitants on the way through the settled part of the country. After this we purchased flour and had to bake our own bread. We sometimes had to live on Johnny cake and corn dodger, and sometimes our living was scant. Every night before we went to bed we united in our tent and offered up our prayers before the Lord for protection. This was done by all the companies, at the sound of a trumpet; and at the sound of a trumpet in the morning, every man was upon his knees, each one being called upon in his turn to be mouth in prayer. The same order was attended to in each tent. There were general officers appointed over the company, viz: Joseph Smith, commander; Dr. F. G. Williams, quartermaster and historian of the camp; Zerubbabel Snow and Nathan Tanner, commissaries of subsistence; Sylvester Smith, adjutant; and Roger Orton, captain of the guard.  \"On the 8th we started on our journey, and on Saturday the 10th we passed through Mansfield, and camped for the Sabbath in Richfield. On Sunday the 11th Brother Sylvester Smith preached and the sacrament of bread and wine was administered to the company. On Monday the 12th we crossed over the Sandusky plains, and through the Indian settlements. We then passed through a long range of beech woods where the roads were very bad. In many instances we had to fasten ropes to the wagons to haul them out of the sloughs and mud holes by hand. While passing through the woods the brethren scattered on each side of the road and went to hunting for wild game. We came to Belle Fontaine, where we first discovered refractory feelings in Sylvester Smith.  \"We passed through a very pleasant country to Dayton, Ohio, where we crossed the Miami river, which is a very beautiful stream; the water being only about two and a half feet deep, most of the brethren waded it. We arrived at this place on Friday the 16th. The brethren were in good spirits, and the Lord was with us. On Saturday the 17th we passed into Indiana, just over the line betwixt the States of Ohio and Indiana, where we camped for the Sabbath, having traveled forty miles that day; our feet were very sore and blistered, and our stockings were wet with blood, the weather being very warm. I walked most of the journey, letting the lame and footsore ride in my stead. I frequently invited the Prophet to ride, seeing him lame and footsore. On such occasions he would bless me and my team with a hearty good will. My team performed the journey very well.  \"During the night a spy from the enemy attempted to get into our camp, but was stopped by the guard. We had our sentinels or guards appointed every night, on account of spies continually harrassing us. This evening there was quite a difficulty between some of the brethren and Sylvester Smith, on occasion of which Brother Joseph was called to decide the matter. Finding quite a rebellious spirit in Sylvester Smith, and to some extent in others, he said they would meet with misfortunes, difficulties and hindrances, 'and you will know it before you leave this place;' exhorting them to humble themselves before the Lord, and become united, that they might not be scourged. A very singular occurrence took place that night and the next day, concerning our teams. On the following morning when we arose we found almost every horse in the camp so badly foundered that we could scarcely lead them a few rods to the water. The brethren then deeply realized the effects of discord. When Brother Joseph learned the fact he exclaimed to the brethren that for a witness that God overruled and had His eye upon them, that all those who would humble themselves before the Lord should know that the hand of God was in this misfortune, and their horses should be restored to health immediately; and by twelve o'clock the same day the horses were as nimble as ever, with the exception of one of Sylvester Smith's which soon afterwards died.  \"May 21st we passed through Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana, where we crossed White River. The teams forded the river, and most of the brethren crossed over the new bridge which was unfinished. We had been threatened by our enemies that we should not go through the town, but we passed through unmolested. Everything appeared to be in perfect silence as we went through, although the people looked aghast as if fear had come upon them. At night we camped on an open spot, the top of an eminence. Here we lost one horse.  \"On Sunday, the 25th, we arrived at the edge of Illinois; we had no meeting, but attended to washing and baking to prepare for our journey. On the 26th we resumed our march. At night we were alarmed by the continual threatening of our enemies. I would here remark that notwithstanding so many threats were thrown out against us, we did not fear, nor hesitate to proceed on our journey, for God was with us, and angels went before us, and we had no fear of either men or devils. This we know because they (the angels) were seen. On Tuesday we came to the Okaw, a fork of the Kaskaskia River, where we found two canoes; we lashed them together and they served as a kind of ferry boat. We took our baggage out of our wagons, put it on board and ferried it across; then took our wagons and horses, and swam them across, and when they got to the opposite shore the brethren fastened ropes into the tongues of the wagons and helped the horses and wagons out of the river. Others felled trees and laid them across the river, and thus helped themselves over. In this way we all crossed in safety. Wednesday, the 28th, we reached the township of Decatur, where we lost another horse. Saturday the 31st, at night, we camped one mile from Jacksonville and prepared for the Sabbath.  \"On Sunday, June 1st, we had preaching all day, and many of the inhabitants of the town came out to hear. Brother John S. Carter preached in the morning. By this time the inhabitants began to flock down in companies to hear the preaching, as they understood we were professors of religion and had a meeting in the morning. Brother Joseph then proposed that some of the brethren should set forth different portions of the Gospel in their discourses. He called upon Brother Joseph Young to preach upon the principles of free salvation. He then called upon Brother Brigham Young to speak, who set forth baptism as essential to salvation. He was followed by Brother Orson Hyde, who proved by the scriptures that baptism was for the"]]]
