They composed weighty pamphlets, eloquent sermons, and sparkling satire in praise of the old order of things. When their cause was lost forever, they wrote gossipy letters from their exile in London or pathetic verses in their new home in Nova Scotia and Ontario. Their place in our national life and literature has never been filled, and their talents and virtues are never likely to receive adequate recognition. They took the wrong fork of the road.  There were gentle spirits, too, in this period, endowed with delicate literary gifts, but quite unsuited for the clash of  controversy--members, in Crèvecœur's touching words, of the \"secret communion among good men throughout the world.\" \"I am a lover of peace, what must I do?\" asks Crèvecœur in his Letters from an American Farmer. \"I was happy before this unfortunate Revolution. I feel that I am no longer so, therefore I regret the change. My heart sometimes seems tired with beating, it wants rest like my eyelids, which feel oppressed with so many watchings.\" Crèvecœur, an immigrant from Normandy, was certainly no weakling, but he felt that the great idyllic American adventure--which he described so captivatingly in his chapter entitled What is an American--was ending tragically in civil war. Another white-souled itinerant of that day was John Woolman of New Jersey, whose Journal, praised by Charles Lamb and Channing and edited by Whittier, is finding more readers in the twentieth century than it won in the nineteenth. \"A man unlettered,\" said Whittier, \"but with natural refinement and delicate sense of fitness, the purity of whose heart enters into his language.\" Woolman died at fifty-two in far-away York, England, whither he had gone to attend a meeting of the Society of Friends.  The three tall volumes of the Princeton edition of the poems of Philip Freneau bear the sub-title, \"Poet of the American Revolution.\" But our Revolution, in truth, never had an adequate poet. The prose-men, such as Jefferson, rose nearer the height of the great argument than did the men of rhyme. Here and there the struggle inspired a brisk ballad like Francis Hopkinson's Battle of the Kegs, a Hudibrastic satire like Trumbull's McFingal, or a patriotic song like Timothy Dwight's Columbia. Freneau painted from his own experience the horrors of the British prison-ship, and celebrated, in cadences learned from Gray and Collins, the valor of the men who fell at Eutaw Springs. There was patriotic verse in extraordinary profusion, but its literary value is slight, and it reveals few moods of the American mind that are not more perfectly conveyed through oratory, the pamphlet, and the political essay. The immediate models of this Revolutionary verse were the minor British bards of the eighteenth century, a century greatly given to verse-writing, but endowed by Heaven with the \"prose-reason\" mainly. The reader of Burton E. Stevenson's collection of Poems of American History can easily compare the contemporary verse inspired by the events of the Revolution with the modern verse upon the same historic themes. He will see how slenderly equipped for song were most of the later eighteenth-century Americans and how unfavorable to poetry was the tone of that hour.  Freneau himself suffered, throughout his long career, from the depressing indifference of his public to the true spirit of poetry. \"An old college mate of mine,\" said James Madison--who was by tradition Freneau's room-mate at Princeton in the class of 1771--\"a poet and man of literary and refined tastes, knowing nothing of the world.\" When but three years out of college, the cautious Madison wrote to another friend: \"Poetry wit and Criticism Romances Plays &c captivated me much: but I begin to discover that they deserve but a moderate portion of a mortal's Time and that something more substantial more durable more profitable befits our riper age.\" Madison was then at the ripe age of twenty-three! Professor Pattee, Freneau's editor, quotes these words to illustrate the \"common sense\" atmosphere of the age which proved fatal to Freneau's development. Yet the sturdy young New Yorker, of Huguenot descent, is a charming figure, and his later malevolence was shown only to his political foes. After leaving Princeton he tries teaching, the law, the newspaper, the sea; he is aflame with patriotic zeal; he writes, like most American poets, far too much for his own reputation. As the editor of the National Gazette in Philadelphia, he becomes involved in the bitter quarrel between his chief, Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton. His attachment to the cause of the French Revolution makes him publish baseless attacks upon Washington. By and by he retires to a New Jersey farm, still toying with journalism, still composing verses. He turns patriotic poet once more in the War of 1812; but the public has now forgotten him. He lives on in poverty and seclusion, and in his eightieth year loses his way in a snowstorm and perishes miserably--this in 1832, the year of the death of the great Sir Walter Scott, who once had complimented Freneau by borrowing one of his best lines of poetry.  It is in the orations and pamphlets and state papers inspired by the Revolutionary agitation that we find the most satisfactory expression of the thought and feeling of that generation. Its typical literature is civic rather than æsthetic, a sort of writing which has been incidental to the accomplishing of some political, social, or moral purpose, and which scarcely regards itself as literature at all. James Otis's argument against the Writs of Assistance in Massachusetts in 1761, and Patrick Henry's speech in the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765, mark epochs in the emotional life of these communities. They were reported imperfectly or not at all, but they can no more be ignored in an assessment of our national experience than editorials, sermons, or conversations which have expressed the deepest feelings of a day and then have perished beyond resurrection.  Yet if natural orators like Otis and Henry be denied a strictly \"literary\" rating because their surviving words are obviously inadequate to account for the popular effect of their speeches, it is still possible to measure the efficiency of the pamphleteer. When John Adams tells us that \"James Otis was Isaiah and Ezekiel united,\" we must take his word for the impression which Otis's oratory left upon his mind. But John Adams's own writings fill ten stout volumes which invite our judgment. The \"truculent and sarcastic splendor\" of his hyperboles need not blind us to his real literary excellencies, such as clearness, candor, vigor of phrase, freshness of idea. A testy, rugged, \"difficult\" person was John Adams, but he grew mellower with age, and his latest letters and journals are full of whimsical charm.  John Adams's cousin Samuel was not precisely a charming person. Bigoted, tireless, secretive, this cunning manipulator of political passions followed many tortuous paths. His ability for adroit misstatement of an adversary's position has been equaled but once in our history. But to the casual reader of his four volumes, Samuel Adams seems ever to be breathing the liberal air of the town-meeting: everything is as plainly obvious as a good citizen can make it. He has, too, the large utterance of the European liberalism of his day. \"Resolved,\" read his Resolutions of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts in 1765, \"that there are certain essential rights of the British constitution of government which are founded in the law of God and nature and are the common rights of mankind.\" In his statement of the Rights of the Colonists (1772) we are assured that \"among the natural rights of the colonists are these, First, a right to Life; secondly to Liberty; thirdly to Property.... All men have a Right to remain in a State of Nature as long as they please.... When Men enter into Society, it is by voluntary consent.\" Jean-Jacques himself could not be more bland, nor at heart more fiercely demagogic.  \"Tom\" Paine would have been no match for \"Sam\" Adams in a town-meeting, but he was an even greater pamphleteer. He had arrived from England in 1774, at the age of thirty-eight, having hitherto failed in most of his endeavors for a livelihood. \"Rebellious Staymaker; unkempt,\" says Carlyle; but General Charles Lee noted that there was \"genius in his eyes,\" and he bore a letter of introduction from Franklin commending him as an \"ingenious, worthy young man,\" which obtained for him a position on the Pennsylvania Magazine. Before he had been a year on American soil, Paine was writing the most famous pamphlet of our political literature, Common Sense, which appeared in January, 1776. \"A style hitherto unknown on this side of the Atlantic,\" wrote Edmund Randolph. Yet this style of familiar talk to the crowd had been used seventy years earlier by Defoe and Swift, and it was to be employed again by a gaunt American frontiersman who was born in 1809, the year of Thomas Paine's death. The Crisis, a series of thirteen pamphlets, of which the first was issued in December, 1776, seemed to justify the contemporary opinion that the \"American cause owed as much to the pen of Paine as to the sword of Washington.\" Paine, who was now serving in the army, might have heard his own words, \"These are the times that try men's souls,\" read aloud, by Washington's orders, to the ragged troops just before they crossed the Delaware to win the victory of Trenton. The best known productions of Paine's subsequent career, The Rights of Man and The Age of Reason, were written in Europe, but they were read throughout America. The reputation of the \"rebellious Staymaker\" has suffered from certain grimy habits and from the ridiculous charge of atheism. He was no more an atheist than Franklin or Jefferson. In no sense an original thinker, he could impart to outworn shreds of deistic controversy and to shallow"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34101"],["title","A Bilateral Division of the Parietal Bone in a Chimpanzee; with a Special (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net             _A Bilateral Division of the Parietal Bone        in a Chimpanzee; with a Special Reference        to the Oblique Sutures in the        Parietal._    By ALEŠ HRDLIČKA    AUTHOR'S EDITION, extracted from BULLETIN   OF THE   _American Museum of Natural History_,   VOL.

By ALEŠ HRDLIČKA.   The first to describe a case of division of the parietal bone in apes was Johannes Ranke, in 1899.[1] The skull in question is that of an adolescent female orang, one of 245 orang crania in the Selenka collection in the Munich Anthropological Institute. The abnormal suture divides the right parietal into an upper larger and a lower smaller portion. \"The suture runs nearly parallel with the sagittal suture,\" but, as the illustration shows (Fig. 1), it descends in its posterior extremity towards the temporo-parietal suture, and terminates in this a few millimetres in front of the lambdoid suture. The abnormal suture shows but little serration, and the articulation of the two divisions of the parietal bone is squamous in character, the lower portion overlapping the upper. Below the junction of the abnormal with the coronal suture, the latter takes a pronounced bend forward. A similar bend in the coronal suture is present in the same specimen on the left side. This is common among the other orang skulls in the collection. The portions of the coronal suture below and above the bend differ somewhat in character.  Besides the above-mentioned complete division, Ranke found among the 245 orang skulls 13 with incomplete division of the parietal bone. The division consisted invariably of a longer or shorter remnant of a horizontal \"parietal suture,\" ending in the coronal suture at the top of the bend above referred to. A similar anterior remnant of an abnormal parietal suture was found by Ranke in a young chimpanzee skull; but the author questions the word \"chimpanzee,\" which evidently means that the identity of the skull is somewhat doubtful.  In consequence of his finds, Ranke believes both complete and incomplete divisions in the parietal bone to be much more frequent in the orang than in man.[2] He also thinks that the bend usually present in the coronal suture in the orang signifies that, \"even where there are no traces of a parietal suture, such a suture has actually existed in an earlier stage of development.\" This implies the development of the adult parietal bone in the orang from two original segments, one above the other.  [Illustration: Fig. 1. Division of the Right Parietal in an Orang (Ranke, Abh. d. k. bayer. Akad. d. Wiss., II cl., XX Bd., ii Abth.).]  The divisions which I am about to describe occur, one in each parietal, in the skull of a nine-year-old male chimpanzee, which was captured, when young, in West Africa. Later on he was one of the attractions of the Barnum and Bailey Circus, and was familiarly known as Chico. The chimpanzee died in 1894, since when his skin and bones have been preserved in the American Museum of Natural History, New York City. Prof. J. A. Allen, the curator of the Zoölogical Department of the Museum, has kindly given me permission to describe the skeletal parts for publication.[3]  The most interesting part of Chico is unquestionably the skull. The divisions of the parietal bones which the specimen presents are not only the first complete divisions of the parietal observed in a chimpanzee, but are also unique in character, no divisions of the same nature having been observed before, either in man, in apes, or in monkeys. The position and extent of the divisions in this skull will throw considerable light on the question of the aberrant, complete divisions of the parietal bone, by which term may be designated divisions differing from the typical horizontal ones.  The skull under consideration shows in general a good development and an almost perfect symmetry. The capacity of the brain cavity, measured according to Flower's method, is 390 c.c.  The masculine features of this skull, and particularly the temporal ridges, are not quite as marked as those of another skull of an adolescent male chimpanzee in the Museum. The temporal ridges are slightly prominent, and in their middle third, over part of the frontal and the parietal bones, not more pronounced than in some human crania. They are, however, situated very high. Their upper lines or boundaries touch each other over a part of the sagittal suture, a little back of the bregma; while the lower lines approach to within 6 mm. of the sagittal suture. The supraorbital ridges are not very massive, although prominent to such a degree that, when the skull rests on the occipital condyles and on the teeth, the plane of the orbits is almost vertical. The sagittal crest is insignificant; the occipital crest is high, but not very massive. The zygomatic arches are less strong than they are in an average white male; and the mastoids are small, even smaller than in an average adult white female.  The second dentition is incomplete; the third molars have not reached the level of the opening of their sockets. The condition of the sutures, so far as their patency is concerned, does not bear the same relation to the stage of dentition as it does in man: all the sutures of this skull are more or less obliterated. There are no signs on any part of the skull that point to the closure of any of the sutures as premature. In detail, the condition of the sutures is as follows: The spheno-maxillary articulation is completely closed, but still plainly traceable. Of the various facial sutures, only remnants are open; the suture in the zygomatic arch, however, is almost fully patent on both sides. The spheno-frontal articulation is completely obliterated on the left, but traces of it remain on the right side. The left temporo-sphenoidal and squamo-frontal sutures (the squama of the temporal articulates with the frontal bone) are, with the exception of the basal part of the former, which remains open, quite obliterated, but on the right side both are open. The temporo-parietal sutures, with the exception of 8 mm. of the anterior end of the suture on the right side, are both entirely closed and hardly traceable. The coronal suture is partly open on the left, and wholly open on the right, up to a point a little below the middle of the anterior border of the parietal bone. At this point on each side, the lower portion of the coronal suture bends backward and continues as the anomalous suture; the upper portion of the coronal, particularly on the right, is completely obliterated, though still traceable. There are no signs left of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures, and only the basal portions of the temporo-occipital articulation remain. The palatine sutures, also, are entirely obliterated.  The skull shows no important anomalies besides the division of the parietals.  The divisions of the parietal bones begin on the left 32 mm., on the right 28 mm. (measured with a tape), above the point of junction of the coronal and temporo-parietal sutures. From the point where the anomalous sutures leave the coronal suture, to the bregma, the distance on the left is 44 mm., on the right 42 mm. The excess of size of the left over the right parietal bone along the coronal suture (6 mm.) compensates the greater height of that portion of the right temporal squama which articulates with the frontal bone. Measured across their middle from the temporo-parietal suture, the two parietals appear to be almost of equal size (left 82 mm., right 80 mm.). In an antero-posterior direction, from the beginning of the division to the middle of the parietal portion of the occipital crest, both bones measure the same, namely 75 mm.  The division in the left parietal begins at a V-shaped cleft, which is filled with a process of the frontal bone. There are slightly distinct markings on the bone and a number of insular ossicles, which make it probable that the cleft had been originally much greater and was largely filled by a Wormian or, rather, a fontanel bone, the lower border of which has subsequently united with the parietal.  For 30 mm. from its beginning the abnormal suture proceeds directly backward, and to this extent shows but little obliteration. The original cleft has, it seems, extended up to this point. From here the suture takes a slight bend upwards, and proceeds almost directly upwards and backwards, becoming gradually obliterated, until it disappears at the temporal ridge, 16 mm. from the median line. Originally the suture must have terminated on the posterior border of the parietal bone, not far from the lambda. The whole suture shows fairly good serration. The coronal suture on this side, below the division, shows serration about equal to that of the abnormal suture; the obliterated portion above this was, so far as can be seen, more simple.  [Illustration: Figs. 2-4. Skull of an Adolescent Male Chimpanzee.]  On the right side the division of the parietal may also have begun with a cleft in the anterior border of the bone, but, owing to the advanced state of obliteration of the upper portion of the coronal suture on this side, the existence of the cleft cannot be fully ascertained. Here also the abnormal suture, at first wholly open, runs for the first 26 mm. directly backwards; at this point the suture, still quite patent, takes a turn somewhat sharper than that on the left, and proceeds for 16 mm. backwards and upwards; here it takes a second turn, and proceeds almost directly upwards towards the sagittal suture. This last portion of the abnormal suture is considerably obliterated, and on and beyond the temporal ridge is scarcely traceable. The point at which the division has reached the sagittal "]]]
