If a definition does not come up to this standard it is insufficient. Anything beyond this requirement is certainly useless and probably mischievous.  Let the student define the following geographical terms, and let him also criticise the definitions offered by his fellow-students: Equator, poles, meridian, latitude, longitude, north, south, east, west.  Compare the following astronomical definitions with your geographical definitions, and criticise them in the same way. If you are not able to improve upon them, commit them to memory:  _The Poles_ of the heavens are those points in the sky toward which the earth's axis points. How many are there? The one near Polaris is called the north pole.  _The Celestial Equator_ is a great circle of the sky distant 90° from the poles.  _The Zenith_ is that point of the sky, overhead, toward which a plumb line points. Why is the word overhead placed in the definition? Is there more than one zenith?  _The Horizon_ is a great circle of the sky 90° distant from the zenith.  _An Hour Circle_ is any great circle of the sky which passes through the poles. Every star has its own hour circle.  _The Meridian_ is that hour circle which passes through the zenith.  _A Vertical Circle_ is any great circle that passes through the zenith. Is the meridian a vertical circle?  _The Declination_ of a star is its angular distance north or south of the celestial equator.  _The Right Ascension_ of a star is the angle included between its hour circle and the hour circle of a certain point on the equator which is called the _Vernal Equinox_. From spherical geometry we learn that this angle is to be measured either at the pole where the two hour circles intersect, as is done in the star map opposite page 124, or along the equator, as is done in the map opposite page 190. Right ascension is always measured from the vernal equinox in the direction opposite to that in which the stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e., from west toward east.  _The Altitude_ of a star is its angular distance above the horizon.  _The Azimuth_ of a star is the angle between the meridian and the vertical circle passing through the star. A star due south has an azimuth of 0°. Due west, 90°. Due north, 180°. Due east, 270°.  What is the azimuth of Polaris in degrees?  What is the azimuth of the sun at sunrise? At sunset? At noon? Are these azimuths the same on different days?  _The Hour Angle_ of a star is the angle between its hour circle and the meridian. It is measured from the meridian in the direction in which the stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e., from east toward west.  What is the hour angle of the sun at noon? What is the hour angle of Polaris when it is at the lowest point in its daily motion?  22. EXERCISES.--The student must not be satisfied with merely learning these definitions. He must learn to see these points and lines in his mind as if they were visibly painted upon the sky. To this end it will help him to note that the poles, the zenith, the meridian, the horizon, and the equator seem to stand still in the sky, always in the same place with respect to the observer, while the hour circles and the vernal equinox move with the stars and keep the same place among them. Does the apparent motion of a star change its declination or right ascension? What is the hour angle of the sun when it has the greatest altitude? Will your answer to the preceding question be true for a star? What is the altitude of the sun after sunset? In what direction is the north pole from the zenith? From the vernal equinox? Where are the points in which the meridian and equator respectively intersect the horizon?     CHAPTER III  FIXED AND WANDERING STARS   23. STAR MAPS.--Select from the map some conspicuous constellation that will be conveniently placed for observation in the evening, and make on a large scale a copy of all the stars of the constellation that are shown upon the map. At night compare this copy with the sky, and mark in upon your paper all the stars of the constellation which are not already there. Both the original drawing and the additions made to it by night should be carefully done, and for the latter purpose what is called the method of allineations may be used with advantage--i. e., the new star is in line with two already on the drawing and is midway between them, or it makes an equilateral triangle with two others, or a square with three others, etc.  A series of maps of the more prominent constellations, such as Ursa Major, Cassiopea, Pegasus, Taurus, Orion, Gemini, Canis Major, Leo, Corvus, Bootes, Virgo, Hercules, Lyra, Aquila, Scorpius, should be constructed in this manner upon a uniform scale and preserved as a part of the student's work. Let the magnitude of the stars be represented on the maps as accurately as may be, and note the peculiarity of color which some stars present. For the most part their color is a very pale yellow, but occasionally one may be found of a decidedly ruddy hue--e. g., Aldebaran or Antares. Such a star map, not quite complete, is shown in Fig. 13.  So, too, a sharp eye may detect that some stars do not remain always of the same magnitude, but change their brightness from night to night, and this not on account of cloud or mist in the atmosphere, but from something in the star itself. Algol is one of the most conspicuous of these _variable stars_, as they are called.  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Star map of the region about Orion.]  24. THE MOON'S MOTION AMONG THE STARS.--Whenever the moon is visible note its position among the stars by allineations, and plot it on the key map opposite page 190. Keep a record of the day and hour corresponding to each such observation. You will find, if the work is correctly done, that the positions of the moon all fall near the curved line shown on the map. This line is called the ecliptic.  After several such observations have been made and plotted, find by measurement from the map how many degrees per day the moon moves. How long would it require to make the circuit of the heavens and come back to the starting point?  On each night when you observe the moon, make on a separate piece of paper a drawing of it about 10 centimeters in diameter and show in the drawing every feature of the moon's face which you can see--e. g., the shape of the illuminated surface (phase); the direction among the stars of the line joining the horns; any spots which you can see upon the moon's face, etc. An opera glass will prove of great assistance in this work.  Use your drawings and the positions of the moon plotted upon the map to answer the following questions: Does the direction of the line joining the horns have any special relation to the ecliptic? Does the amount of illuminated surface of the moon have any relation to the moon's angular distance from the sun? Does it have any relation to the time at which the moon sets? Do the spots on the moon when visible remain always in the same place? Do they come and go? Do they change their position with relation to each other? Can you determine from these spots that the moon rotates about an axis, as the earth does? In what direction does its axis point? How long does it take to make one revolution about the axis? Is there any day and night upon the moon?  Each of these questions can be correctly answered from the student's own observations without recourse to any book.  25. THE SUN AND ITS MOTION.--Examine the face of the sun through a smoked glass to see if there is anything there that you can sketch.  By day as well as by night the sky is studded with stars, only they can not be seen by day on account of the overwhelming glare of sunlight, but the position of the sun among the stars may be found quite as accurately as was that of the moon, by observing from day to day its right ascension and declination, and this should be practiced at noon on clear days by different members of the class.  EXERCISE 10.--The right ascension of the sun may be found by observing with the sidereal clock the time of its transit over the meridian. Use the equation in § 20, and substitute in place of _U_ the value of the clock correction found from observations of stars on a preceding or following night. If the clock gains or loses _with respect to sidereal time_, take this into account in the value of _U_.  EXERCISE 11.--To determine the sun's declination, measure its altitude at the time it crosses the meridian. Use either the method of Exercise 4, or that used with Polaris in Exercise 8. The student should be able to show from Fig. 11 that the declination is equal to the sum of the altitude and the latitude of the place diminished by 90°, or in an equation      Declination = Altitude + Latitude - 90°.  If the declination as found from this equation is a negative number it indicates that the sun is on the south side of the equator.  The right ascension and declination of the sun as observed on each day should be plotted on the map and the date, written opposite it. If the work has been correctly done, the plotted points should fall upon the curved line (ecliptic) which runs lengthwise of the map. This line, in fact, represents the sun's path among the stars.  Note that the hours of right ascension increase from 0 up to 24, while the numbers on the clock dial go only from 0 to 12, and then repeat 0 to 12 again during the same day. When the sidereal time is 13 hours, 14 hours, etc., the clock will indicate 1 hour, 2 hours, etc., and 12 hours must then be added to the time shown on the dial.  If observations of the sun's right ascension and declination are made in the latter part of either March or September the student will find that the sun crosses the equator at these times, and he should determine from his observations, as accurately as possible, the date and hour of this crossing and the point on the equator at which the sun crosses it."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],["title","A Text-Book of Astronomy (#6)"],["body","points are called the equinoxes, Vernal Equinox and Autumnal Equinox for the spring and autumn crossings respectively, and the student will recall that the vernal equinox is the point from which right ascensions are measured. Its position among the stars is found by astronomers from observations like those above described, only made with much more elaborate apparatus.  Similar observations made in June and December show that the sun's midday altitude is about 47° greater in summer than in winter. They show also that the sun is as far north of the equator in June as he is south of it in December, from which it is easily inferred that his path, the ecliptic, is inclined to the equator at an angle of 23°.5, one half of 47°. This angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic. The student may recall that in the geographies the torrid zone is said to extend 23°.5 on either side of the earth's equator. Is there any connection between these limits and the obliquity of the ecliptic? Would it be correct to define the torrid zone as that part of the earth's surface within which the sun may at some season of the year pass through the zenith?  EXERCISE 12.--After a half dozen observations of the sun have been plotted upon the map, find by measurement the rate, in degrees per day, at which the sun moves along the ecliptic. How many days will be required for it to move completely around the ecliptic from vernal equinox back to vernal equinox again? Accurate observations with the elaborate apparatus used by professional astronomers show that this period, which is called a _tropical year_, is 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 46 seconds. Is this the same as the ordinary year of our calendars?  26. THE PLANETS.--Any one who has watched the sky and who has made the drawings prescribed in this chapter can hardly fail to have found in the course of his observations some bright stars not set down on the printed star maps, and to have found also that these stars do not remain fixed in position among their fellows, but wander about from one constellation to another. Observe the motion of one of these planets from night to night and plot its positions on the star map, precisely as was done for the moon. What kind of path does it follow?  Both the ancient Greeks and the modern Germans have called these bodies wandering stars, and in English we name them planets, which is simply the Greek word for wanderer, bent to our use. Besides the sun and moon there are in the heavens five planets easily visible to the naked eye and, as we shall see later, a great number of smaller ones visible only in the telescope. More than 2,000 years ago astronomers began observing the motion of sun, moon, and planets among the stars, and endeavored to account for these motions by the theory that each wandering star moved in an orbit about the earth. Classical and mediæval literature are permeated with this idea, which was displaced only after a long struggle begun by Copernicus (1543 A. D.), who taught that the moon alone of these bodies revolves about the earth, while the earth and the other planets revolve around the sun. The ecliptic is the intersection of the plane of the earth's orbit with the sky, and the sun appears to move along the ecliptic because, as the earth moves around its orbit, the sun is always seen projected against the opposite side of it. The moon and planets all appear to move near the ecliptic because the planes of their orbits nearly coincide with the plane of the earth's orbit, and a narrow strip on either side of the ecliptic, following its course completely around the sky, is called the _zodiac_, a word which may be regarded as the name of a narrow street (16° wide) within which all the wanderings of the visible planets are confined and outside of which they never venture. Indeed, Mars is the only planet which ever approaches the edge of the street, the others traveling near the middle of the road.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--The apparent motion of a planet.]  27. A TYPICAL CASE OF PLANETARY MOTION.--The Copernican theory, enormously extended and developed through the Newtonian law of gravitation (see Chapter IV), has completely supplanted the older Ptolemaic doctrine, and an illustration of the simple manner in which it accounts for the apparently complicated motions of a planet among the stars is found in Figs. 14 and 15, the first of which represents the apparent motion of the planet Mars through the constellations Aries and Pisces during the latter part of the year 1894, while the second shows the true motions of Mars and the earth in their orbits about the sun during the same period. The straight line in Fig. 14, with cross ruling upon it, is a part of the ecliptic, and the numbers placed opposite it represent the distance, in degrees, from the vernal equinox. In Fig. 15 the straight line represents the direction from the sun toward the vernal equinox, and the angle which this line makes with the line joining earth and sun is called the earth's longitude. The imaginary line joining the earth and sun is called the earth's radius vector, and the pupil should note that the longitude and length of the radius vector taken together show the direction and distance of the earth from the sun--i. e., they fix the relative positions of the two bodies. The same is nearly true for Mars and would be wholly true if the orbit of Mars lay in the same plane with that of the earth. How does Fig. 14 show that the orbit of Mars does not lie exactly in the same plane with the orbit of the earth?  EXERCISE 13.--Find from Fig. 15 what ought to have been the apparent course of Mars among the stars during the period shown in the two figures, and compare what you find with Fig. 14. The apparent position of Mars among the stars is merely its direction from the earth, and this direction is represented in Fig. 14 by the distance of the planet from the ecliptic and by its longitude.  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--The real motion of a planet.]  The longitude of Mars for each date can be found from Fig. 15 by measuring the angle between the straight line _S V_ and the line drawn from the earth to Mars. Thus for October 12th we may find with the protractor that the angle between the line _S V_ and the line joining the earth to Mars is a little more than 30°, and in Fig. 14 the position of Mars for this date is shown nearly opposite the cross line corresponding to 30° on the ecliptic. Just how far below the ecliptic this position of Mars should fall can not be told from Fig. 15, which from necessity is constructed as if the orbits of Mars and the earth lay in the same plane, and Mars in this case would always appear to stand exactly on the ecliptic and to oscillate back and forth as shown in Fig. 14, but without the up-and-down motion there shown. In this way plot in Fig. 14 the longitudes of Mars as seen from the earth for other dates and observe how the forward motion of the two planets in their orbits accounts for the apparently capricious motion of Mars to and fro among the stars.  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.]  28. THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS.--Each planet, great or small, moves in its own appropriate orbit about the sun, and the exact determination of these orbits, their sizes, shapes, positions, etc., has been one of the great problems of astronomy for more than 2,000 years, in which successive generations of astronomers have striven to push to a still higher degree of accuracy the knowledge attained by their predecessors. Without attempting to enter into the details of this problem we may say, generally, that every planet moves in a plane passing through the sun, and for the six planets visible to the naked eye these planes nearly coincide, so that the six orbits may all be shown without much error as lying in the flat surface of one map. It is, however, more convenient to use two maps, such as Figs. 16 and 17, one of which shows the group of planets, Mercury, Venus, the earth, and Mars, which are near the sun, and on this account are sometimes called the inner planets, while the other shows the more distant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, together with the earth, whose orbit is thus made to serve as a connecting link between the two diagrams. These diagrams are accurately drawn to scale, and are intended to be used by the student for accurate measurement in connection with the exercises and problems which follow.  In addition to the six planets shown in the figures the solar system contains two large planets and several hundred small ones, for the most part invisible to the naked eye, which are omitted in order to avoid confusing the diagrams.  29. JUPITER AND SATURN.--In Fig. 16 the sun at the center is encircled by the orbits of the three planets, and inclosing all of these is a circular border showing the directions from the sun of the constellations which lie along the zodiac. The student must note carefully that it is only the directions of these constellations that are correctly shown, and that in order to show them at all they have been placed very much too close to the sun. The cross lines extending from the orbit of the earth toward the sun with Roman numerals opposite them show the positions of the earth in its orbit on the first day of January (_I_), first day of February (_II_), etc., and the similar lines attached to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn with Arabic numerals show the positions of those planets on the first day of January of each year indicated, so that the figure serves to show not only the orbits of the planets, but their actual positions in their orbits for something more than the first decade of the twentieth century.  The line drawn from the sun toward the right of the figure shows the direction to the vernal equinox. It forms one side of the angle which measures a planet's longitude.
