The case of the spotted skunk deserves brief commentary. This species was not taken or observed by members of our field parties and local residents made no claim to its presence except for a few vague recollections of spotted skunks having been seen \"years ago.\" Visher (1914:91), however, reported that _Spilogale_ was much commoner than _Mephitis_ in the early part of the century. However that may have been, _Spilogale putorius_, as currently understood, would be judged to be a widespread species except that recent evidence strongly suggests that the plains race (_interrupta_) is not of the same species as spotted skunks to the west (subspecies _gracilis_). Furthermore, the ranges of the two are not in contact. Whatever its ultimate specific affinities may be, _S. p. interrupta_ clearly is a plains mammal, and thus is here considered in that zoogeographic unit.  _Sonoran species._--_Sylvilagus audubonii_, _Dipodomys ordii_, _Reithrodontomys megalotis_, and _Onychomys leucogaster_ are invaders to the Northern Great Plains from the Sonoran region to the southwest. The latter two, however, are rather broadly distributed on the Great Plains and their assignment as Sonoran species is somewhat arbitrary. It is of interest that as many as nine mammals with southwestern affinities occur as far north as southwestern South Dakota and adjacent Wyoming.  _Eastern species._--Only _Sylvilagus floridanus_ and _Peromyscus leucopus_ can be identified as species primarily associated with the eastern deciduous forest. The former is limited in northwestern South Dakota to brushy habitats in riparian communities, whereas _P. leucopus_ is restricted to relatively good stands of deciduous timber and presently is known to occur only in Deer Draw of the Slim Buttes.  Throughout its known range in the western part of the Northern Great Plains, _P. leucopus_ is represented by small and disjunct populations associated with riparian deciduous timber. The known population nearest to Harding County is on the Black Hills to the south; next nearest are several isolated or semi-isolated populations along the Yellowstone River in eastern Montana. Presumably, this white-footed mouse spread northwestward into the western part of the plains region along river systems, in company with deciduous trees, in some post-glacial period when the climate was warmer and wetter than now. Subsequent drying altered substantially the distribution and perhaps composition of riparian forests, and isolated populations of _P. leucopus_ evidently survived only in restricted areas, such as Deer Draw, many of them probably marginal habitat for the species.  _Unverified species._--If the 10 species listed as of \"unverified occurrence,\" it seems highly likely that as many as eight will be found to occur, or occurred within historic time, in Harding County. Among these eight are one steppe species (_Vulpes velox_), three with boreomontane affinities (_Sorex cinereus_, _Gulo gulo_, and _Lynx canadensis_), two (_Sciurus niger_ and _Urocyon cinereoargenteus_) that are associated with the eastern deciduous forests, and two (_Sorex merriami_ and _Lagurus curtatus_) that are Great Basin elements.  It is noteworthy that the last-mentioned faunal unit is not known to be represented in northwestern South Dakota.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  For assistance in the field, we are especially grateful to the students who were enrolled in the Field Course in Vertebrate Zoology at The University of Kansas in the summers of 1961, 1965, and 1970, and to M. A. Levy, R. R. Patterson, and T. H. Swearingen. In 1965 and 1970, the summer field course was supported in part by grants (GE-7739 and GZ-1512, respectively) from the National Science Foundation; Andersen was supported in the field in 1968 by a grant from the Kansas City Council for Higher Education. Personnel of the U.S. Forest Service (Sioux Division, Custer National Forest), particularly District Ranger Timothy S. Burns, were most helpful to us in the field, as were Wardens Wesley Broer and Merritt Paukarbek of the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks. Robert Kriege, Federal predator control agent stationed in Buffalo, was most generous in sharing with us his knowledge of rodents and carnivores in the area, and many present or former residents, particularly Carl Cornell and Spike Jorgensen, also provided useful information and were helpful in other ways.  Ectoparasites reported here were identified by Cluff E. Hopla (fleas), Richard B. Loomis (chiggers), and Glen M. Kohls (ticks). Other than mammals housed in the Museum of Natural History, we examined only three, two in the U.S. National Museum (USNM) and one in the collection at South Dakota State University, Brookings (SDSU).

WARD                    AUTHOR OF \"THE NEW SENIOR AT ANDOVER,\"                    \"THE MASTER OF THE MAGICIANS,\" ETC.     NEW YORK   TAIT, SONS & COMPANY   Union Square    Copyright, 1891.   BY HERBERT D. WARD.     A REPUBLIC WITHOUT A PRESIDENT.     PART I.     On the morning of the eighth of June, 1893, at about ten o'clock, crowds were seen clustered in front of the daily newspaper bulletins in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Boston. The excitement rivalled that occasioned by the assassination of Garfield, and by night the country was as bewildered and aghast as when the news came that Lincoln was murdered. This was the announcement as it appeared in blood-red, gigantic capitals by the door of the New York _Tribune_ building:      UNPRECEDENTED CALAMITY!      AWFUL MYSTERY!      THE PRESIDENT AND HIS WIFE SPIRITED AWAY FROM     THE WHITE HOUSE!      TWO SERVANTS FOUND GAGGED!      NOT A TRACE OF THE DISTINGUISHED COUPLE!      THE COUNTRY AGHAST AT THE DREADFUL POSSIBILITIES     OF THIS DISAPPEARANCE!  Extras found enormous sales, but they contained no more news than this. Business was brought to a standstill and stocks fell in half an hour from five to twenty per cent. The land was convulsed. It was true that there were those who thought the whole thing a colossal hoax perpetrated by the defeated party. But as time went on the startling and incredible news was confirmed. The evening edition of the New York _Sun_ had these ominous headers.      THE PRESIDENT AND HIS WIFE HAVE ACTUALLY DISAPPEARED.      THE GAGGED SERVANTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE TELL     THEIR STORY.      THEY ARE IN PRISON ON GRAVE SUSPICION OF CONSPIRACY.      THE CARD OF AN EMINENT POLITICIAN FOUND IN THE     VESTIBULE OF THE EXECUTIVE MANSION.      IS A DARK POLITICAL PLOT ABOUT TO BE UNEARTHED?  The next day found the situation unchanged. Rumors of every description ran wild. Telegrams of condolence from all the sovereigns of the world were received at Washington by the dazed Department of State. These were fully given to the omnivorous press. By order of the Vice-President, all other news was for the present rigorously withheld from publication. To this censorship the press submitted cordially. Mystery was brooding over the land, and despair laughed detectives in the face. Men met each other and asked only this question:  \"Have they been found?\"  A sad shake of the head always followed.  \"No wonder,\" the Governor of Massachusetts was heard to say, \"with thousands of assassins coming over here every year. Even our President was not safe. God help our country!\"  At the end of a few days the full news, as far as it went, was published, and the nation then drew its second breath. The facts about this stupendous abduction, as given to the public by the end of the week, were briefly these: This is the affidavit of the night sentry, who was stationed in the vestibule of the White House.  \"My name is George Henry. I am thirty-four years old. I was born in this country. My father was a slave. It was about one-thirty last night when I was aroused by a double rap at the main entrance. I was not asleep, but I may have been a little sleepy. I asked who was there, and a voice answered that the Secretary of State wished to see the President on business of the greatest importance. I answered that the President was in bed. He said that he must see the President immediately. Then I thought I recognized the voice of Mr. Secretary. I opened the door and, sure enough, Mr. Secretary entered. He had on a silk hat and the gray overcoat he usually wears. He gave me his card, and told me to take it right up to the President. The door was left open and I noticed it was raining. The carriage of the Secretary was standing under the portico. I did not see the coachman. When I bowed and turned to go upstairs there was a strange smell in the air, and I remember nothing more.\"  The cross-examination brought out from the prisoner, who seemed to answer honestly and intelligently, that he was sure it was the Secretary of State, but his voice seemed changed by a cold. He felt positive about the carriage, for he recognized the team, a gray and a black. He heard no voices outside. When chloroform was produced, he said that was the same smell, but there was something more that was considerably tarter. He persisted in the same story, and repeated it over and over without variation. It looked dubious for his excellency the Secretary of State.  The next witness was the night sentry on the second floor. He was badly frightened, was a little confused, but told a straight story. His deposition was as follows:  \"Yes, sah, my name is Frank Steven. I have alluz been a colored man. I was bahn in Ohio when I was twelve years old.\" [At this juncture a glass of ice water restored the equilibrium of the witness.] \"I moved to Ohio when I was twelve years old. I was born in Mississipy. I'm forty-two now, I think. It might have been half after one or two when I heard a step a-coming up the stairs. I went to the landing and saw Mr. Secretary of State a-coming up with his hat on; and how he got there the Lawd only knows. He told me to show him to Mr. President's room. He spoke mighty sharp, and I thought it was all right, so I led the way. When I was a-going to knock at Mr. President's door, he told me to stop and have a cigar first. He never offered me one before, and I was mighty surprised. There was a strange smell, like an apothecary store and I don't know anything more about it. That is all I know, sir.\"  Subsequent examination brought out no new fact, except that the prisoner remembered that the Secretary coughed behind a handkerchief as he spoke, and that one hand was concealed under his gray overcoat; this was pulled over his ears. The thing that struck him most was that the Secretary kept his hat on during the whole interview. The watchman had never known him to keep his hat on in the house before. Like the first witness, he recognized the odor of chloroform, and thought there was something else besides. He was surprised to find himself gagged and bound when he came to.  As the two witnesses corroborated each other, and as neither had any communication with the other, they were substantially believed. The fact that this testimony was indisputably damaging to the Secretary of State, and the further circumstantial evidence of his card having been recovered from the floor of the lower vestibule, caused the investigating committee, of which Inspector Byrnes was the chairman, rigorously to exclude all reporters, lest the evidence might make it, to say the least, uncomfortable for the suspected dignitary. It was natural that, by ten o'clock on the morning of the drama, a secret guard should be placed over the head of the Department of State, though no movement was made as yet toward his arrest.  The next witness of importance was the President's valet, who swore that the President retired unusually early that night and dismissed him with the special injunction that the house should be kept quiet, as the President had a headache and wished perfect rest.  It may be well to state here that the new incumbent of the presidential chair shared with his wife the traditions of Jeffersonian simplicity of living, and that they departed so little from their original home habits that house detectives were abolished, and the distinguished pair lived, entertained, and slept with as scant formality as the sovereign people allowed. The doors communicating with their sleeping apartments were rarely locked. Full dependence for safety was placed upon the two trusted watchmen whose deposition has been given.  The children and their attendants, who slept in adjacent rooms, heard no noise during the night. In short, none but the two under strict arrest were aware of the entrance of any person or persons after twelve o'clock. In the meanwhile, detectives were stationed unostentatiously throughout the White House, watching with professional acuteness the movements of everyone within its doors.  At eleven o'clock precisely on the morning of the ninth of June, Inspector Byrnes and the chief of the Washington police drove up in a hack to the door of the Secretary's mansion, and requested a private interview. Within was feverish commotion. Senators and Representatives, public officials and men of eminence were sending in their cards and excitedly discussing the dreadful news. Telegrams were beginning to pour in. The first impression was confirmed that a political coup or revenge was at the bottom of the shocking affair, and whispers were mysteriously exchanged between sombre and stately heads.  When the Secretary saw the cards he immediately withdrew, with an aside to the Secretary of War: \"This visit may clear up some of the mystery.\" These words were not calculated to soothe the impatience of the inner circle.  When the three were alone in the private office, the chief of the Washington police force tersely opened the subject. He was a blunt official of adamantine integrity, a veteran of the war.  \"Mr. Secretary,\" he began, \"this is the saddest day the country has known for many a year. You must pardon me if I ask you a few leading questions.\"  Inspector Byrnes sat with his back to the light; for, with an inimitable fashion of his own, he had, upon entering, made a debouch between two chairs and a table, forcing the Secretary to sit with his face to the glare of the window. Shaded himself he could with impunity watch the least expression on the sensitive and noble countenance before him.  \"Sir, do you recognize this card?\" The question came like a musket shot, and a card dropped, face upwards, on the Secretary's knee. Kellar could not have performed this feat more neatly.  The Secretary glanced at the pasteboard for a moment, and said in evident surprise:  \"Why, yes. It is one of my cards.\"  \"Have you any"]]]
