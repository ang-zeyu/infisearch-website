In short, in arranging _muralis_ as a subspecies of _Thomomys bottae_, we are influenced, not by the demonstration of intergradation, but by the degree of morphological differentiation of the population and the probable reasons therefor.   ~Thomomys bottae mutabilis~ Goldman  Goldman (Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., 28:342, July 15, 1938) named the subspecies _Thomomys bottae pinalensis_ on the basis of only one specimen, an immature female (245709 BS) from Oak Flat, five miles east of Superior, Pinal Mountains, Arizona. Examination shows it to be indistinguishable in characters of taxonomic importance (coloration, external measurements, shape of skull and size of skull) from specimens of _T. b. mutabilis_ of comparable sex and age. No. 245709 is well within the limits of individual variation of _T. b. mutabilis_ as is shown by the several specimens (all in the U. S. Biological Surveys Collection) as follow: Nos. 214118, 214670 (topotypes from Camp Verde, Arizona), 212707 (Chiricahua Ranch, 20 mi. E Calva), 208635 (H-bar Ranch, 20 mi. S Payson), and 215762 (Turkey Creek). Therefore, the name _Thomomys bottae pinalensis_ is here arranged as a synonym of the earlier name, _Thomomys bottae mutabilis_ Goldman (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 46:75, April 27, 1933), the type locality of which is Camp Verde, Yavapai County, Arizona.   ~Thomomys bottae patulus~ Goldman  When Goldman (Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., 26:113, March 15, 1936) named the subspecies _Thomomys bottae desitus_, he assigned to it (_op. cit._:114) 10 specimens obtained at Wickenburg, Maricopa County, Arizona. He did not mention specimens from Wickenburg when he subsequently named the subspecies _Thomomys bottae patulus_ (Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., 28:341, July 15, 1938) and stated that _T. b. patulus_ was known only from the type locality in the \"bottomland along [the] Hassayampa River, two miles below Wickenburg.\" Examination in 1950 of specimens referable to _T. b. patulus_ in the U. S. Biological Surveys Collection shows all of them, including the holotype, to be labeled \"Wickenburg.\" The 10 specimens from Wickenburg reported by Goldman in 1936 as _T. b. desitus_ were included by him among the 16 (actually 17, one being a skull only) upon which he based his description of _T. b. patulus_ in 1938. Examination of the field catalogues of 3 of the 4 collectors who obtained the specimens discloses that only the 7 specimens obtained last were recorded as occurring in the Hassayampa River bottoms; the first 10 were recorded only as from \"Wickenburg.\" Briefly, only one subspecies, _T. b. patulus_, is present in the area, and Goldman in 1938 seems to have thought that the two localities were actually the same, and that \"2 miles below Wickenburg\" was the more precise designation.   ~Thomomys bottae providentialis~ Grinnell  We have examined a specimen, No. 26120/33526, from 12-Mile Spring, California, in the U. S. Biological Surveys Collection, which Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:73, November 15, 1945) referred to the subspecies _Thomomys perpallidus_ [= _aureus_] _perpes_. We find the specimen to be referable to the later named _Thomomys bottae providentialis_ on the basis of smaller ear, more massive, more ridged and angular skull, greater interorbital breadth, deeper and thicker rostrum, less globular bullae, and U-shaped rather than V-shaped interpterygoid space. Therefore, 12-Mile Spring is the northernmost locality of occurrence of the subspecies _T. b. providentialis_.   ~Thomomys bottae sanctidiegi~ Huey  In his discussion of the pocket gophers of Baja California, Huey (Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 10:245-268, map, August 31, 1945) made no mention of specimens from Ensenada, Baja California, recorded by Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:58, November 15, 1915) as _Thomomys bottae nigricans_. We have examined the specimens from Ensenada available to Bailey in the U. S. Biological Surveys Collection, Nos. 137724, 139890, and 139891, subadult, immature, and adult, respectively. As compared with _Thomomys bottae sanctidiegi_ from the mouth of the Tiajuana River (No. 126028) and _T. b. nigricans_ (topotypes), the one adult specimen from Ensenada agrees with _T. b. sanctidiegi_ and differs from _T. b. nigricans_ in lighter color, larger and more angular skull, and more inflated braincase. The specimens from Ensenada differ from the adjacent subspecies to the south, _Thomomys bottae proximarinus_ [to judge from Huey's (_op. cit._) characterization of that subspecies] in lighter color, and larger, more robust skull. Accordingly, the specimens from Ensenada are referred to _Thomomys bottae sanctidiegi_.   ~Thomomys bottae siccovallis~ Huey  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:58, November 15, 1915) listed a specimen from Mattomi, Baja California, as _Thomomys bottae nigricans_. When Huey (Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 10:259, August 31, 1945) revived the name _Thomomys_ [_bottae_] _aphrastus_ Elliot, and named (_op. cit._:258) _Thomomys bottae siccovallis_ he made no mention of the specimen, from Mattomi, which, on geographic grounds, would be expected to be _T. b. aphrastus_, _T. b. martirensis_ J. A. Allen, or _T. b. siccovallis_. We have examined an adult male (10832 CNHM), probably the specimen seen by Bailey (_loc. cit._), from Mattomi, and have compared No. 10832 with six topotypes (10813-10816, 10819 and 10820 CNHM) of _T. b. martirensis_, the type and one topotype (10798 CNHM) of _T. b. aphrastus_ and with the original description of _T. b. siccovallis_. The specimen from Mattomi seems to be unique in the large size of the tympanic bullae. The specimen in question differs from _T. b. martirensis_ also in shorter and wider skull, shorter and wider rostrum, and longer and wider molariform teeth. In these features resemblance is shown to the holotype of _T. b. aphrastus_ and even greater resemblance is shown to _T. b. siccovallis_ to which the specimen from Mattomi is referred.   ~Thomomys monticola mazama~ Merriam  This subspecies of the Cascades of Oregon and _Thomomys monticola nasicus_ of the territory immediately to the east of the Cascades, in the same state, were originally described (Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 11:214 and 216, respectively, July 15, 1897) and redescribed (Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 39:123 and 125, respectively, November 15, 1915) as distinguished from each other by paler color, smaller tympanic bullae and longer nasals in _T. m. nasicus_. The holotypes do differ in these respects. The assigned (by Bailey, _loc. cit._) specimens indicate that the opposite condition obtains with respect to the size of bullae; that is to say, the bullae are smaller in _T. m. mazama_. In these referred specimens from Oregon the nasals are actually and relatively longer in _T. m. nasicus_, which averages paler (less black and more red). Certain specimens of the two subspecies that are comparable as to sex, age and season, are indistinguishable in color.  This is the background against which Bailey (_op. cit._:125), contrary to his statement of geographic ranges (_op. cit._:123, 125) and map (_op. cit._:fig. 5, p. 23), assigned, in his list of specimens examined, two specimens ([** Male] ad. 79817 and [** Female] ad. 79818 BS) from Pengra, west of the Cascades, to the subspecies _T. m. nasicus_. In the specimens from Pengra the bullae are angular as in referred specimens of _nasicus_ (unlike those of the holotype), the rostra are intermediate in length between those of the two subspecies concerned, and the color is light as in _T. m. nasicus_ but can be matched by that of certain specimens of _T. m. mazama_, for example by that of No. 79821 BS from Diamond Lake, Oregon. Consequently, on morphological grounds, the two specimens from Pengra can be assigned to _T. m. mazama_ almost as well as to _T. m. nasicus_. Having regard for the geographic relations, we assign them to _T. m. mazama_.  In making this tentative identification we are aware that the acquisition of more nearly adequate material from Oregon, and critical study of such material, may bring a subspecific arrangement of the populations of _Thomomys monticola_ different from the current one.   ~Thomomys talpoides bullatus~ Bailey  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:101, November 15, 1915) identified as _Thomomys talpoides clusius_ two specimens (66465 and 66523 BS) from Pass (= Parkman) and one specimen (66464 BS) from Dayton, in Wyoming. We have examined these specimens and find that they lack the broad braincase and narrow nasals of _clusius_ and in these and in other features the three specimens resemble _T. t. caryi_ and _T. t. bullatus_ more than they resemble any other named kinds. Although structurally, and in color, intermediate between the two subspecies named immediately above, the specimens show greater resemblance (large size and narrow braincase) to the latter and are referred by us to _Thomomys talpoides bullatus_.   ~Thomomys talpoides clusius~ Coues  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:102, November 15, 1915) identified as _Thomomys talpoides bullatus_ an adult male (147347 BS) from the J. K. Ranch, 5900 ft., on Meadow Creek, Wind River, Wyoming [= Wind River of Bailey, _loc. cit._] and a young female (168666 BS) from Sage Creek, 8 mi. NW Fort Washakie, Wyoming. The rosaceous tone of these pale individuals is more as in some populations of _T. t. ocius_ and _T. t. clusius_ to the southward. Also, the skull of the male, although large, is distinctly narrower than in _T. t. bullatus_ and we think shows the influence of the _T. t. tenellus_ stock. All features considered, we refer the specimens to _T. t. clusius_.   ~Thomomys talpoides glacialis~ Dalquest and Scheffer  Vernon Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:119, November 15, 1915) listed 19 specimens from Roy, Washington, as _Thomomys douglasi yelmensis_ Merriam. Our examination of 26 specimens (205039-205051, 205072-205077, and 206545-206551 BS) labeled as \"Roy,\" and presumably including those listed by Bailey (_l"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33578"],["title","Comments on the Taxonomy and Geographic Distribution of Some North American (#5)"],["body","oc. cit._), leads us to identify all 26 as _Thomomys talpoides glacialis_ on the basis of widely spreading zygomatic arches and decidedly ochraceous hue of underparts.   ~Geomys bursarius jugossicularis~ Hooper  Seven skins with skulls (35104/47369-35110/47375 BS) from Las Animas, Colorado, probably formed the basis for Cary's (N. Amer. Fauna, 33:129, August 17, 1911) record of _Geomys lutescens_ from that locality. Comparison of the material reveals that the animals are referable instead to the later named subspecies, _Geomys lutescens jugossicularis_ Hooper (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 420:1, June 28, 1940), on the basis of (1) more reddish color, (2) deeper zygomatic plate, (3) shorter jugal as expressed as a percentage of the length of the part of the zygomatic arch anterior to the jugal, and (4) larger area of inner face of jugal exposed when skull is viewed from directly above. Possibly it is noteworthy that the specimens from Las Animas are larger than Hooper's holotype and one topotype; this larger size is indicative of intergradation with _G. b. lutescens_ as represented by the specimens examined by us from Pueblo.  Our examination of an adult female, No. 128242 BS and a juvenal female, No. 128243 BS, from 15 mi. E Texline, Texas, recorded by Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 25:132, October 24, 1905) under the name _Geomys lutescens_ reveals that the specimens are referable to _Geomys bursarius jugossicularis_ instead of to _Geomys bursarius major_ on the basis of (1) mastoid part of tympanic bulla more inflated posteriorly, (2) narrowness of frontals between posterior tongues of the premaxillae and, (3) lighter color.   ~Liomys irroratus irroratus~ Gray  When Hooper and Handley (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 514:1-34, October 29, 1948) published a revised map (_op. cit._:3) showing the geographic distribution of the subspecies of _Liomys irroratus_ they did not mention a specimen from Agusinapa, Guerrero, which inferentially from their map would be _L. i. irroratus_ although it previously had been recorded as _L. i. torridus_ by Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 34:55, September 7, 1911). We have examined the specimen (70228 BS), which retains the upper deciduous premolar. Its long foot (32 mm.) and broad cranium (13 mm.) are the bases for identifying the specimen as _Liomys irroratus irroratus_ instead of _L. i. minor_, which is smaller.   ~Liomys irroratus minor~ Merriam  When Hooper and Handley (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 514:1-34, October 29, 1948) published a revised map (_op. cit._:3) showing the geographic distribution of the subspecies of _Liomys irroratus_ they did not mention five specimens from Tlapa, Guerrero, which inferentially from their map would be _L. i. irroratus_ although these specimens previously had been recorded as _L. i. torridus_ by Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 34:55, September 7, 1911). We have examined the five specimens (70221-70225 BS), three of which retain the upper deciduous premolars and two of which have the upper fourth premolar unworn. The short, wide rostrum is unlike the long slender rostrum of topotypes of _L. i. torridus_ of comparable age, and agrees with the condition in topotypes of _L. i. minor_ of comparable age. It is on this basis of wider rostrum that we refer the five specimens from Tlapa to _Liomys i. minor_ which Hooper and Handley (_op. cit._:13) described as differing from the geographically adjacent _L. i. irroratus_ in \"short and strongly tapered rostrum.\" We would add that we have not independently verified this difference between _L. i. minor_ and _L. i. irroratus_ for want of specimens of _L. i. irroratus_ comparable in age to the five individuals from Tlapa.  The map of Hooper and Handley (_loc. cit._) inferentially excludes Tlalixtaquilla, Guerrero, from the geographic range of _L. i. minor_ (and places Tlalixtaquilla within the range of _L. i. irroratus_) although Goldman (_op. cit._:56) previously had identified specimens from this place as _L. i. minor_. Our examination of the two immature specimens (70227 and 70230 BS) from Tlalixtaquilla reveals that they closely resemble the holotype of _L. i. minor_ and leads to the conclusion that they are _Liomys irroratus minor_.   ~Perognathus amplus pergracilis~ Goldman  When Bole (Sci. Publ. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5(2):6, December 4, 1937) named and described _Perognathus longimembris salinensis_, he listed as comparative material of _P. l. bangsi_, a specimen in the Museum of Comparative Zoology from Parker, Yuma Co., Arizona. There was some reason to doubt the identification of the specimen since it is the only record of occurrence of the subspecies from east of the Colorado River. There is no specimen of _Perognathus longimembris_ from Arizona in the Museum of Comparative Zoology. There is one specimen of pocket mouse (18213, a skin only) from 30 miles east of Parker. We think that this is the specimen seen by Bole because at one time according to the label, it had been identified as _Perognathus panamintinus_ [= _longimembris_] _bangsi_. If the identification of this skin-only had been made by means of Osgood's key (N. Amer. Fauna, 18:14-15, September 20, 1900), the animal would have \"keyed out\" to _P. longimembris_ because the total length is recorded on the label as 130. Seth B. Benson has subsequently examined the specimen. The label now bears in handwriting the name of _P. amplus pergracilis_ and is followed by Benson's initials as the identifier. Although we lack adequate comparative material, we consider the specimen to be _P. amplus pergracilis_ Goldman, because the skin answers well to the description of _P. a. pergracilis_ and because of the name currently on the label with Benson's initials.   ~Perognathus longimembris panamintinus~ Merriam  In the current literature, Californian specimens of the little pocket mouse stand identified as _Perognathus longimembris nevadensis_ from Oasis and vicinity of Benton Station (Grinnell, Univ. California Publ. Zool., 40:147, September 26, 1933). When one of us (Hall, Mammals of Nevada, p. 360, July 1, 1946) reported specimens from southwestern Nevada as _Perognathus longimembris panamintinus_ he did so on the basis of study of specimens which included those from Oasis (in the California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology) that he at that time (in ms.) identified as _P. l. panamintinus_. Those specimens from Oasis have the hair on the underparts white all the way to the base as also do specimens from Morans, 5000 ft. (29583/41638 BS), in contrast to the plumbeous underparts of _P. l. nevadensis_. It is on this basis that we identify specimens from the places mentioned above as _Perognathus longimembris panamintinus_. \"Vicinity of Benton Station\" as given by Grinnell (_loc. cit._) is interpreted to include Morans, Mono County.   ~Dipodomys agilis martirensis~ Huey  Elliot (Field Columb. Mus., Zool. Ser., Publ. 79, 3(12):221, August 15, 1903) referred specimens from Rosarito and Rosarito Divide, San Pedro Mártir Mts., Baja California, to _Perodipus_ [= _Dipodomys_] _agilis_. According to the currently known distribution of _Dipodomys agilis_ in Baja California (see Huey, Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 11:237, April 30, 1951), the specimens seemed likely to belong to the subspecies _D. a. martirensis_. An examination of the specimens (10644, 10690-10693 CMNH from Rosarito, and 10694 from Rosarito Divide) shows that, on the basis of large ear and comparatively narrow braincase, they are in fact referable to _D. a. martirensis_. Only No. 10693, with its broader braincase, seems atypical. Comparative materials used are in the Chicago Natural History Museum as follows: _D. a. martirensis_: Baja California: San Matias Spring, 2. _D. a. simulans_: Baja California: Ensenada, 8. California: Dulzura, 1 (topotype); San Luis del Rey, 3.   ~Dipodomys agilis simulans~ (Merriam)  J. A. Allen (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:184, August 18, 1893) listed as _Perodipus agilis_ a specimen (6306/4941 AMNH) from Valladares, Baja California. Subspecies of this species were subsequently named without mentioning this specimen that, on geographic grounds, might be either _D. a. martirensis_ or _D. a. simulans_. Certain measurements of the specimen are as follows: Total length, 288; length of tail, 171; length of hind foot (dry), 41.0; greatest length of skull, 39.5; width of maxillary arch at middle, 4.5. The long tail and wide (4.5) maxillary arch are characteristic of _Dipodomys agilis simulans_ and constitute the basis for identifying the specimen as of that subspecies.   ~Baiomys taylori analogus~ Osgood  The geographic range currently assigned to _Baiomys taylori paulus_ (J. A. Allen) is separated in two parts by the geographic range assigned to _B. t. analogus_. The southern, separated part of the range of _B. t. paulus_ rests wholly on ten specimens from Colima, Colima, identified as _B. t. paulus_ by Osgood in his \"Revision of the mice of the American genus Peromyscus\" (N. Amer. Fauna, 28, April 17, 1909) where (p. 255) he places as a synonym of _Peromyscus taylori paulus_ J. A. Allen, 1903, _Peromyscus allex_ Osgood, 1904. The later name was based on these ten specimens (33422/45445-33427/45450, 33429/45452, 33432/45455, and 33435/45458 BS) from Colima. Osgood had a choice of synonymizing _P. allex_ under _P. paulus_ or _P. t. analogus_. According to Osgood's concept, _analogus_ was blackish and large; _allex_ was grayish and small; and _paulus_ was fawn colored and intermediate in size. The more nearly equal size of _paulus_ and _allex_ probably influenced Osgood in making his choice. After examining the original materials we think there is more to recommend the alternate choice. For example, two topotypes of equal age of the same sex of _allex_ (33424/45447) and _analogus_ (120264 BS) are of almost the same size and, respectively, measure as follows: Total length, 107, 108; length of tail, 42, 45; length of hind foot (measured dry), 13.1,"]]]
