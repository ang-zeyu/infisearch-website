In the rainy season the loud, rattling call of the males is heard at night throughout the Tepalcatepec Valley and the coastal lowlands.  Taylor and Smith (1945:552) revived Wiegmann's _Bufo horribilis_ for the large toads of México that are here referred to _B. marinus_. Their action was based upon the supposition that the \"species _marinus_\" is composite. Although probably true, this supposition has yet to be proved. Until the large, and apparently related, species of _Bufo_ inhabiting tropical America have been studied systematically as a unit, the recognition of segments of the population as either species or subspecies is meaningless. Taylor and Smith (op. cit.:553) based the description of a new species, _Bufo angustipes_, on one rather emaciated, formalin-hardened female from La Esperanza, Chiapas. The type (USNM 116513), when compared with numerous specimens of _Bufo marinus_ from throughout the range of the species in México and northern Central America, displays no combination of characters to set it off from the others. Therefore, I suggest that _Bufo horribilis_ Wiegmann and _Bufo angustipes_ Taylor and Smith be placed in the synonymy of _Bufo marinus_ (Linnaeus) until future systematic study of the genus and this species in particular establishes the existence of recognizable taxa.   ~Bufo marmoreus~ Wiegmann       _Bufo marmoreus_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 26:66,      1833.--Veracruz, Veracruz, México.

In Michoacán this species is confined to elevations of less than 1000 meters on the coast and foothills of the Sierra de Coalcomán. In this region in the months of June and July, breeding congregations have been found in temporary pools and along streams.  Smith and Taylor (1948:39), in their key to the Mexican species of _Bufo_, placed emphasis on the nature of the supraorbital and postorbital crests (whether they form a curve or a sharp angle) in distinguishing _Bufo marmoreus_ from _Bufo perplexus_. In the original description of _perplexus_, Taylor (1943a:347) characterized the species as follows: supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp angle, instead of a curve as in _marmoreus_; supratympanic crest smaller than in _marmoreus_; diagonal lateral stripe lacking in females; concentration of dorsal tubercles as found in _marmoreus_ lacking in males. The discovery of specimens in which the crests form a curve and others in which the crests form an angle in both the Tepalcatepec Valley and in the coastal lowlands prompted an investigation of these characters and others throughout the ranges of the species. An examination of 410 specimens has resulted in the following conclusions.   TABLE 1.--VARIATION IN THE SHAPE OF THE SUPRAORBITAL AND POSTORBITAL CRANIAL CRESTS IN BUFO MARMOREUS AND B.

Although the highest percentage of individuals having the     supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp angle is     from localities in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, numerous     individuals from throughout the range of _marmoreus_ have the     crests forming an angle (Table 1).       2. In all samples of ten or more specimens, some toads have      the supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp      angle, some have the crests forming a curve, and some have      an intermediate condition.       3. The relative size of the supratympanic crest is highly      variable in all samples examined.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.

A distinct, pale-colored, diagonal lateral stripe is      found in females only from localities outside of the      Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin; females from the basin have a      spotted dorsum.       5. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin usually have a      broad middorsal line that is yellow or pale tan; those from      outside the basin have either a narrow middorsal line or      none.       6. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin have low,      scattered dorsal tubercles (Fig. 3); males from outside the      basin have a concentration of tubercles in a broad band on      the back (Fig. 4).  Therefore the nature of the cranial crests is of little value in separating two populations, but the color pattern of the females and the nature of the dorsal tubercles of the males do show distinct differences. Furthermore, certain differences in size and proportion are evident; _Bufo marmoreus_ is a slightly larger toad and has a relatively longer tibia and longer head than _perplexus_ (Table 2).

Among the many paratypes are specimens from Tonolá, Chiapas, and Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. These apparently were referred to _perplexus_ solely on the nature of the cranial crests.

Ten specimens from Chilpancingo, Guerrero (UMMZ 115352), do not readily fit either species. Perhaps there is gene exchange between the inland and coastal populations through the relatively low pass at Chilpancingo, at the mouth of the Río Balsas, and near the convergent headwaters of the Río Coahuayana and Río Tepalcatepec in southern Jalisco. If this can be demonstrated, then _Bufo perplexus_ would have to be considered as a subspecies of _Bufo marmoreus_, instead of an allopatric species.   ~Bufo perplexus~ Taylor       _Bufo perplexus_ Taylor, Univ.

This toad is an inhabitant of pine and oak forests between 900 and 2400 meters. Near Charapendo on the slopes of the Sierra de los Tarascos and at Coalcomán it apparently reaches its lowest altitudinal limits. At both of these localities the pine-oak forest is replaced by arid tropical scrub forest on the lower slopes.  Twenty-four tadpoles were collected on May 3 in a quiet section of a fast stream near Barranca Seca. The tadpoles have a robust body, broadest about two-thirds the distance from the snout to the posterior edge of the body, half again as broad as deep. Eyes dorsolateral; nostrils dorsal, somewhat directed forward, and about three-fifths the distance from the tip of the snout to the eye; spiracle sinistral and lateral, located at about midbody; anus median; tail long and slender; tail-musculature extends nearly to tip of tail; depth of tail-musculature at mid-length about one-third total depth of tail; dorsal tail-fin not extending onto body (Fig. 5); average body length of ten tadpoles having small hind limb buds, 14.4 mm.; average tail length, 22.0 mm.  Mouth ventral, nearly terminal, about one-third as wide as widest part of body; anterior lip has no papillae; lower lip bordered by two rows of papillae and lateral lips by one row of papillae; beaks moderately well developed, the upper forming a broad arch and finely denticulate; tooth rows 2/3, the upper rows extending to the edge of the lips, subequal in length, and slightly longer than lower rows, which also are subequal in length; inner upper tooth row broken medially; inner lower tooth row sometimes broken (Fig. 6).  The body is black dorsally and laterally, and bluish gray ventrally; the tail musculature is brown and stippled with darker brown. The fins are transparent and stippled with brown, the stippling being most pronounced on the posterior two-thirds of the upper tail-fin.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.

Mouthparts of larval _Bufo occidentalis_ (UMMZ 94269) from Barranca Seca, Michoacán. × 20.]  Forty recently metamorphosed individuals average 18.9 mm. in snout-vent length.  The relationships of this toad seem to be with _Bufo bocourti_ Brocchi, an inhabitant of pine and oak forests in the uplands of Chiapas and Guatemala. In _Bufo occidentalis_ the tympanum usually is indistinct and sometimes completely covered, and it is absent in _bocourti_. _Bufo occidentalis_ has a broader interorbital area and relatively shorter and more rounded parotid glands than _bocourti_. The tadpoles of the two species are nearly identical (see Stuart, 1943:12).   ~Leptodactylus labialis~ (Cope)       _Cystignathus labialis_ Cope, Proc. Amer. Philos.

In the Tepalcatepec Valley this frog reaches the northernmost known limit of its range in western México. Although the species is abundant in the valley, it apparently is absent from the coastal lowlands. In the Tepalcatepec Valley _Leptodactylus melanonotus_ seems to be more abundant than _labialis_. In the rainy season both species have been heard calling from the same ponds and flooded fields.  There are only slight differences in size between the sexes; measurements of 20 males and eight females are, respectively: snout-vent length, 32.3-39.5 (35.1), 34.1-39.2 (37.2); tibia length, 14.3-17.0 (15.4), 14.9-16.8 (15.8); head width, 11.0-13.6 (12.0), 12.2-13.2 (12.6); head length, 12.8-15.1 (13.3), 12.8-14.6 (13.7).   ~Leptodactylus melanonotus~ (Hallowell)       _Cystignathus melanonotus_ Hallowell, Proc.

S of Lombardia; Río Marquez, 13 km. SE of      Nueva Italia (6); Río Tepalcatepec, 27 km. S of Apatzingán.   This species is widespread in the lowlands of the state; it has been collected up to elevations of 1050 meters in the Tepalcatepec Valley. In the dry season individuals were discovered beneath rocks along streams and in damp arroyos; in the rainy season they were found wherever there was water. Males were heard calling from flooded fields, ditches, rocky streams, and small puddles. The call is a series of individual notes: \"woink, woink, woink.\"  Adult males are noticeably smaller than females; measurements for 20 males and ten females from Apatzingán are, respectively: snout-vent length, 29.6-34.6 (32.3), 36.3-44.1 (40.8); tibia length, 12.6-15.1 (14.0), 16.5-19.0 (17.8); head width, 10.8-11.9 (11.3), 12.6-14.8 (13.7); head length, 11.2-13.2 (11.9), 13.1-14.8 (14.0). Brownish yellow ventral glands are present in some juveniles and in some adults collected in the dry season as well as in the rainy season.   ~Leptodactylus occidentalis~ Taylor       _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ Taylor, Trans. Kansas Acad.      Sci., 39:349, 1937.--Tepic, Nayarit, México.       Five km. W of Tangamandapio.  On the night of June 11, 1958, this species was calling from a hyacinth-choked ditch. Although numerous individuals were heard, only one specimen was obtained. The frogs were calling from the tangled mat of hyacinths along with _Hyla eximia_, _Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis_, and _Rana pipiens_.  Taylor (1936a:352) characterized this species as follows: \"The narrow head, small maximum size (38 mm. for females, 33 mm. for males), the character of the postaxillary and postfemoral glands, the narrower groups of vomerine teeth, clearly distinguish this western Mexican form from the more robust, larger _melanonotus_ to the south. The call is likewise fainter and different in quality.\" Concerning the glands, Taylor (_loc. cit._) remarked: \"There is a possibility that the horny excrescence covering the glands may appear only during the breeding season. This character is quite as strongly marked in females as in males.\" Bogert and Oliver (1945:324) concluded that the population of _Leptodactylus_ in northwestern México could not be distinguished from _melanonotus_ in other parts of the country and thus synonymized _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ with _melanonotus_. Bogert and Oliver (op. cit.: 324) stated that the extent as well as the presence or absence of ventral glands was highly variable in all samples examined by them.  Upon seeing numerous living individuals of _Leptodactylus melanonotus_ from many parts of its range in México and individuals of the population of _Leptodactylus_ in northwestern México (Nayarit and Sinaloa), I was immediately impressed not so much by the differences in the development of the ventral glands, but by the color of the glands. The differences in color are apparent in freshly preserved specimens. With the exception of _Leptodactylus_ from northwestern México, specimens of _melanonotus_ from throughout México and northern Central America have yellow or yellowish brown glands. Specimens from northwestern México have black or brownish black glands that are conspicuously darker than those found in _melanonotus_. Examination of 653 preserved specimens of _Leptodactylus melanonotus_ from México and Guatemala has failed to reveal specimens with black ventral glands, like those found in specimens from northwestern México, to which the name _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ has been applied. Furthermore, in _melanonotus_ the glands are less distinct and more extensive than in _occidentalis_; in the latter species glands are absent from the throat and midventral area, where they often are present in _melanonotus_ (Fig. 7).
