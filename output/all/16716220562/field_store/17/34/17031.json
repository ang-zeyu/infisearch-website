Wilson jerked the gun from Davis' weak grasp and hurled it away. Then he killed Davis.  He did it slowly, a surprising thing for Wilson. He lifted Davis by his neck and held him with his feet off the floor. He squeezed Davis' neck, seeming to do it with great leisure as Davis made horrible noises and kicked his legs.  Nora turned her eyes away, buried them in Frank Brooks' shoulder, but she could not keep the sounds from reaching her ears. Frank held her close. \"Take it easy,\" he said. \"Take it easy.\" And he was probably not conscious of saying it.  \"Tell him to hurry,\" Nora whispered. \"Tell him to get it over with. It's like killing--killing an animal.\"  \"That's what he is--an animal.\"  Frank Brooks stared in fascination at Leroy Davis' distorted, darkening face. It was beyond semblance of anything human now. The eyes bulged and the tongue came from his mouth as though frantically seeking relief.  The animal sounds quieted and died away. Nora heard the sound of the body falling to the floor--a limp, soft sound of finality. She turned and saw Jim Wilson with his hands still extended and cupped. The terrible hands from which the stench of a terrible life was drifting away into empty air.  Wilson looked down at his handiwork. \"He's dead,\" Wilson said slowly. He turned to face Frank and Nora. There was a great disappointment in his face. \"That's all there is to it,\" he said, dully. \"He's just--dead.\" Without knowing it for what it was, Jim Wilson was full of the futile aftertaste of revenge.  He bent down to pick up Minna's body. There was a small blue hole in the right cheek and another one over the left eye. With a glance at Frank and Nora, Jim Wilson covered the wounds with his hand as though they were not decent. He picked her up in his arms and walked across the lobby and up the stairs with the slow, quiet tread of a weary man.  The sound of the jeep welled up again, but it was further away now. Frank Brooks took Nora's hand and they hurried out into the street. As they crossed the sidewalk, the sound of the jeep was drowned by a sudden swelling of the wailings to the northward.  On still a new note, they rose and fell on the still air. A note of panic, of new knowledge, it seemed, but Frank and Nora were not paying close attention. The sounds of the jeep motor had come from the west and they got within sight of the Madison-Well intersection in time to see the jeep hurtle southward at its maximum speed.  Frank yelled and waved his arms, but he knew he had been neither seen nor heard. They were given little time for disappointment however, because a new center of interest appeared to the northward. From around the corner of Washington Street, into Clark, moved three strange figures.  There was a mixture of belligerence and distress in their actions. They carried odd looking weapons and seemed interested in using them upon something or someone, but they apparently lacked the energy to raise them although they appeared to be rather light.  The creatures themselves were humanoid, Frank thought. He tightened his grip on Nora's hand. \"They've seen us.\"  \"Let's not run,\" Nora said. \"I'm tired of running. All it's gotten us is trouble. Let's just stand here.\"  \"Don't be foolish.\"  \"I'm not running. You can if you want to.\"  Frank turned his attention back to the three strange creatures. He allowed natural curiosity full reign. Thoughts of flight vanished from his mind.  \"They're so thin--so fragile,\" Nora said.  \"But their weapons aren't.\"  \"It's hard to believe, even seeing them, that they're from another planet.\"  \"How so? They certainly don't look much like us.\"  \"I mean with the talk, for so long, about flying saucers and space flight and things like that. Here they are, but it doesn't seem possible.\"  \"There's something wrong with them.\"  This was true. Two of the strange beings had fallen to the sidewalk. The third came doggedly on, dragging one foot after the other until he went to his hands and knees. He remained motionless for a long time, his head hanging limply. Then he too, sank to the cement and lay still.  The wailings from the north now took on a tone of intense agony--great desperation. After that came a yawning silence.         *       *       *       *       *  \"They defeated themselves,\" the military man said. \"Or rather, natural forces defeated them. We certainly had little to do with it.\"  Nora, Frank, and Jim Wilson stood at the curb beside a motorcycle. The man on the cycle supported it with a leg propped against the curb as he talked.  \"We saw three of them die up the street,\" Frank said.  \"Our scouting party saw the same thing happen. That's why we moved in. It's about over now. We'll know a lot more about them and where they came from in twenty-four hours.\"  They had nothing further to say. The military man regarded them thoughtfully. \"I don't know about you three. If you ignored the evacuation through no fault of your own and can prove it--\"  \"There were four of us,\" Jim Wilson said. \"Then we met another man. He's inside on the floor. I killed him.\"  \"Murder?\" the military man said sharply.  \"He killed a woman who was with us,\" Frank said. \"He was a maniac. When he's identified I'm pretty sure he'll have a past record.\"  \"Where is the woman's body?\"  \"On a bed upstairs,\" Wilson said.  \"I'll have to hold all of you. Martial law exists in this area. You're in the hands of the army.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The streets were full of people now, going about their business, pushing and jostling, eating in the restaurants, making electricity for the lights, generating power for the telephones.  Nora, Frank, and Jim Wilson sat in a restaurant on Clark Street. \"We're all different people now,\" Nora said. \"No one could go through what we've been through and be the same.\"  Jim Wilson took her statement listlessly. \"Did they find out what it was about our atmosphere that killed them?\"  \"They're still working on that, I think.\" Frank Brooks stirred his coffee, raised a spoonful and let it drip back into the cup.  \"I'm going up to the Chicago Avenue police station,\" Wilson said.  Frank and Nora looked up in surprise. Frank asked, \"Why? The military court missed it--the fact you escaped from jail.\"  \"They didn't miss it I don't think. I don't think they cared much. I'm going back anyway.\"  \"It won't be much of a rap.\"  \"No, a pretty small one. I want to get it over with.\"  He got up from his chair. \"So long. Maybe I'll see you around.\"  \"So long.\"  \"Goodbye.\"  Frank said, \"I think I'll beat it too. I've got a job in a factory up north. Maybe they're operating again.\" He got to his feet and stood awkwardly by the table. \"Besides--I've got some pay coming.\"  Nora didn't say anything.  Frank said, \"Well--so long. Maybe I'll see you around.\"  \"Maybe. Goodbye.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Brooks walked north on Clark Street. He was glad to get away from the restaurant. Nora was a good kid but hell--you didn't take up with a hooker. A guy played around, but you didn't stick with them.  But it made a guy think. He was past the kid stage. It was time for him to find a girl and settle down. A guy didn't want to knock around all his life.         *       *       *       *       *  Nora walked west on Madison Street. Then she remembered the Halstead Street slums were in that direction and turned south on Wells. She had nine dollars in her bag and that worried her. You couldn't get along on nine dollars in Chicago very long.  There was a tavern on Jackson near Wells. Nora went inside. The barkeep didn't frown at her. That was good. She went to the bar and ordered a beer and was served.  After a while a man came in. A middle aged man who might have just come into Chicago--whose bags might still be at the LaSalle Street Station down the block. The man looked at Nora, then away. After a while looked at her again.  Nora smiled."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],["title","Triplanetary (#0)"],["body","MAN DISCOVERED THE TRUTH_     --The Fall of Rome, the Wars that racked the world, mass murder and    horror....

A couple of hundreds of millions of years either way do not matter, since at least that much time was required for the inter-passage. At about that same time--within the same plus-or-minus ten percent margin of error, it is believed--practically all of the suns of both those galaxies became possessed of planets.  There is much evidence to support the belief that it was not merely a coincidence that so many planets came into being at about the same time as the galactic inter-passage. Another school of thought holds that it was pure coincidence; that all suns have planets as naturally and as inevitably as cats have kittens.  Be that as it may, Arisian records are clear upon the point that before the two galaxies began to coalesce, there were never more than three solar systems present in either; and usually only one. Thus, when the sun of the planet upon which their race originated grew old and cool, the Arisians were hard put to it to preserve their culture, since they had to work against time in solving the engineering problems associated with moving a planet from an older to a younger sun.  Since nothing material was destroyed when the Eddorians were forced into the next plane of existence, their historical records also have become available. Those records--folios and tapes and playable discs of platinum alloy, resistant indefinitely even to Eddore's noxious atmosphere--agree with those of the Arisians upon this point. Immediately before the Coalescence began there was one, and only one, planetary solar system in the Second Galaxy; and, until the advent of Eddore, the Second Galaxy was entirely devoid of intelligent life.  Thus for millions upon untold millions of years the two races, each the sole intelligent life of a galaxy, perhaps of an entire space-time continuum, remained completely in ignorance of each other. Both were already ancient at the time of the Coalescence. The only other respect in which the two were similar, however, was in the possession of minds of power.  Since Arisia was Earth-like in composition, atmosphere, and climate, the Arisians were at that time distinctly humanoid. The Eddorians were not. Eddore was and is large and dense; its liquid a poisonous, sludgy syrup; its atmosphere a foul and corrosive fog. Eddore was and is unique; so different from any other world of either galaxy that its very existence was inexplicable until its own records revealed the fact that it did not originate in normal space-time at all, but came to our universe from some alien and horribly different other.  As differed the planets, so differed the peoples. The Arisians went through the usual stages of savagery and barbarism on the way to Civilization. The Age of Stone. The Ages of Bronze, of Iron, of Steel, and of Electricity. Indeed, it is probable that it is because the Arisians went through these various stages that all subsequent Civilizations have done so, since the spores which burgeoned into life upon the cooling surfaces of all the planets of the commingling galaxies were Arisian, not Eddorian, in origin. Eddorian spores, while undoubtedly present, must have been so alien that they could not develop in any one of the environments, widely variant although they are, existing naturally or coming naturally into being in normal space and time.  The Arisians--especially after atomic energy freed them from physical labor--devoted themselves more and ever more intensively to the exploration of the limitless possibilities of the mind.  Even before the Coalescence, then, the Arisians had need neither of space-ships nor of telescopes. By power of mind alone they watched the lenticular aggregation of stars which was much later to be known to Tellurian astronomers as Lundmark's Nebula approach their own galaxy. They observed attentively and minutely and with high elation the occurrence of mathematical impossibility; for the chance of two galaxies ever meeting in direct, central, equatorial-plane impact and of passing completely through each other is an infinitesimal of such a high order as to be, even mathematically, practically indistinguishable from zero.  They observed the birth of numberless planets, recording minutely in their perfect memories every detail of everything that happened; in the hope that, as ages passed, either they or their descendants would be able to develop a symbology and a methodology capable of explaining the then inexplicable phenomenon. Carefree, busy, absorbedly intent, the Arisian mentalities roamed throughout space--until one of them struck an Eddorian mind.         *       *       *       *       *  While any Eddorian could, if it chose, assume the form of a man, they were in no sense man-like. Nor, since the term implies a softness and a lack of organization, can they be described as being amoeboid. They were both versatile and variant. Each Eddorian changed, not only its shape, but also its texture, in accordance with the requirements of the moment. Each produced--extruded--members whenever and wherever it needed them; members uniquely appropriate to the task then in work. If hardness was indicated, the members were hard; if softness, they were soft. Small or large, rigid or flexible; joined or tentacular--all one. Filaments or cables; fingers or feet; needles or mauls--equally simple. One thought and the body fitted the job.  They were asexual: sexless to a degree unapproached by any form of Tellurian life higher than the yeasts. They were not merely hermaphroditic, nor androgynous, nor parthenogenetic. They were completely without sex. They were also, to all intents and purposes and except for death by violence, immortal. For each Eddorian, as its mind approached the stagnation of saturation after a lifetime of millions of years, simply divided into two new-old beings. New in capacity and in zest; old in ability and in power, since each of the two \"children\" possessed in toto the knowledges and the memories of their one \"parent.\"  And if it is difficult to describe in words the physical aspects of the Eddorians, it is virtually impossible to write or to draw, in any symbology of Civilization, a true picture of an Eddorian's--_any_ Eddorian's--mind. They were intolerant, domineering, rapacious, insatiable, cold, callous, and brutal. They were keen, capable, persevering, analytical, and efficient. They had no trace of any of the softer emotions or sensibilities possessed "]]]
