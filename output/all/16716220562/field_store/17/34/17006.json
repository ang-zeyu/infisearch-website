I didn't dare use the telephone to chat with Tom in the ship, for fear I might miss an important word or phrase from our scout. So I sat and sat and strained my ears. After a while, I heard \"_Mishgashu!_\" which told me that Monroe was in the neighborhood of the other dome and was creeping toward it under cover of whatever boulders were around.  [Illustration]  And then, abruptly, I heard Monroe yell my name and there was a terrific clattering in my headphones. Radio interference! He'd been caught, and whoever had caught him had simultaneously jammed his suit transmitter with a larger transmitter from the alien dome.  Then there was silence.  After a while, I told Tom what had happened. He just said, \"Poor Monroe.\" I had a good idea of what his expression was like.  \"Look, Tom,\" I said, \"if you take off now, you still won't have anything important to tell. After capturing Monroe, whatever's in that other dome will come looking for us, I think. I'll let them get close enough for us to learn something of their appearance--at least if they're human or non-human. Any bit of information about them is important. I'll shout it up to you and you'll still be able to take off in plenty of time. All right?\"  \"You're the boss, Colonel,\" he said in a mournful voice. \"Lots of luck.\"  And then there was nothing to do but wait. There was no oxygen system in the dome yet, so I had to squeeze up a sandwich from the food compartment in my suit. I sat there, thinking about the expedition. Nine years, and all that careful secrecy, all that expenditure of money and mind-cracking research--and it had come to this. Waiting to be wiped out, in a blast from some unimaginable weapon. I understood Monroe's last request. We often felt we were so secret that our immediate superiors didn't even want us to know what we we were working on. Scientists are people--they wish for recognition, too. I was hoping the whole expedition would be written up in the history books, but it looked unpromising.         *       *       *       *       *  Two hours later, the scout ship landed near the dome. The lock opened and, from where I stood in the open door of our dome, I saw Monroe come out and walk toward me.  I alerted Tom and told him to listen carefully. \"It may be a trick--he might be drugged....\"  He didn't act drugged, though--not exactly. He pushed his way past me and sat down on a box to one side of the dome. He put his booted feet up on another, smaller box.  \"How are you, Ben?\" he asked. \"How's every little thing?\"  I grunted. \"_Well?_\" I know my voice skittered a bit.  He pretended puzzlement. \"Well _what_? Oh, I see what you mean. The other dome--you want to know who's in it. You have a right to be curious, Ben. Certainly. The leader of a top-secret expedition like this--Project Hush they call us, huh, Ben--finds another dome on the Moon. He thinks he's been the first to land on it, so naturally he wants to--\"  \"Major Monroe Gridley!\" I rapped out. \"You will come to attention and deliver your report. Now!\" Honestly, I felt my neck swelling up inside my helmet.  Monroe just leaned back against the side of the dome. \"That's the _Army_ way of doing things,\" he commented admiringly. \"Like the recruits say, there's a right way, a wrong way and an Army way. Only there are other ways, too.\" He chuckled. \"Lots of other ways.\"  \"He's off,\" I heard Tom whisper over the telephone. \"Ben, Monroe has gone and blown his stack.\"  \"They aren't extraterrestrials in the other dome, Ben,\" Monroe volunteered in a sudden burst of sanity. \"No, they're human, all right, and from Earth. Guess _where_.\"  \"I'll kill you,\" I warned him. \"I swear I'll kill you, Monroe. Where are they from--Russia, China, Argentina?\"  He grimaced. \"What's so secret about those places? Go on!--guess again.\"  I stared at him long and hard. \"The only place else--\"  \"Sure,\" he said. \"You got it, Colonel. The other dome is owned and operated by the Navy. The goddam United States Navy!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32657"],["title","Spillthrough (#0)"],["body","By Daniel F.

But it would take Brad suicidal minutes!]   Like the sibilant, labored breathing of a dying monster, the tortured ship wailed its death sobs as it floundered in deep hyperstellar space.  _Clank-sss, clank-sss_, went the battered safety valve of the pile cooling system.  _BOOM ... boom ... BOOM ... boom._ A severed and dangling piston rod crashed in monotonous rhythm against a deck beam as the rest of the auxiliary compression unit strained to satisfy its function.  An off-beat bass viol strum added its depressive note to the symphony of destruction's aftermath--_throom-throom ... throom-throom_. It was the persistent expansion of plate metal reacting to heat from a ruptured tube jacket.  Forward, in the control compartment of the cargo craft, the sounds were muted. But the intervening bulkheads did not lessen their portent.  Brad Conally ran a hand over the stubbles on his cheek and swayed forward in the bucket-type seat, his head falling to rest against the control column.  Somewhere aft the ship groaned and metal scraped against metal with a sickening rending sound.  There was a lurch and Brad was jerked to one side, his head ramming against the inclination control. The ventral jet came to life in unexpected protest and fired once.  His hand shot out instinctively to return the loose, displaced lever to neutral. But the force of the single burst had already taken effect and the lower part of his stomach tied itself in a knot.  Centrifugal force reeled him to the fringe of consciousness. He struggled to reach the dorsal-ventral firing lever, praying that the linkage was not severed and the mechanism was still operative. His hand found the lever and jerked. The dorsal jet came to life with a roar. He jockeyed the control back and forth across neutral position. The two jets fired alternately. The sickening, end-over-end gyration became gentler.  The ship steadied itself again into immobility. But a snap sounded from back aft. It was followed by a grating noise that crescendoed and culminated in a terrific crash. His ears popped. A _clang_ reverberated, evidence of an automatic airlock sealing off another punctured section of the vessel.  Shrugging fatigue from his body, he looked up at the panel. The massometer showed a decrease of six tons. The explanation was simple, Brad laughed dryly: A good one-quarter of his load of crated inter-calc audio retention banks had rammed through the hull and floated into space.  He glanced at the scope. The twenty odd crates, some of them taking up an orbital relationship with the vessel, were blips on the screen.  Twisting the massometer section selector, he read off the figures. Hold One showed full cargo of inter-calc equipment. Hold Two, with its thirty bins of hematite, was intact. The third cargo compartment, containing more crated inter-calc units, was the damaged one. The massometer reading for that hold accounted for the missing weight.         *       *       *       *       *  \"How're you doing, Brad?\" the receiver rasped feebly. He recoiled at the unexpected sound.  \"She's still in one piece, Jim,\" he shouted to compensate for the strength the signal would lose in traveling the distance to the fleeing lifecraft. \"Have you cleared through your second hyperjump yet?\"  \"Getting ready to go into the third. There won't be any more communicating after that ... not with this short-range gear and your faulty transmitter. Find out the trouble yet?\"  Brad ignored the question. \"How long, Jim?\" His voice was eager. \"How long before you get to port?\"  \"Three jumps in one day. Seven more to go. That figures out to a little over two more days. I'm making better time than we expected with this peanut. Allow two more days for the slow tows to return.... Still think it'll hold together?\"  Brad was silent.  \"Brad,\" Jim's voice went into low gear. \"I've still got enough juice to come back and pick you up. After all, one ship and one load of cargo ... it's just not worth it.\"  Brad listened to the ominous convulsions of the ship for a moment. \"Your orders are to continue to Vega IV. I'm sticking.\"  \"But, skipper! Dammit! There's always the chance of spilling through into normal! That's a torturous way to go!\"  Brad's lips brushed roughly against the bulkhead mike. \"If I fall through it's just me, isn't it?\"  Although the sound level was too low, he knew there was a sigh on the other end. \"Okay,\" the speaker whispered. \"If I can't convince you....\"  Brad leaned against the bulkhead and shivered. He'd have to see whether he couldn't get more output from the heat converter--if he could chance going past the leaking pile again. Or _was_ it the cold that was causing him to tremble?--If he entered normal space at less than minimum breakthrough speed.... He didn't complete the distasteful mental picture.  He thought of his only functioning hyperdrive tube. Its gauge showed a power level that was only high enough to boost the craft back onto the hyperspace level when it started to conform with the normal tendency to fall through. How many times the tube could be counted on to repeat the performance he couldn't guess. It might be painful if he should let the drop gain too much momentum before correcting--human beings were built to cross the barrier in nothing longer than a micro-second. But, he resolved, he would worry about that when the time came.  \"Why don't you let it go, Brad?\" the voice leaped through the grating again.  Brad started. He thought Jim had cut the communication.  \"You know the score. If we swing this we can get all of West Cluster Supplies' work. We'll need an extra ship--several of them. But with the contract we'll be able to borrow as much as we want.\"  Jim laughed. \"At least I'm glad there's a rational, mercenary motive. For a while I thought you were going through with that go-down-with-the-ship routine.\"  Boom ... _Boom_ ... BOOM. The loose rod pounded with suddenly increasing fury.  He lunged through the hatch. At least the compression unit was forward of the faulty pile. And, while he did the job which automatic regulators had abandoned, he would not have to keep track of his time of exposure to hard radiation.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Calling Space Ship Fleury. Repeat: Calling Space Ship Fleury.... Answer please.\"  Brad jerked his head off the panel ledge. Hot coffee from a container that his limp hand half-gripped sloshed over the brim and spilled on the deck. He turned a haggard, puzzled face to the bulkhead speaker.  It had flooded the compartment with sound--live, vibrant sound. The signal had been loud and clear. Not weak. Not like the one from Jim's lifecraft two jumps away.  \"This is the SS Fleury!\" he shouted, stumbling forward eagerly and gripping the gooseneck of the mike. \"Come in!\"  \"Fleury from SS Cluster Queen.... Answering your SOS.\"  His hopes suddenly vanished. \"Is that Altman? What are you doing on this run?\"  \"Yeah, Conally. This is Altman. Freeholding to Vega.... What's your trouble? Anything serious?\"  Altman had come in to unload at Arcturus II Spaceport while the Fleury was still docked, Brad recalled. The huge ship had been berthed next to his.  \"Main drive jacket blown out in the engine compartment,\" Brad said hoarsely. \"It happened at the end of the eighth jump. We're about a half-notch into hyper--just barely off the border.\"  \"That's tough.\" There was little consolation in the tone. \"Got any passengers?\"  \"No. None this trip. I'm solo now. My engineer's gone off in the craft.\"  \"Can't you replace that jacket and limp through?\"  \"Got a faulty gasket on the replacement. Can't be patched up.\"  \"You're in a helluva fix, Conally. Even a Lunar ferry pilot's got enough sense to check his spare parts before blastoff.\"  \"I check mine after each landing. There isn't much that can happen to it when the pile's cold.... Can you give me a tow, Altman?\"  \"Can't do that, Conally. I'm not....\"  \"If you'll just give me a boost then. To the crest of this hyperjump. Then I won't have to worry about slipping through.\"  \"Like I started to tell you,\" Altman intoned insistently, \"one of my grapples is sheared.\"  \"You still have two more.\"  \"Uh-uh. This wise boy ain't gonna take a chance of a line snapping and knocking a hunk outta my hull. Especially when you got cargo spilling all over space.\"  Brad clenched his fists. He spoke through his teeth. \"Look, Altman. Regulations say....\"  \"... I gotta help you,\" the other cut him short. \"I know that, pal. That's why I happen to be stopping off at this not too enticing spot. And I'm offering help.... Come aboard any time you want.\"  \"And hang up a free salvage sign on the Fleury?\"  Altman didn't answer.  Twisting the gooseneck in his hand, Brad sucked in a deep breath and blew it out in a rush. But he didn't say what had leaped into his mind. Instead he glanced over at the panel's screen.  Altman's ship showed up there--a large, greenish-yellow blip. There were other small dots on the scope too. As he looked, the large blip coasted over to one of the dots. The two became one mark on the screen.  \"You're picking up my cargo!\" Brad shouted.  \"The stuff not in orbit around the Fleury ain't yours any longer, Conally,\" Altman laughed. \"You oughta bone up on your salvage laws.\"  \"You damned scavenger!\"  \"Now, now, Brad,\" the other said smoothly. \"What would you do if you were in my position? Would you let top priority cargo slip through to normal and get lost off the hyperlane? Or would you scoop it up and bring it in for bonus price?\"  \"You're not after a bonus,\" Brad roared into the mike. \"You're after a contract...."]]]
