A common smith, who,       though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails,       if, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will       scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in       a day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to       make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a       nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence, make more than eight       hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys, under       twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of       making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of       them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of       a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same       person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion,       heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head,       too, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into       which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of       them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it       has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The       rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are       performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen       them, be supposed capable of acquiring.            Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost       in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we       should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very       quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a       different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who       cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from       his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades       can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt,       much less. It is, even in this case, however, very considerable. A man       commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment       to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and       hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he       rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and       of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather       necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change       his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty       different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always       slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the       most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in       point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the       quantity of work which he is capable of performing.            Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is       facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is       unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the       invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and       abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.       Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of       attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed       towards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great       variety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labour, the       whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some       one very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that       some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of       labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their       own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement.       A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which       labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common       workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,       naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier       methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such       manufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which       were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken       their own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines {this was       the current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed       to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the       cylinder, according as the piston either ascended or descended. One of       those boys, who loved to play with his companions, observed that, by tying       a string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to       another part of the machine, the valve would open and shut without his       assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his       play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon       this machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the       discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour.            All the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the       inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many       improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the       machines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and       some by that of those who are called philosophers, or men of speculation,       whose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every thing, and       who, upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers       of the most distant and dissimilar objects in the progress of society,       philosophy or speculation becomes, like every other employment, the       principal or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens.       Like every other employment, too, it is subdivided into a great number of       different branches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe       or class of philosophers; and this subdivision of employment in       philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves dexterity, and       saves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own peculiar       branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science is       considerably increased by it.            It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different       arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a       well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the       lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own       work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every       other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to       exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or, what       comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He       supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they       accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general       plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the society.            Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a       civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of       people, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been       employed in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The       woollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and       rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great       multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the       wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver,       the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different       arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants       and carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the       materials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very       distant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in       particular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers,       must have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs       made use of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the       world? What a variety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the       tools of the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated       machines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the       loom of the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labour is       requisite in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which       the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for       smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to       be made use of in the smelting-house, the brickmaker, the bricklayer, the       workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the forger, the smith,       must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were       we to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress       and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears next his       skin, the shoes which "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300"],["title","An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (#3)"],["body","his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all       the different parts which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he       prepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose,       dug from the bowels of the earth, and brought to him, perhaps, by a long       sea and a long land-carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all       the furniture of his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter       plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals, the different       hands employed in preparing his bread and his beer, the glass window which       lets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the wind and the rain, with       all the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy       invention, without which these northern parts of the world could scarce       have afforded a very comfortable habitation, together with the tools of       all the different workmen employed in producing those different       conveniencies; if we examine, I say, all these things, and consider what a       variety of labour is employed about each of them, we shall be sensible       that, without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the very       meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even       according to, what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in       which he is commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more       extravagant luxury of the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear       extremely simple and easy; and yet it may be true, perhaps, that the       accommodation of an European prince does not always so much exceed that of       an industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the latter       exceeds that of many an African king, the absolute masters of the lives       and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.        CHAPTER II. OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION TO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.              This division of labour, from which so many advantages are derived, is not       originally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that       general opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though       very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human       nature, which has in view no such extensive utility; the propensity to       truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.            Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human       nature, of which no further account can be given, or whether, as seems       more probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason       and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire. It is common       to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals, which seem to       know neither this nor any other species of contracts. Two greyhounds, in       running down the same hare, have sometimes the appearance of acting in       some sort of concert. Each turns her towards his companion, or endeavours       to intercept her when his companion turns her towards himself. This,       however, is not the effect of any contract, but of the accidental       concurrence of their passions in the same object at that particular time.       Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for       another with another dog. Nobody ever saw one animal, by its gestures and       natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am willing       to give this for that. When an animal wants to obtain something either of       a man, or of another animal, it has no other means of persuasion, but to       gain the favour of those whose service it requires. A puppy fawns upon its       dam, and a spaniel endeavours, by a thousand attractions, to engage the       attention of its master who is at dinner, when it wants to be fed by him.       Man sometimes uses the same arts with his brethren, and when he has no       other means of engaging them to act according to his inclinations,       endeavours by every servile and fawning attention to obtain their good       will. He has not time, however, to do this upon every occasion. In       civilized society he stands at all times in need of the co-operation and       assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is scarce sufficient       to gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every other race of       animals, each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is entirely       independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance of       no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the       help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their       benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest       their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their own       advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to       another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I       want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such       offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far       greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not       from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we       expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address       ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk       to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a       beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his       fellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon it entirely. The       charity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him with the whole fund       of his subsistence. But though this principle ultimately provides him with       all the necessaries of life which he has occasion for, it neither does nor       can provide him with them as he has occasion for them. The greater part of       his occasional wants are supplied in the same manner as those of other       people, by treaty, by barter, and by purchase. With the money which one       man gives him he purchases food. The old clothes which another bestows       upon him he exchanges for other clothes which suit him better, or for       lodging, or for food, or for money, with which he can buy either food,       clothes, or lodging, as he has occasion.            As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one       another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in       need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives       occasion to the division of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds, a       particular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness       and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or       for venison, with his companions; and he finds at last that he can, in       this manner, get more cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the       field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the       making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a       sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their       little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way       to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with       venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself       entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In       the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a tanner       or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of       savages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus       part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own       consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he may       have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular       occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent of       genius he may possess for that particular species of business.            The difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much       less than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to       distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is       not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division       of labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between       a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not       so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came       in to the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence,       they were, perhaps, very much alike, and neither their parents nor       play-fellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or       soon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The       difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by       degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to       acknowledge scarce any resemblance. But without the disposition to truck,       barter, and exchange, every man must have procured to himself every       necessary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All must have had the       same duties to perform, and the same work to do, and there could have been       no such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great       difference of talents.            As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so       remarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same       disposition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals,   "]]]
