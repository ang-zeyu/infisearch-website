The latter seemed to regard the owl as the greater enemy, but ordinarily any large raptor arouses their hostility.  Because of their exceptionally swift and skillful flight, the adult kites have few natural enemies, but the eggs or nestlings are vulnerable to such enemies as crows, jays, the larger hawks and owls, and to certain mammalian predators, notably raccoons. Also, many nests probably are destroyed by the sudden and violent summer storms that are characteristic of the High Plains. Bendire (1892:178) cited observations by Goss that in a hailstorm in Barber County, Kansas, eggs were destroyed in many kites' nests and some of the nests were almost completely demolished. Several nests found by me to have incubating eggs in the first week of June were abandoned or had disappeared completely by July 18, but the cause was not evident. One nest that was under observation on July 22 had nestlings approximately two-thirds grown on that date, but on August 4 only a few sticks remained, and the carcass of a fledgling dangled from a limb ten feet below the nest. Even at the Park where firearms are prohibited, kites are sometimes shot by ignorant or malicious persons. In general, Kansas ranchers recognize the harmless and beneficial habits of kites, appreciate their esthetic appeal and protect them, but many persons use them as convenient targets, with utter disregard for the Federal laws protecting them. Because of the strong popular prejudice against raptorial birds in general, laws protecting them are usually not enforced. Law enforcement officers do not take action even when clear-cut violations come to their attention. Arrest and prosecution for the killing of any kind of raptor is almost out of the question in Kansas.                        Ratio of Immatures to Adults  In the juvenal plumage flight feathers of the kites are brown, barred with white, much different in appearance from the dark, slaty plumage of adults. Bent (_op. cit._:67) stated that these barred flight feathers are retained through the second summer, and he quoted Mr. G. W. Stevens as having found kites breeding in this immature plumage. On June 2, 1961, I attempted to determine the ratio of these yearling kites to others in the population at the Park. Most of the kites seen were in flight too far away to discern definitely whether or not they were juveniles, and records were limited to those seen at relatively close range. In a total of 108 records only 11 pertained to these yearlings and the remaining 97 were identified as of adults. Beyond doubt in the course of my counts some individuals were recorded repeatedly, therefore the counts are not entirely acceptable. However, on each occasion that kites were seen in numbers in early summer, the adults greatly outnumbered the juveniles. The approximate nine to one ratio of adults to yearlings seems much too high. Even if the difference is much less than indicated, the high ratio of adults to yearlings would seem to imply that the adults have a long life expectancy. A rather improbable alternative is that some of the yearlings remain in winter quarters or wander elsewhere rather than accompanying the adults on the return migration to their breeding grounds. Still another alternative is that the breeding season of 1960 was relatively unsuccessful, but this idea is negated by my own observations at the Park in late 1960, as recently fledged young were numerous then.  At the time of my visit to the Park August 21 to 24, 1961, all young had recently left the nests and were able to fly. However, their behavior was so much different from that of the adults that a reliable ratio could not be obtained. The fledglings tended to remain in the nest tree, or to make relatively short flights near it, while the adults occupied with catching of prey for themselves and their young, spent much of their time aloft. The adults were hence far more conspicuous than the fledglings. However, it is my impression that the fledglings were from one-third to one-fourth as numerous as the adults. If this ratio is correct, and if all adults had bred, from two-thirds to three-fourths of the eggs and/or nestlings must have been destroyed. This rate of loss seems reasonable in view of the known histories of nests observed in June and again in July, and of the fates of birds' nests in general.                                   Summary  Mississippi kites were studied in southwestern Kansas in the summer of 1961, at various localities, especially at Meade State Park. At this locality, near the northwestern limit of the breeding range, the kite thrives in typical High Plains habitat dominated by a short-grass type of vegetation, but availability of trees suitable for nests is a limiting factor. Since maturing of extensive groves of cottonwoods and other trees planted at Meade State Park, the colony of kites has increased tremendously and the breeding population probably exceeded 100 in 1961.  The kites are social in all their activities and do not maintain territories. The sexes differ little in appearance, but males are slightly smaller than females and have paler heads. Food consists almost entirely of flying insects, and these are usually eaten while the kite is in flight. Kites that are feeding nestlings may travel up to two miles from the nest or perhaps considerably farther in the course of their foraging. For 148 feedings of nestlings the observed intervals averaged 10.7 minutes. Most published references to the food habits mention predation on small vertebrates, especially lizards, but including also snakes, toads, rodents, and even rabbits. In my study a total of 205 pellets were collected and 453 insects were tentatively identified but the total number of insects in the pellets was much larger. No vertebrates were identified from this sample and among 358 prey items identified from kite stomachs collected in Oklahoma, by Sutton, vertebrae of a small fish were the only vertebrate remains. Further verification of predation on mammals, reptiles and amphibians by this species is needed. Of the insects distinguished in pellets, beetles including carabids, cicindelids, hydrophilids, scarabaeids, and silphids were most numerous (270) and grasshoppers (164) were second; also there were 16 cicadas and three moths.  Kites arrive in Kansas about the second week in May. Often old nests are repaired and used over again. Hatching is about mid-June. Normally there are two eggs per clutch. By mid-August the fledglings are learning to fly. By the latter part of August they are learning to capture their insect prey, and in early September southward movement of the entire population begins.  Eggs and/or young in many nests are destroyed by hail or high wind in the sudden violent storms that are characteristic of the High Plains. Mississippi kites are often shot by misguided persons, and benefit little from the protection supposedly provided by Federal law. However, the adults probably have few natural enemies. The high ratio of older adults to yearlings indicates that the life expectancy is long. Through their second summer the kites retain their barred immature plumage, and can be readily distinguished from adults. Only ten per cent of the kites recorded in 108 June sight records at the Park were in juvenile plumage.                                Literature Cited      AUDUBON, J. J.         1840.

EDITOR'S APOLOGY _and_ DEDICATION   _In order that there may be no misunderstanding as to the why and the wherefore of this collection of tales it appears to me to be desirable that I should at the outset state my reasons for acting as the medium between the spirit of the late Baron Munchausen and the reading public. In common with a large number of other great men in history Baron Munchausen has suffered because he is not understood. I have observed with wondering surprise the steady and constant growth of the idea that Baron Munchausen was not a man of truth; that his statements of fact were untrustworthy, and that as a realist he had no standing whatsoever. Just how this misconception of the man's character has arisen it would be difficult to say. Surely in his published writings he shows that same lofty resolve to be true to life as he has seen it that characterises the work of some of the high Apostles of Realism, who are writing of the things that will teach future generations how we of to-day ordered our goings-on. The note of veracity in Baron Munchausen's early literary venturings rings as clear and as true certainly as the similar note in the charming studies of Manx Realism that have come to us of late years from the pen of Mr. Corridor Walkingstick, of Gloomster Abbey and London. We all remember the glow of satisfaction with which we read Mr. Walkingstick's great story of the love of the clergyman, John Stress, for the charming little heroine, Glory Partridge. Here was something at last that rang true. The picture was painted in the boldest of colours, and, regardless of consequences to himself, Mr. Walkingstick dared to be real when he might have given rein to his imagination. Mr. Walkingstick was, thereupon, lifted up by popular favour to the level of an apostle--nay, he even admitted the soft impeachment--and now as a moral teacher he is without a rival in the world of literature. Yet the same age that accepts this man as a moral teacher, rejects Baron Munchausen, who, in different manner perhaps, presented to the world as true and life-like a picture of the conditions of his day as that given to us by Mr. Walkingstick in his deservedly popular romance, \"Episcopalians I have Met.\" Of course, I do not claim that Baron Munchausen's stories in bulk or in specified instances, have the literary vigour that is so marked a quality of the latter-day writer, but the point I do wish to urge is that to accept the one as a veracious chronicler of his time and to reject the other as one who indulges his pen in all sorts of grotesque vagaries, without proper regard for the facts, is a great injustice to the man of other times. The question arises, _why_ is this? How has this wrong upon the worthy realist of the eighteenth century been perpetrated? Is it an intentional or an unwitting wrong? I prefer to believe that it is based upon ignorance of the Baron's true quality, due to the fact that his works are rarely to be found within the reach of the public: in some cases, because of the failure of librarians to comprehend his real motives, his narratives are excluded from Public and Sunday-School libraries; and because of their extreme age, they are not easily again brought into vogue. I have, therefore, accepted the office of intermediary between the Baron and the readers of the present day, in order that his later work, which, while it shows to a marked degree the decadence of his literary powers, may yet serve to demonstrate to the readers of my own time how favourably he compares with some of the literary idols of to-day, in the simple matter of fidelity to fact. If these stories which follow shall serve to rehabilitate Baron Munchausen as a lover and practitioner of the arts of Truth, I shall not have made the sacrifice of my time in vain. If they fail of this purpose I shall still have the satisfaction of knowing that I have tried to render a service to an honest and defenceless man._  _Meanwhile I dedicate this volume, with sentiments of the highest regard, to that other great realist_                        MR.

MUNCHAUSEN  AN ACCOUNT OF HIS RECENT ADVENTURES     I  I ENCOUNTER THE OLD GENTLEMAN   There are moments of supreme embarrassment in the lives of persons given to veracity,--indeed it has been my own unusual experience in life that the truth well stuck to is twice as hard a proposition as a lie so obvious that no one is deceived by it at the outset. I cannot quite agree with my friend, Caddy Barlow, who says that in a tight place it is better to lie at once and be done with it than to tell the truth which will need forty more truths to explain it, but I must confess that in my forty years of absolute and conscientious devotion to truth I have found myself in holes far deeper than any my most mendacious of friends ever got into. I do not propose, however, to desert at this late hour the Goddess I have always worshipped because she leads me over a rough and rocky road, and whatever may be the hardships involved in my wooing I intend to the very end to remain the ever faithful slave of Mademoiselle Veracité. All of which I state here in prefatory mood, and in order, in so far as it is possible for me to do so, to disarm the incredulous and sniffy reader who may be inclined to doubt the truth of my story of how the manuscript of the following pages came into my possession. I am quite aware that to some the tale will appear absolutely and intolerably impossible. I know that if any other than I told it to me I should not believe it. Yet despite these drawbacks the story is in all particulars, essential and otherwise, absolutely truthful.  The facts are briefly these:  It was not, to begin with, a dark and dismal evening. The snow was not falling silently, clothing a sad and gloomy world in a mantle of white, and over the darkling moor a heavy mist was not rising, as is so frequently the case. There was no soul-stirring moaning of bitter winds through the leafless boughs; so far as I was aware nothing soughed within twenty miles of my bailiwick; and my dog, lying before a blazing log fire in my library, did not give forth an occasional growl of apprehension, denoting the presence or approach of an uncanny visitor from other and mysterious realms: and for two good reasons. The first reason is that it was midsummer when the thing happened, so that a blazing log fire in my library would have been an extravagance as well as an"]]]
