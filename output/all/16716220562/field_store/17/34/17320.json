Sunflower seeds have a high percentage of indigestible residue.  In both popular accounts and scientific studies, the economic significance of the consumption of weed seeds such as those of sunflowers by birds often has been interpreted in an oversimplified manner. It has been assumed that if crows eat several million sunflower seeds in the winter, the sunflowers growing in the farmers' fields the next year will have been reduced by the same number. However, like most annual plants, sunflowers produce a great surplus of seeds each year. Most of the seeds consumed by crows would never have a chance to grow to maturity, even if they were not eaten. Therefore this component of the crow's diet is only slightly beneficial or neutral for the farmer. The effect of crows (or of the entire bird population for that matter) upon the sunflower crop in the farmers' fields is probably slight.  Corn is one of the preferred foods of crows, but little corn was grown in the study area. Other investigators have found higher percentages elsewhere. In eastern Harvey County corn reached its highest point in December but was insignificant in the diet. In the western part of the study area it made up a larger percentage of the diet of wintering crows. The corn eaten early in the season was undoubtedly from the standing crop. However, most of that picked up in late autumn and in winter was waste grain. Since little corn was shocked and left in the fields, there was less opportunity for damage. The amount of corn pulling at planting time was not determined, since no pellets were collected then. However, the population of crows at that time was low. I received no complaints of such damage to corn nor of significant damage to the corn crop at other seasons.  There were pastures of brome grass in the area under study in eastern Harvey County, and the seeds seemed to be a preferred food, constituting a major food supply for the crows in the latter part of July and the first part of August. Having a high content of indigestible residues they probably showed up in the pellets in percentages out of proportion to their importance in the diet. They were unimportant in the diet of wintering crows in the western part of the study area. This component of brome grass in the diet was economically of little significance in the study area, although it could be of significance where brome grass seed was being harvested.  Cherries were recorded only in June and only from one family of crows in eastern Harvey County; cherry orchards are few in this area. The damage done by the crows in the cherry orchard was slight, since only a few crows fed there.  Weed seeds such as those of spurges (_Euphorbia_), ragweed, and pigweed were found in trace amounts in the diet of the crows. However, they were not preferred foods, since they were available in large quantities.  Wild fruits such as grape and pokeberry also showed up in trace amounts. Elsewhere, investigators have found wild fruit forming a major source of food in winter. However, it was not readily available in this area.  Plant fibers and seeds unidentifiable with the resources at hand formed 2.2 per cent of the residues.  It was reported to me that crows caused damage to watermelons which are extensively grown in the sandhills region but no residues of this crop were found in any pellets collected.  Insects were most important in the animal portion of the food. The economic and ecologic significance of insects in the diet of birds is often oversimplified. The effects of predation upon animal populations are complex, and predation is often a by-product of population rather than a controlling factor.  A female insect eaten before oviposition has a greater ecologic significance than one eaten after she has laid her eggs and is ready to die.  Beetles made up more than half of the insect component of the diet. Scarabaeids were readily recognizable. Other beetles were classified as predaceous or non-predaceous according to the type of mandibles found. When mandibles were lacking the occurrences were listed merely as unclassified beetles, and those made up 5.6 per cent of the yearly food residues. Predaceous beetles made up 3.3 per cent, whereas non-predaceous beetles made up only 1.3 per cent. Both were found in one-half of the collecting periods. Predaceous and non-predaceous beetles formed 1.2 per cent of the yearly food residues. This preponderance of predaceous beetle material is what might be expected from the manner in which crows feed. Many predaceous ground beetles of the family Carabidae would be found under rocks and clods and on the ground.  Beetles were a constant component of the diet in summer. They reached a peak of 48.7 per cent in the last part of July. In November the percentage declined and by December they formed only 2.5 per cent of the diet.  Scarabaeid beetles were utilized in large quantities when they were most abundant; they made up 28.7 per cent of the diet in the latter part of June. The larvae of scarabaeid beetles are destructive to wheat and alfalfa and live in the ground from one to three years before metamorphosing into adult beetles. Adults emerge from the ground from April to mid-August, the maximum flight occurring in May and June. Most of the eggs are laid from the last of May to the middle of July (Hayes, 1920:306). Afterward the adults soon die. Many of the beetles are nocturnal, but some of the more important destructive forms are diurnal (Hayes, 1918:142). Crows pick up the diurnal forms when they are active and perhaps find the nocturnal forms under clods or in burrows and eat them in ecologically significant numbers.  Crows are beneficial to the farmer insofar as they control the populations of scarabaeids and other non-predaceous beetles. However, destruction of predaceous beetles is harmful to the farmers' best interests.  Grasshoppers, second only to beetles in the insect component of the diet, are among the most destructive insects in Kansas. Eggs laid in autumn overwinter and hatch the next summer, from April to August, depending upon the species. The maximum numbers of grasshoppers are present in late summer and early autumn and they continue feeding on crops until the first killing frost. The greatest damage is caused by the destruction of the foliage of corn, wheat, and alfalfa (Smith, _et al._, 1943:126). The consumption of grasshoppers closely followed the curve of their availability, since they are a preferred food of the crow. They were picked up in small quantities even in winter. In summer they made up 6 to 10 per cent of the diet of the crows in eastern Harvey County. Through the late summer and autumn this percentage rose, until during the first half of October they made up 59.6 per cent of the diet. However, in the western part of the study area, they constituted a smaller part of the diet.  Predation upon grasshoppers, especially in summer and early autumn, benefits the farmer by helping to stabilize populations of grasshoppers. However, when grasshopper consumption was highest, in early October, many of those eaten probably already had completed their breeding cycle, and their consumption was hence of little significance economically or ecologically.  Ants were consumed only in September and October when they constituted as much as 14.9 per cent of the diet. Crows may make an entire meal from a large colony; at any rate, whenever ants were found in a pellet, they constituted a large percentage of it.  Miscellaneous insect remains constituted two-tenths of one per cent of the yearly diet. Hemipteran remains were present only in trace quantities (.5 per cent of the July 13-26 sample from eastern Harvey County).  Only a few questionable fragments from insect larvae were found in the pellets collected in the course of this study. However, as mentioned earlier, there is evidence that larvae constituted a major food supply during much of the summer.  Many investigators have found that crows feed on grubs and caterpillars (Aldous, 1944; Alexander, 1930; Lemaire, 1950; Kalmbach, 1918; Barrows and Schwarz, 1895). A number of county agents with whom I had correspondence mentioned that crows aided the farmer in this way. More investigation is required to determine the significance of crow predation upon insect larvae in this area. Most of the bone material recorded was fragmentary. Phalangeal or podial elements of rodents and various bones of rabbits were identified. The only teeth identified were those of the genus _Rattus_. Barrows and Schwarz (1895:24-25) found that small bones of mammals may be completely ground up and digested by the crow. Hence the amount of food furnished by mammals, either alive or as carrion, may be higher than my figures indicate.  Bones of birds were found in only one pellet, obtained in early July. However, few pellets were collected in the nesting season.  The eggshell occurring in the pellets probably was indicative of extensive feeding on dumping grounds, and I received no reports of eggs lost to crows on poultry farms. Such damage has been reduced to a minimum since most poultry flocks are well-housed.  The percentage of aquatic animals (fish, crayfish and snail) in the diet increased during the early autumn, as the creeks dried up in eastern Harvey County, but after mid-October declined rapidly, as all the pools were then gone.   Conclusions  The large wintering flocks of crows are important consumers of grain sorghums in south-central Kansas. In the early autumn when the crow population is building up, it damages the sorghum crop before harvest. The damage varies from year to year, being much more keenly felt in dry years when the crop is poor or in years when the crop is late. However, most of the sorghums, which are the principal item of diet of these wintering crows, are waste grain taken from the fields after harvest. Some of this waste grain taken should be counted as a loss because the farmer "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33545"],["title","Food of the Crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos Brehm, in South-central Kansas (#3)"],["body","normally let his livestock utilize it.  Crows use newly sown oat fields as a major source of food during the late winter and early spring. However, damage to the crop is slight. Corn is not an important crop in this area. The crow population is low at the season when corn is planted, so probably little damage is done at this time. Much of the corn eaten in winter is waste grain. Feeding on wheat is of little economic importance, since most of that taken is waste grain. Feeding on sunflower seeds may be counted as neutral to slightly beneficial. Damage to watermelons, which are extensively grown in the sandhills region, may be important at times. Crow feeding upon other crops is only locally significant.  Although it has food preferences, the crow is euryphagous, and its diet is governed to a large extent by the availability of various types of food in its habitat. Therefore, in its ecologic relationships with many other species, it is a density dependent predator. It reduces the numbers of a certain species when the latter becomes unusually abundant but lessens the mortality pressure against it when the prey population is low. Predators of this type tend to maintain stability in a community in contrast to the violent oscillations often caused by a more stenophagous predator. This study indicates that in south-central Kansas crows help to stabilize the populations of grasshoppers, ground-dwelling beetles both predaceous and non-predaceous, and probably those of other types of insects whose soil dwelling larvae are subject to predation during summer plowing.  Crows also serve as scavengers, feeding on carrion and at dumping grounds, as indicated by the high frequency of eggshell and mammalian bone in the diet. Bird bones were found in an insignificant amount in this study, but extensive collections were not made during the main nesting season.   Summary  An intensive study of the yearly diet of crows was carried on from December, 1952, to February, 1954, in Harvey County and the northeastern townships of Reno County, Kansas, in order to discover some of the ecologic and economic relationships of the population of crows in south-central Kansas. The study is based upon the analysis of 617 regurgitated pellets collected throughout the year. Data obtained from this analysis have been correlated with field observations on crows and habitat changes.  The area is in the zone of transition between tall-grass and short-grass prairie, and the predominant agricultural crop is wheat. The study area supports a breeding population of approximately one pair of crows per square mile, but large flocks of wintering crows move into the western part of the area near the Arkansas River Valley.  Plant material amounted to 69.0 per cent of the pellet residues. Wheat is the food taken in greatest amount in the yearly average, but the staple foods of the wintering crows are grain sorghum, sunflower seeds, and corn. Crows use newly sown oat fields as a major source of food in late winter and early spring, but damage to the crop seems to be slight. Growers of grain sorghum and, locally, growers of corn and watermelons, sustain serious damage from crows.  Being euryphagous, crows exert a stabilizing influence on many kinds of prey and on the biotic community as a whole. This study indicates that their effects are especially important in helping to stabilize the populations of grasshoppers and of ground-dwelling beetles, and possibly those of some other insects that have soil-dwelling larvae.  Carrion and material from dumping grounds furnish another fairly constant component of the crow's diet.   TABLE 1.
