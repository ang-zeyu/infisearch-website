All this was devised and brought to light by the author, Francesco Borghesi of An√°uni, a secular priest of Trent, A.A.L.L. & Doctor of Philosophy. (Trent: From the printshop of Giovanni Battista Monauni, With Permission of Superiors.)\" (_Title page reproduced by permission of the Biblioteca della Citta di Trento._)]  Again and again, Bertolla threw up his hands in despair and begged Father Borghesi to abandon the enterprise. He protested that he was not capable of producing such a complicated mechanism; he had neither the tools nor the skill. The priest wished to produce a clock such as the world had never seen before, such as the greatest scientists and clockmakers of all time had never been able to make. But Bertolla felt that he was only a provincial craftsman who could not hope to surpass them all with only his simple tools and training.  In his book on the first clock, _Novissima Ac Perpetua Astronomica..._, Father Borghesi wrote that when he had finally come within a few weeks of the embryo stage in the development of his clock, he was faced with the problem of bolstering the sagging enthusiasm of Bertolla. The clockmaker's original enthusiasm had shown promise of great results, but as the days passed and the problems of the multiplex and generally unfamiliar apparatus to be forged for the workings of the automaton became more complex, his ardor decreased. Finally, Bertolla became so discouraged by the scoffers and frustrated by the fact that the work was insufficiently organized that Father Borghesi wrote that \"it almost became a harder task for me to bolster up by daily opportunity and importunity the failing patience of the artisan, frightened away from the work already begun, than it was for me to extract from the inner recesses of mathematics and astronomy, without light and without a guide, the whole fabric of the machine itself!\"  In spite of Bertolla's protests, Father Borghesi prevailed, reviving his friend's interest once more until the two were deep in the project again. Months passed as they worked together on the mechanism and it seemed as if they lived for no other purpose. Inevitably, Bertolla's health began to suffer, undermined as it was by the constant nervous tension, and he eventually became ill from mental strain. He was forced to spend some time in bed, and for many weeks the subject of the clock was not discussed. Bertolla's other work, by which he made his living, suffered and it was several months before he was able to return to his little shop.  One year passed into another and the work progressed slowly. The first clock, which easily should have been finished in less than a year, was not completed until after three full years had passed. However, when the priest and the clockmaker put the finishing touches to their great clock, the result surpassed the greatest possible expectations, for it was truly a masterpiece. Not only did it illustrate the ecliptic phenomena of the moon, the sun and earth occurring in their proper time, as well as many other things, but it showed these operations as they succeeded in proper order, taking place through the centuries.  With mutual feelings of great pride, the two friends surveyed the result of their three years of endeavor. Bertolla realized that he had reached a point of maximum achievement in his work. He probably felt that now he could relax again, that his sleep would no longer be troubled by confused nightmares of wheels and gears that did not mesh together. Time was to prove otherwise.   PUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST CLOCK  Father Borghesi soon came to the conclusion that it would be desirable to have a written description to explain the mechanism of the clock and its many indicators. He thereupon wrote out the story of how the clock was made, the reasons for embarking on the enterprise, the difficulties he had encountered, and the success which had crowned his and Bertolla's mutual labors. Finally, he described the operation of the clock's mechanism and the functions of its array of indicators.  The little book was written in Latin and only a few copies were printed, presumably at the priest's own expense, on a handpress by Giovanni Battista Monauni, printer to the Bishop in Trent. The little volume was stated by contemporary writers to have been published in 1763, although no date appears on the title page. The title translated is, in part, _The Most Recent, Perpetual Astronomical Calendar Clock, Theoretical--Practical...._ The work begins with an introduction for the reader in which Father Borghesi stated that:       ... the little work, which, as far as I was concerned could      easily have been finished in a year, was only completed after      about three years. Fortunately, however, it was so far beyond      the expectations of most, that not only am I able to foretell      with certainty all the lunar ecliptic phenomena and the solar,      or rather terrestrial, phenomena, carefully worked out in their      true periods, among many other matters exhibited by the      machine; but also, within a few hours, I can exhibit by      altogether tangible evidence to the skeptics and the doubting      those very same phenomena, occurring within the space of many      years, or even centuries, and succeeding one another in proper      order, with their many attendant circumstances. I was not much      concerned about the other eclipses, such as those of Mercury,      Venus, and the other stars wandering through the zodiac, or      about the other solar eclipses from the transit of Mercury or      Venus, since they are altogether undiscernible to the naked      eye, and very few compilers of ephemerides wish them to be      noted, probably for the same reason.       Do not, however, expect, star-loving reader, that here anything      at all that you may wish can be drawn forth as from its source,      for to demand this would be almost the same as to seek to drain      as from a cup all the vast knowledge of the many arithmetical      sciences from the narrow confines of one book. You will      understand how impossible that is when, through prolonged      labor, you have grown somewhat more mature in this kind of      learning.       Wherefore, rather fully, and out of consideration for you, I      have decided, setting aside these prolixities, with completely      synoptic brevity and with all possible clarity to expound for      you simply the proportion of the movements, the description of      the machine, and its usage. As a result, when you have      progressed a little in theoretical mechanics, you will not only      be able to reduce all these things to their astronomical      principles, but you may find the way more smoothly laid out for      you even for perfecting the machine itself. And, thus, you may      be more effectively encouraged to a successful conclusion. Let      it be so now for you through the following 10 chapters!  After these rather hopeful assurances, Father Borghesi proceeded to provide a detailed description of the clock dial and functions in the 10 short chapters which he had promised, under a separate section entitled \"Synopsis Totius Operis Mechanici,\" which is translated in its entirety in the appendix.  As Father Borghesi prepared his little volume about his first clock, and described its unusual features and outlined its functions, which were primarily to place in evidence the celestial constellations, it occurred to him that it would now be easier after the experience he had acquired with his first timepiece, to construct another clock, which would present the motions of the two astronomical systems, the Ptolemaic and the Copernican. In this first book, he promised the reader that he would undertake the second project. It is fortunate that Father Borghesi undertook this project for the second clock is the only example of his work that is known to exist today. Extensive research has not shown what happened to the first clock, although several sources state that both timepieces were presented to Empress Maria Theresa sometime between 1764 and 1780.     Second Borghesi Clock   Father Borghesi lost no time in initiating the project of the second clock. The first and most important step was to inform Bertolla and enlist his assistance. Bertolla was adamant: he had had enough of complicated astronomical movements. He was delighted by the prospect of returning to his former simple life, producing simple, domestic, elementary movements for his country clients. Father Borghesi begged and cajoled. The second clock would be a much simpler one to construct, he persisted. After all, they had gained invaluable experience from the production of the first clock. Furthermore, he had already completed its design.  Bertolla apparently wavered in his resolve and, unwillingly and against his better judgment, he allowed the priest's inducements to prevail. Once again, the two friends yielded their leisure hours to a study of the priest's books and drawings as Father Borghesi enthusiastically elaborated his design for the timepiece, and Bertolla attempted to transcribe astronomical indications into terms of wheel counts. The second clock was, as Borghesi had promised, much easier of execution. Within a year, it was completed and functioned with complete success.

It is housed in a tall case of dark-red mahogany veneered on oak, with restrained carving featuring ribands and foliate motifs. Gilt-brass decorations flank the face of the hood, which is surmounted by three gilt-brass finials in the form of orbs. A wide door in the waist may be opened to attend the weights. The case is 7 feet 8 inches high, 20-1/2 inches wide at the waist, and 14 inches in depth.  The dial is of gilt brass, measuring 21 inches high and 15 inches in width, with a number of supplementary silvered dials visible through its openings. Instead of hands, the dial utilizes three concentric rings moving around a central disc, the indications of which are read at two bisecting gilt lines inscribed in the glass face. Twelve separate functions are performed by the chapter ring assembly alone, and there are 14 openings on the dial. It is estimated that the clock performs 30 separate functions, including striking and chiming. Of the multiple chapter rings, the outermost is 1-1/8 inches wide, the center ring is 3/8 inch wide, and the innermost ring measures 1-1/4 inches in width.   THE DIAL-PLATE ENGRAVINGS  The gilt dial is incised throughout with figures and inscriptions in engraving of the very finest quality, as is evidenced in the illustrations. The frontispiece is surmounted at its center by the crowned double eagle of the House of Hapsburg, indicating the identity of the sovereign in whose reign it was made, Emperor Francis I or the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Below the eagle at either side are flying cherubs supporting ribands with inscriptions. Centered at the bottom of the frontispiece immediately above the chapter rings is the moving silvered orb representing the sun. Surrounding it is a tableau of the Holy Trinity, with the Virgin Mary being crowned by Christ holding a cross at the left and God with a sword in hand at the right, and a dove representing the Holy Spirit hovering over the Virgin's head. Father S. X. Winters, S.J., considers it reminiscent of the triptych \"The Coronation of the Virgin\" by Fra Lippo Lippi.

In the upper spandrels of the dial are two more cherubs bearing ribands with inscriptions. In the lower left corner is a magnificent engraving of Atlas upholding the globe of the world, inscribed with the zodiac, over his head. The lower right corner features the figures of two noblemen apparently examining and discussing an orb upon a table, the significance of which is not clear.  [Illustration: Figure 12.--EMPRESS MARIA THERESA, to whom Father Borghesi is stated to have presented his two astronomical clocks. The coin bearing her portrait is in the Museum of History and Technology.]   THE INSCRIPTIONS  Beginning with the uppermost part of the frontispiece, there are nine inscriptions in Latin on the dial plate. The topmost is _Franciscvs I sit plan. Dominator aeternvs._ The phrase has reference to Francis I, who was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, from 1745-1765, and husband of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The phrase may be translated as \"May Francis I be the eternal ruler by favor of the planets\" or more simply \"Long Live Francis I, Emperor.\"[14] Although the dial plate of the Borghesi clock is inscribed with his name, the records indicate that the clock was presented to Maria Theresa. Francis I may have already died before the presentation was made.  [Illustration: Figure 13.--PORTRAIT OF FRANCIS I, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, to whom Father Borghesi's astronomical clock in the Museum of History and Technology appears to have been inscribed.]  From the left to right over the tableau of the Holy Trinity is the phrase \"Lavs sacrosanctae Triadi Vni Deo, et Deiparae\" (Praise [be] to the most Holy Trinity, to the one God, and to the Mother of God).  Within the upper left and right spandrels is inscribed:       Isthaec, Signum grande apparvit in Coelo * sancta Dei genitrix      amicta sole * Illibato pede Lvnae et serpentis nigra premens      Cornva * bis senis pvlcherrime Coronata syderibvs * Tempe      indesinenter clavsa, scatvrigo signata * Cedrvs in Libano,      Cypresvs in Monte Sion * Mater pvrae Dilectionis sanctaeqve      spei * Chara patris aeterni proles, Verbi Mater, sponsaqve      procedentis *, gratiae et gloriae circvmdata varietate.  This inscription is a eulogy to the Virgin Mary assembled from the texts of Holy Scripture. In addition, each _lemma_, contained within asterisks, carries out the chronogram 1764, the year the clock was completed. Each _lemma_ is translated and identified from the Douay-Rheims version of the Bible:       This woman: a great sign appeared in Heaven (Apocalypse 12:1) *      The Holy Mother of God clothed with the sun (Apocalypse 12:1) *      And with unharmed foot crushing the black horns of the moon      (Apocalypse 12:1) and the serpent (Genesis 3:15) * Most      beautifully crowned with twice-six (Apocalypse 12:1) * A garden      [_Tempe_[15]] enclosed, sealed with a fountain [spring of      water] (Song of Songs 4:12) * Like a cedar in Lebanon, and a      cypress tree on Mount Zion; (Ecclesiasticus 24:17) * Mother of      pure love and of holy hope: Beloved daughter of the Eternal      Father, Mother of the Word, Spouse of the Holy Spirit:      (Ecclesiasticus 24:24) * Surrounded with a diversity of grace      and glory (Psalms 44:10).  [Illustration: Figure 14.--THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER of the dial plate, showing two noblemen contemplating an orb, with the inscription \"Diligit Avdaces Trepidos Fortvna Repellet.\" (Fortune favors the daring and rejects the timid.)]  At the lower left corner below the figure of Atlas upholding the world is the phrase, _Assidvo proni donant di cvncta labori_. (The favorable gods willingly grant all things to the assiduous laborer.) The same phrase is quoted by Father Borghesi in the text of his second volume. The last inscription appears at the lower right corner under the figures of the two noblemen, _Diligit avdaces trepidos fortvna repellet_. (Fortune favors the daring and rejects the timid.) The last two inscriptions are in dactylic hexameter. They appear to be original compositions inasmuch as no classical prototypes have been identified.  [Illustration: Figure 15.--THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER of the dial plate, showing the engraving of Atlas, with the inscription \"Assidvo proni donant di cvncta labori.\" (The favorable gods willingly grant all things to the assiduous laborer.)]   CENTER DIAL INSCRIPTIONS  [Illustration: Figure 16.--DETAIL OF FRONTISPIECE of the Borghesi clock, showing the apertures for calendar indicators and the details of the engraving.]  In addition to the inscriptions previously noted on the outer dial plate, there are three major inscriptions in the central dial. The outermost states _Circulus horarius Soli_, _Lunae_, _Fixis_, _Nodis_, _Aestuique marino communis_ (the hour circle, common to the sun, the moon, the fixed stars, the nodes and to the sea tide). This inscription is divided into four parts by the insertion of four divisions for the day into canonical hours: [_Horae_] _Nocturnae_ (night hours); _Matutinae_ (morning hours); _Diurnae_ (daytime hours) and _Vespertinae_ (evening hours).  The next section of the central dial is inscribed _Intumescite--Detumescite_ (rise and fall of the tides) repeated at intervals of approximately every six hours. Within the next section is the following inscription, inscribed continuously around the ring:       Lege fluunt, refluunt, dormitant hac maris undae: Ad Phoebi et      Phoebes concordia iussa moventur Aequora; discordi iussu      suspensa quiescunt.  Translated, this is:       By this law the sea waves ebb and flow and lie dormant: When      Phoebus and Diana agree in their commands, the waters are      moved; when they disagree, the waters lie silent.[16]  Within the central boss of the dial"]]]
