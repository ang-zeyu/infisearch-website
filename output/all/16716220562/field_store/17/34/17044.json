This exhibition of primordial fury chilled the blood in Valeria's veins, but Conan was too close to the primitive himself to feel anything but a comprehending interest. To the barbarian, no such gulf existed between himself and other men, and the animals, as existed in the conception of Valeria. The monster below them, to Conan, was merely a form of life differing from himself mainly in physical shape. He attributed to it characteristics similar to his own, and saw in its wrath a counterpart of his rages, in its roars and bellowings merely reptilian equivalents to the curses he had bestowed upon it. Feeling a kinship with all wild things, even dragons, it was impossible for him to experience the sick horror which assailed Valeria at the sight of the brute's ferocity.  He sat watching it tranquilly, and pointed out the various changes that were taking place in its voice and actions.  \"The poison's taking hold,\" he said with conviction.  \"I don't believe it.\" To Valeria it seemed preposterous to suppose that anything, however lethal, could have any effect on that mountain of muscle and fury.  \"There's pain in his voice,\" declared Conan. \"First he was merely angry because of the stinging in his jaw. Now he feels the bite of the poison. Look! He's staggering. He'll be blind in a few more minutes. What did I tell you?\"  For suddenly the dragon had lurched about and went crashing off through the bushes.  \"Is he running away?\" inquired Valeria uneasily.  \"He's making for the pool!\" Conan sprang up, galvanized into swift activity. \"The poison makes him thirsty. Come on! He'll be blind in a few moments, but he can smell his way back to the foot of the crag, and if our scent's here still, he'll sit there until he dies. And others of his kind may come at his cries. Let's go!\"  \"Down there?\" Valeria was aghast.  \"Sure! We'll make for the city! They may cut our heads off there, but it's our only chance. We may run into a thousand more dragons on the way, but it's sure death to stay here. If we wait until he dies, we may have a dozen more to deal with. After me, in a hurry!\"  He went down the ramp as swiftly as an ape, pausing only to aid his less agile companion, who, until she saw the Cimmerian climb, had fancied herself the equal of any man in the rigging of a ship or on the sheer face of a cliff.         *       *       *       *       *  They descended into the gloom below the branches and slid to the ground silently, though Valeria felt as if the pounding of her heart must surely be heard from far away. A noisy gurgling and lapping beyond the dense thicket indicated that the dragon was drinking at the pool.  \"As soon as his belly is full he'll be back,\" muttered Conan. \"It may take hours for the poison to kill him--if it does at all.\"  Somewhere beyond the forest the sun was sinking to the horizon. The forest was a misty twilight place of black shadows and dim vistas. Conan gripped Valeria's wrist and glided away from the foot of the crag. He made less noise than a breeze blowing among the tree-trunks, but Valeria felt as if her soft boots were betraying their flight to all the forest.  \"I don't think he can follow a trail,\" muttered Conan. \"But if a wind blew our body-scent to him, he could smell us out.\"  \"Mitra grant that the wind blow not!\" Valeria breathed.  Her face was a pallid oval in the gloom. She gripped her sword in her free hand, but the feel of the shagreen-bound hilt inspired only a feeling of helplessness in her.  They were still some distance from the edge of the forest when they heard a snapping and crashing behind them. Valeria bit her lip to check a cry.  \"He's on our trail!\" she whispered fiercely.  Conan shook his head.  \"He didn't smell us at the rock, and he's blundering about through the forest trying to pick up our scent. Come on! It's the city or nothing now! He could tear down any tree we'd climb. If only the wind stays down----\"  They stole on until the trees began to thin out ahead of them. Behind them the forest was a black impenetrable ocean of shadows. The ominous crackling still sounded behind them, as the dragon blundered in his erratic course.  \"There's the plain ahead,\" breathed Valeria. \"A little more and we'll----\"  \"Crom!\" swore Conan.  \"Mitra!\" whispered Valeria.  Out of the south a wind had sprung up.  It blew over them directly into the black forest behind them. Instantly a horrible roar shook the woods. The aimless snapping and crackling of the bushes changed to a sustained crashing as the dragon came like a hurricane straight toward the spot from which the scent of his enemies was wafted.  \"Run!\" snarled Conan, his eyes blazing like those of a trapped wolf. \"It's all we can do!\"  Sailor's boots are not made for sprinting, and the life of a pirate does not train one for a runner. Within a hundred yards Valeria was panting and reeling in her gait, and behind them the crashing gave way to a rolling thunder as the monster broke out of the thickets and into the more open ground.  Conan's iron arm about the woman's waist half lifted her; her feet scarcely touched the earth as she was borne along at a speed she could never have attained herself. If he could keep out of the beast's way for a bit, perhaps that betraying wind would shift--but the wind held, and a quick glance over his shoulder showed Conan that the monster was almost upon them, coming like a war-galley in front of a hurricane. He thrust Valeria from him with a force that sent her reeling a dozen feet to fall in a crumpled heap at the foot of the nearest tree, and the Cimmerian wheeled in the path of the thundering titan.  Convinced that his death was upon him, the Cimmerian acted according to his instinct, and hurled himself full at the awful face that was bearing down on him. He leaped, slashing like a wildcat, felt his sword cut deep into the scales that sheathed the mighty snout--and then a terrific impact knocked him rolling and tumbling for fifty feet with all the wind and half the life battered out of him.  How the stunned Cimmerian regained his feet, not even he could have ever told. But the only thought that filled his brain was of the woman lying dazed and helpless almost in the path of the hurtling fiend, and before the breath came whistling back into his gullet he was standing over her with his sword in his hand.  She lay where he had thrown her, but she was struggling to a sitting posture. Neither tearing tusks nor trampling feet had touched her. It had been a shoulder or front leg that struck Conan, and the blind monster rushed on, forgetting the victims whose scent it had been following, in the sudden agony of its death throes. Headlong on its course it thundered until its low-hung head crashed into a gigantic tree in its path. The impact tore the tree up by the roots and must have dashed the brains from the misshapen skull. Tree and monster fell together, and the dazed humans saw the branches and leaves shaken by the convulsions of the creature they covered--and then grow quiet.  Conan lifted Valeria to her feet and together they started away at a reeling run. A few moments later they emerged into the still twilight of the treeless plain.         *       *       *       *       *  Conan paused an instant and glanced back at the ebon fastness behind them. Not a leaf stirred, nor a bird chirped. It stood as silent as it must have stood before Man was created.  \"Come on,\" muttered Conan, taking his companion's hand. \"It's touch and go now. If more dragons come out of the woods after us----\"  He did not have to finish the sentence.  The city looked very far away across the plain, farther than it had looked from the crag. Valeria's heart hammered until she felt as if it would strangle her. At every step she expected to hear the crashing of the bushes and see another colossal nightmare bearing down upon them. But nothing disturbed the silence of the thickets.  With the first mile between them and the woods, Valeria breathed more easily. Her buoyant self-confidence began to thaw out again. The sun had set and darkness was gathering over the plain, lightened a little by the stars that made stunted ghosts out of the cactus growths.  \"No cattle, no plowed fields,\" muttered Conan. \"How do these people live?\"  \"Perhaps the cattle are in pens for the night,\" suggested Valeria, \"and the fields and grazing-pastures are on the other side of the city.\"  \"Maybe,\" he grunted. \"I didn't see any from the crag, though.\"  The moon came up behind the city, etching walls and towers blackly in the yellow glow. Valeria shivered. Black against the moon the strange city had a somber, sinister look.  Perhaps something of the same feeling occurred to Conan, for he stopped, glanced about him, and grunted: \"We stop here. No use coming to their gates in the night. They probably wouldn't let us in. Besides, we need rest, and we don't know how they'll receive us. A few hours' sleep will put us in better shape to fight or run.\"  He led the way to a bed of cactus which grew in a circle--a phenomenon common to the southern desert. With his sword he chopped an opening, and motioned Valeria to enter.  \"We'll be safe from snakes here, anyhow.\"  She glanced fearfully back toward the black line that indicated the forest some six miles away.  \"Suppose a dragon comes out of the woods?\"  \"We'll keep watch,\" he answered, though he made no suggestion as to what they would do in such an event. He was staring at the city, a few miles away. Not a light shone from spire or tower. A great black mass of mystery, it reared cryptically against the moonlit sky.  \"Lie down and sleep. I'll keep the first watch.\"  She hesitated, glancing at him uncertainly, but he sat down cross-legged in the opening, facing toward the plain, his sword across his knees, his back to her. Without further comment she lay down on the sand inside the spiky circle.  \"Wake me when "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32759"],["title","Red Nails (#4)"],["body","moon is at its zenith,\" she directed.  He did not reply nor look toward her. Her last impression, as she sank into slumber, was of his muscular figure, immobile as a statue hewn out of bronze, outlined against the low-hanging stars.     _2. By the Blaze of the Fire-Jewels_   Valeria awoke with a start, to the realization that a gray dawn was stealing over the plain.  She sat up, rubbing her eyes. Conan squatted beside the cactus, cutting off the thick pears and dexterously twitching out the spikes.  \"You didn't awake me,\" she accused. \"You let me sleep all night!\"  \"You were tired,\" he answered. \"Your posterior must have been sore, too, after that long ride. You pirates aren't used to horseback.\"  \"What about yourself?\" she retorted.  \"I was a _kozak_ before I was a pirate,\" he answered. \"They live in the saddle. I snatch naps like a panther watching beside the trail for a deer to come by. My ears keep watch while my eyes sleep.\"  And indeed the giant barbarian seemed as much refreshed as if he had slept the whole night on a golden bed. Having removed the thorns, and peeled off the tough skin, he handed the girl a thick, juicy cactus leaf.  \"Skin your teeth in that pear. It's food and drink to a desert man. I was a chief of the Zuagirs once--desert men who live by plundering the caravans.\"  \"Is there anything you haven't been?\" inquired the girl, half in derision and half in fascination.  \"I've never been king of an Hyborian kingdom,\" he grinned, taking an enormous mouthful of cactus. \"But I've dreamed of being even that. I may be too, some day. Why shouldn't I?\"  She shook her head in wonder at his calm audacity, and fell to devouring her pear. She found it not unpleasing to the palate, and full of cool and thirst-satisfying juice. Finishing his meal, Conan wiped his hands in the sand, rose, ran his fingers through his thick black mane, hitched at his sword-belt and said:  \"Well, let's go. If the people in that city are going to cut our throats they may as well do it now, before the heat of the day begins.\"  His grim humor was unconscious, but Valeria reflected that it might be prophetic. She too hitched her sword-belt as she rose. Her terrors of the night were past. The roaring dragons of the distant forest were like a dim dream. There was a swagger in her stride as she moved off beside the Cimmerian. Whatever perils lay ahead of them, their foes would be men. And Valeria of the Red Brotherhood had never seen the face of the man she feared.  Conan glanced down at her as she strode along beside him with her swinging stride that matched his own.  \"You walk more like a hillman than a sailor,\" he said. \"You must be an Aquilonian. The suns of Darfar never burnt your white skin brown. Many a princess would envy you.\"  \"I am from Aquilonia,\" she replied. His compliments no longer irritated her. His evident admiration pleased her. For another man to have kept her watch while she slept would have angered her; she had always fiercely resented any man's attempting to shield or protect her because of her sex. But she found a secret pleasure in the fact that this man had done so. And he had not taken advantage of her fright and the weakness resulting from it. After all, she reflected, her companion was no common man.         *       *       *       *       *  The sun rose behind the city, turning the towers to a sinister crimson.  \"Black last night against the moon,\" grunted Conan, his eyes clouding with the abysmal superstition of the barbarian. \"Blood-red as a threat of blood against the sun this dawn. I do not like this city.\"  But they went on, and as they went Conan pointed out the fact that no road ran to the city from the north.  \"No cattle have trampled the plain on this side of the city,\" said he. \"No plowshare has touched the earth for years, maybe centuries. But look: once this plain was cultivated.\"  Valeria saw the ancient irrigation ditches he indicated, half filled in places, and overgrown with cactus. She frowned with perplexity as her eyes swept over the plain that stretched on all sides of the city to the forest edge, which marched in a vast, dim ring. Vision did not extend beyond that ring.  She looked uneasily at the city. No helmets or spear-heads gleamed on battlements, no trumpets sounded, no challenge rang from the towers. A silence as absolute as that of the forest brooded over the walls and minarets.  The sun was high above the eastern horizon when they stood before the great gate in the northern wall, in the shadow of the lofty rampart. Rust flecked the iron bracings of the mighty bronze portal. Spiderwebs glistened thickly on hinge and sill and bolted panel.  \"It hasn't been opened for years!\" exclaimed Valeria.  \"A dead city,\" grunted Conan. \"That's why the ditches were broken and the plain untouched.\"  \"But who built it? Who dwelt here? Where did they go? Why did they abandon it?\"  \"Who can say? Maybe an exiled clan of Stygians built it. Maybe not. It doesn't look like Stygian architecture. Maybe the people were wiped out by enemies, or a plague exterminated them.\"  \"In that case their treasures may still be gathering dust and cobwebs in there,\" suggested Valeria, the acquisitive instincts of her profession waking in her; prodded, too, by feminine curiosity. \"Can we open the gate? Let's go in and explore a bit.\"  Conan eyed the heavy portal dubiously, but placed his massive shoulder against it and thrust with all the power of his muscular calves and thighs. With a rasping screech of rusty hinges the gate moved ponderously inward, and Conan straightened and drew his sword. Valeria stared over his shoulder, and made a sound indicative of surprise.  They were not looking into an open street or court as one would have expected. The opened gate, or door, gave directly into a long, broad hall which ran away and away until its vista grew indistinct in the distance. It was of heroic proportions, and the floor of a curious red stone, cut in square tiles, that seemed to smolder as if with the reflection of flames. The walls were of a shiny green material.  \"Jade, or I'm a Shemite!\" swore Conan.  \"Not in such quantity!\" protested Valeria.  \"I've looted enough from the Khitan caravans to know what I'm talking about,\" he asserted. \"That's jade!\"  The vaulted ceiling was of lapis lazuli, adorned with clusters of great green stones that gleamed with a poisonous radiance.  \"Green fire-stones,\" growled Conan. \"That's what the people of Punt call them. They're supposed to be the petrified eyes of those prehistoric snakes the ancients called Golden Serpents. They glow like a cat's eyes in the dark. At night this hall would be lighted by them, but it would be a hellishly weird illumination. Let's look around. We might find a cache of jewels.\"  \"Shut the door,\" advised Valeria. \"I'd hate to have to outrun a dragon down this hall.\"  Conan grinned, and replied: \"I don't believe the dragons ever leave the forest.\"  But he complied, and pointed out the broken bolt on the inner side.  \"I thought I heard something snap when I shoved against it. That bolt's freshly broken. Rust has eaten nearly through it. If the people ran away, why should it have been bolted on the inside?\"  \"They undoubtedly left by another door,\" suggested Valeria.  She wondered how many centuries had passed since the light of outer day had filtered into that great hall through the open door. Sunlight was finding its way somehow into the hall, and they quickly saw the source. High up in the vaulted ceiling skylights were set in slot-like openings--translucent sheets of some crystalline substance. In the splotches of shadow between them, the green jewels winked like the eyes of angry cats. Beneath their feet the dully lurid floor smoldered with changing hues and colors of flame. It was like treading the floors of hell with evil stars blinking overhead.  Three balustraded galleries ran along on each side of the hall, one above the other.  \"A four-storied house,\" grunted Conan, \"and this hall extends to the roof. It's long as a street. I seem to see a door at the other end.\"  Valeria shrugged her white shoulders.  \"Your eyes are better than mine, then, though I'm accounted sharp-eyed among the sea-rovers.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They turned into an open door at random, and traversed a series of empty chambers, floored like the hall, and with walls of the same green jade, or of marble or ivory or chalcedony, adorned with friezes of bronze, gold or silver. In the ceilings the green fire-gems were set, and their light was as ghostly and illusive as Conan had predicted. Under the witch-fire glow the intruders moved like specters.  Some of the chambers lacked this illumination, and their doorways showed black as the mouth of the Pit. These Conan and Valeria avoided, keeping always to the lighted chambers.  Cobwebs hung in the corners, but there was no perceptible accumulation of dust on the floor, or on the tables and seats of marble, jade or carnelian which occupied the chambers. Here and there were rugs of that silk known as Khitan which is practically indestructible. Nowhere did they find any windows, or doors opening into streets or courts. Each door merely opened into another chamber or hall.  \"Why don't we come to a street?\" grumbled Valeria. \"This place or whatever we're in must be as big as the king of Turan's seraglio.\"  \"They must not have perished of plague,\" said Conan, meditating upon the mystery of the empty city. \"Otherwise we'd find skeletons. Maybe it became haunted, and everybody got up and left. Maybe----\"  \"Maybe, hell!\" broke in Valeria rudely. \"We'll never know. Look at these friezes. They portray men. What race do they belong to?\"  Conan scanned them and shook his head.  \"I never saw people exactly like them. But there's the smack of the East about them--Vendhya, maybe, or Kosala.\"  \"Were you a king in Kosala?\" she asked, masking her keen curiosity with derision.  \"No. But I was a war-chief of the Afghulis"]]]
