In days of unclouded prosperity other gods called forth our devotion and enthusiasm, but the God of our Fathers who made us a great nation and sent us to sow the seeds of righteousness beside all waters, bestowing upon us empire and might, was well-nigh forgotten.  For the new man \"words like Empire, Patriotism, Duty, Honour, Glory and God\" had little or no meaning.  Causes for which the fathers died could not evoke an added heart-beat from their sons.  They cared so little for the mighty empire which they inherited that they contemplated the bloodshed of civil war--so hot was their zeal for party and so cold their love for the state.  It was necessary that discipline should come.  And that discipline came, shaking the very foundations of our national life.  Its first fruit is that the smouldering fires of patriotism have broken forth once more into bright flame; and that everywhere the hearts of the people have been stirred by the call to arise and endure hardness that the goodly heritage of empire perish not.  And preachers in a thousand pulpits have sounded the trumpet-note of duty and of patriotism.  ***  It has been said that preachers should aim at making the churches sanctuaries of peace, within whose walls the echoes of the guns and the cries of the perishing should not penetrate.  Some have even said that Christianity, so far from fostering the spirit of patriotism, is in reality hostile to it.  \"Patriotism itself as a duty,\" says Lecky, \"has never found any place in Christian ethics, and strong theological feeling has usually been directly hostile to its growth.\"  No doubt there is something to be said for that view.  The attitude of the early Christians towards the Roman Empire was not that of patriotism.  The clear shining of the heavenly Jerusalem so dazzled their eyes that this world, and the temporal empire occupying its stage, seemed but as a shadow.  Their devotion to the Unseen King left little room for loyalty to the earthly ruler.  In the glorious consciousness of his citizenship in heaven, it was a small thing in the estimation of St. Paul that he was also a Roman citizen--but he did not forget it.  But when the earthly ruler persecuted, and burnt, and threw the Christians to the lions, or slaughtered them to make a Roman holiday, then the poor victims cannot be blamed for not being patriots.  And the Church in the mediæval period, organised in the mighty hierarchy of Rome, did not tend to foster a national spirit of patriotism.  In those days when the Emperor Theodosius made penance in the Cathedral of Milan and Ambrose declared that \"the Church is not in the empire, but the Emperor in the Church\"; or in those later days when Hildebrand promulgated the doctrine that the temporal power was subject to the spiritual power, and kings and emperors were only vassals of the Church, and Henry V. was left three days standing barefooted in the snow waiting humbly to see the Pope at Canossa--in those days certainly Christianity sought to foster not the sense of national loyalty, but that of devotion towards that holy Catholic and universal Church whose visible head was the Pope.  Christianity placed the Pope on the throne of the Cæsars, and sought to evoke towards him a patriotism which transcended nationality.  But the Reformation gave its death blow to Hildebrandism, and the Pope no longer usurped the temporal Thrones of Europe.  And there came the throb of the awakening spirit of nationality.  The spirit of patriotism stirred once more the slumbering races.  ***  The question whether patriotism is a fruit of Christianity must be answered not by reference to what men did in the name of their religion--for men are fallible--but by the precept and example of the Founder of Christianity.  He was a Jew, and of all races the Jew was the most patriotic.  An exile by the rivers of Babylon, the Israelite refused to forget Zion.  \"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its cunning\"--that was the cry wherewith his unconquerable soul faced an overwhelming destiny.  And in this respect Jesus Christ was true to His race.  He was a patriot.  He worshipped in the synagogues, and went on pilgrimages to Jerusalem, because He loved the national institutions of His country.  One note of true patriotism is anguish.  It is when love is great that the folly and sin of the person beloved pierce the heart.  The patriotism of the Founder of Christianity expressed itself in a cry of agony which has reverberated through the centuries--\"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.\"  That cry is the measure of His patriotism.  Judged, then, by the example of its Founder, Christianity must produce the spirit of love and loyalty towards one's own country.  There was a patriotism before Christianity, but it was that of arrogance, aggression, and self-glorification.  It was a patriotism which meted out only contempt to other races.  To the Jew the Greek was only a Gentile dog; to the Greek the Jew was only a contemptible Barbarian.  But the patriotism which is animated by the Christian spirit is far other.  It is not the vaunting of pride nor the shouting of vulgar ditties.  It seeks the glory of its own country, but the glory it seeks is the glory of the greater service rendered to humanity.  Conscious of its own defects, it does not condemn others.  With eyes cleansed from prejudice, it beholds the good in other races.  It seeks the first place for its own nation because it acts the noblest, loves the best. All the elements which make up the strong power of patriotism--love of family, love of neighbours, love of race, love of country--Christianity has purified them all.  True patriotism is, then, a fruit of the Christian religion, a virtue which falls to be inculcated by the Church.  If Christianity be the projection of the Christ-life into the midst of every generation, then the life that reflects the beauty of Christ must be a life animated by the deepest love of one's country.  ***  It was Dean Stanley who rendered God thanks in Paisley Abbey for that Scotsmen were \"citizens of an Empire so great, members of a Church so free.\"  In the building up of the Empire Scotsmen have borne a great share of toil and peril.  In other days the fires of patriotism burned brightly.  The cry of our fathers was \"my country right or wrong.\"  But we feel not quite so sure of our country being always in the right. The passion of Christianity is an ethical passion.  Christian patriotism demands national righteousness.  To keep patriotism as an ardent fire we must be convinced that our country stands for righteousness.  And in this day of our ordeal we have this certainty to uphold us, that we are fighting for the right.  It was not in defiance of Christianity, but in its defence, that we drew the sword.  For this war sprang from an unbridled lust of conquest to which a whole nation surrendered itself.  But before surrendering to the passions of war the ideals of Christ were first forsaken by our enemy.  A new law was promulgated: \"Become hard, O my brethren, for we are emancipated and the world belongs to us.\"  New beatitudes were declared: \"Ye have heard how ... it was said, Blessed are the meek ... but I say unto you, Blessed are the valiant, for they shall make the earth their throne ... Ye have read, Blessed are the peacemakers, but I say unto you, Blessed are the war-makers, for they shall be called, if not the children of Jehovah, the children of Odin, who is greater than Jehovah.\"  Out of this new gospel, the gospel of Odin, has sprung a war of extermination--exiled nations, devastated kingdoms, desolated colleges, ruined cathedrals, and multitudes of women and children \"left nothing but their eyes to weep with.\"  The name of God has been invoked over unspeakable barbarities--but the God thus invoked is not the Christian God.  It is Odin in whose name these things are done.  What we are fighting for is for the Christian ideal against Odin--for the law of truth and mercy against the reign of falsehood of word and bond, and of merciless barbarity.  We have bared the breast to death that there may sit on the throne of the world's soul, not a ruthless tribal god, but the God of Fatherhood and Love whom Jesus Christ revealed.  And in waging that war we have ground to hope that the God of righteousness is on our side.  If we have not had the name of God constantly on our lips it is not because we do not feel that we are fighting His battle, but because He is so great, the Lord of Heaven and Earth before whom we are but as dust, that we shrink from coupling His great name with ours.  \"Are you sure that God is on your side?\" Abraham Lincoln was asked in the dark days of the American Civil War.  \"I have not thought about that,\" he replied; \"but I am very anxious to know whether we are on God's side.\" And when the causes of this war are examined the assurance grows stronger and stronger that we are on God's side.  That is why the whole nation has been welded into the unity and consistency of polished steel; why the fire of patriotism burns in our midst with an intenser heat than ever before.  ***  It is not merely from the righteousness of our cause in this war that our patriotism draws inspiration, but also from the ideals for which our Empire stands over all the world.  As we look out to-day on the Empire which our fathers bequeathed us, taking it all in all, it stands for righteousness as no other on earth.  It stands for the freedom of the soul and the freedom of the body all over the world.  Think of India, whose three hundred millions have been rescued from tyranny and ceaseless bloodshed, whose widows have been saved from the flames, whose starving have been "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33635"],["title","The Great Discovery (#3)"],["body","in famine, and to whom the British race brought security and peace.  \"When I think,\" said ex-President Taft, \"of what England has done in India ... how she found those many millions torn by internecine strife, disrupted with constant wars, unable to continue agriculture or the arts of peace, with inferior roads, tyranny, and oppression; and when I think what the Government of Great Britain is now doing for these alien races, the debt the world owes England ought to be acknowledged in no grudging manner.\"  No work ever done on earth for the elevation of humanity can compare with that wrought in India by our race for the uplift of humanity; and it is the same wherever the standard of Britain waves.  In our own day we have seen in Egypt a whole race rising out of the mud and clothed anew in the garments of self-respect.  Through Africa, wherever the sway of Britain extends, though yesterday the land reeked with blood, to-day mercy and kindness are healing the woes of men, and millions who knew not when death lurked for them in the bush now sleep in peace under the palms.  It was the might of Britain that destroyed the slave trade, and it is nothing except the might of Britain which prevents the slave raider resuming his nefarious traffic, and slavery under the guise of other names being imposed on the natives of Africa.  Wherever you go, to the tropics or the Orient, there the great power for righteousness is the British Empire.  It does not exploit inferior races for gold; it is the trustee of the helpless native.  When one thinks of these little islands floating in the western sea, of the power that has gone forth from them to heal and bless, of the vast multitudes to whom the King-Emperor is the symbol of justice and security--his is a poor heart which cannot feel the thrill of gratitude for citizenship in an Empire girdling the whole earth, whose foundations are thus laid in righteousness.  ***  Patriotism is not, however, a mere sentiment.  It was not sentiment which built up the Empire.  It was self-sacrifice--the spirit that faced and endured death.  For us, too, patriotism must be more than sentiment; it must be action and the self-sacrifice which action requires.  What our fathers reared we must defend.  And the startling thing is that there are still so many of our people who shrink from the burden which patriotism imposes.  Many thousands refuse to prepare themselves for war; who are as the Romans who could not leave their baths to go and fight.  Vast multitudes congregate to gaze on football matches and gamble on the issue.  The call of King and country falls on ears grown deaf.  We thank God for those who, hearing the call, have gone forth to fight, counting everything but loss as compared to their country's gain.  But these others, they cannot have paused to think.  They have not pictured these fair lands, that have not heard the sound of war for seven generations, given over to that devouring enemy which has made Belgium a wilderness.  They have not thought of Oxford and St. Andrews sharing the fate of Louvain; of London and Edinburgh become as Brussels; of the millions of Glasgow and Birmingham thrown on the mercies of the world, women and children fleeing, driven by nameless fears, with no place to flee to but the mountain fastnesses of Wales and the Highlands of Scotland--the last refuge of the miserable and the broken.  And yet these miseries would surely befall were all the manhood of the race such as these.  Think what it would mean were the walls of our defence broken down. Supposing that a shattering blow were struck at the heart of the Empire and our fleet crushed.  What would follow?  The crumbling of the Empire in a week!  It is not we alone, with our wives and children in these little islands, who would be swept to ruin, and on whom despair would fall.  From the far north-west to the long wash of the Australasian seas the shadow of devouring misery and death would fall on humanity. The millions of India would be forthwith swept into the whirlpools of war and mutiny.  Egypt would be thrown back into chaos.  Africa would be left to Islam and the merciless rule of a nation which knows but how to smite.  Australia and New Zealand would be at the mercy of the yellow races.  It would not be a calamity for us in these islands alone.  It would be a calamity whose withering blight would be cast over all the world. The ideals of righteousness which this Empire upholds would be trampled everywhere under foot.  Covetousness and the lust of gold would hold the field of the world.  There is only one thing to be done, one duty summoning us with an irresistible call--the duty that calls us to stand between our country and destruction.  Were the fate which has overtaken the Low Country to overtake us; were this fair land to be made a wilderness, our women and children driven into the wilds, and the Empire wrested from our hands, the men who failed in their duty would never be able to hold up their heads again.  What a terrible load would lie on him who, beholding the ruin of his native land, could say, \"This might not have happened if I, and others like me, had done our duty.\"  That would be a hell from which there would be no escape.  \"Which way I fly is hell; myself am hell.\"  There can be no limit to the sacrifice which patriotism requires, so great a heritage is our native land.  It does not require of us as Christians to engage in wars of conquest for the gratification of pride and greed, but it does require of us even the sacrifice of our lives in the defence of our homes or in the defence of our brother's home.  There are those who find themselves faced with difficulty.  They are called upon to fight with every force in their power, to slay, withholding not their hand, while they hear the commandment, \"Thou shall not kill,\" ringing in their ears, and across the centuries the voice of their Lord saying, \"Resist not evil; whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\"  They are bewildered.  Is not the attitude of non-resistance that which Jesus Christ enjoins?  If they fight with sword and shell are they not lowering themselves to the level of Nietzsche, Bernhardi and Bülow, and submitting to the arbitrament of the sword, which decides nothing except its own sharpness.  The call of patriotism summoning to resist even unto blood comes to them, and they are uncertain whether to obey.  But we must interpret the will of God, not by isolated sentences, but by the whole content of the divine revelation.  The commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" does not mean that we are not to kill in any circumstance whatever.  If the commandment is to be taken literally, then no limit is to be set to it, and we must not kill any animal--not even the parasites of uncleanness.  There is, moreover, another law which runs: \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God created He him.\"  So far from the mere physical life being for ever sacred, the very altar of God Himself was to be no sanctuary for the murderer.  The man who owned a vicious ox and knew him to be vicious, and the ox killed a man, the owner thereof was to be slain.  There are therefore circumstances in which the law, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" is abrogated, and its place is taken by the law, \"Thou shalt kill.\"  The law demanding the conservation of life rests on this foundation, not that physical life itself is sacred, but that human life bears the image of God.  There are things far more sacred than the physical life--even those things which constitute the image of God stamped upon man.  There are things for which men in all ages have been content to die--truth and loyalty to truth, the principles which are dearer than life.  Those things which God ordained that men might through them grow more and more into His image, for these things man must be ready to die, and among these things is nationality.  Men cannot develop in isolation.  What poor creatures men would be if they were solitary units.  They would be as the beasts that perish.  It is through the heritage of nationality that the soul is enriched.  What poor stunted lives would ours be if we had not behind us the great and noble deeds which built up our Empire, if the words of the high souls of many generations did not come thrilling to our hearts, if Shakespeare and Wordsworth, Scott and Burns did not pour their treasures into our laps.  The soul grows into the image of God through the riches of nationality.  And whosoever warreth against nationality warreth against the soul.  And the men who warreth against the soul must be resisted to the death.  ***  We dare not appeal to Jesus Christ to cloak our shrinking from sacrifice.  No doubt His gentleness has been the wonder of history; but His strength also summons us to be strong.  For Jesus Christ was not a quietist.  His religion is not a mere hospital for wounded souls.  His place is among the strong of the earth.  He faced the evil of this earth unflinching in His resistance.  \"Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites\" is His denunciation of the oppressor; \"Go tell that fox\" is His message to the tyrant.  When we think of Him making the whips, and falling, with holy anger in His eyes, on those who desecrated the courts of the temple, overturning the tables of the money changers, we know that the ideal of non-resistance is not His.  No doubt He laid it down as the law for the individual that he should turn the other cheek; but He did not lay it down as a law that a man should turn another's cheek to the smiter.  What the individual can do, the nation may not do.  It no doubt is the duty of the Ruler to turn his own individual cheek to the insulter; it is not his duty to turn the cheeks of the millions over whom he rules to those who would smite them, committing their children to shame and their homes to devastation.  No doubt Jesus Christ enjoined the law of forgiveness, but"]]]
