Certain answers to questions may not be given in the presence of an Earthwoman.\"  Fred whistled. \"The Ollies have mastered more than our language ... I thought you said they were noted mainly for their linguistic talents, Cliff.\"  I was surprised, too. In the space of a few hectic months our alien visitors had probed deeply into our culture, mores and taboos--and then had had the genius to instill their compounded discretions into their Soths.  I said, \"Satisfied, Vicki?\"  She was still arranging herself. Her lips curled up at the corners impishly. \"I'm almost disappointed,\" she said. \"I do an all-out striptease, and no one looks but my husband. Of course,\" she added thoughtfully, \"I suppose that's something....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Fred stayed with us until Sunday evening. I went down to the pier to smoke a good-night pipe with him, and get his private opinion.  \"I'm buying a hundred shares of Worldwide stock tomorrow,\" he declared. \"That critter is worth his weight in diamonds to every well-heeled housewife in the country. In fact, put me down for one of your first models. I wouldn't mind having a laundry sorter and morning coffee-pourer, myself.\"  \"Think he's safe, do you?\"  \"No more emotions than that stump over there. And it baffles me. He has self-awareness, pain-sensitivity and a fantastic vocabulary, yet I needled him all afternoon with every semantic hypo I could think of without getting a flicker of emotion out of him.\" He paused. \"Incidentally, I made him strip for me in my room. You'll be as confused as I was to learn that he's every inch a man in his format.\"  \"What?\" I exclaimed.  \"Made me wonder what his duties included back on his home planet ... but as I said, no emotions. With the set of built-in inhibitions he has, he'd beat a eunuch out of his job any day of the week.\"  A few seconds later, Fred dropped into his little two-seater and skimmed off for home, leaving me with a rather disturbing question in my mind.  I went back to the house and cornered Soth out in the kitchen alone. Vicki had him polishing all the antique silverware.  \"Are there female Soths?\" I asked point-blank.  He looked down at me with that relaxed, pink look and said, \"No, Mr. Collins,\" and went back to his polishing.  The damned liar. He knew what I meant. He justified himself on a technicality.         *       *       *       *       *  I left Vicki Monday morning with more confidence than I'd had in ages. She had slept especially well, and the only thing on her mind was Clumsy's disappearance. He hadn't shown up since Soth scared the fleas off him with that hiss.  At the office, I had my girl transcribe my notes and work up a memorandum to the board of directors. We sent it around before noon, and shortly after lunch I had calls from all ten of them, including the chairman. It was not that they considered it such a big thing--they were just plainly curious. We scheduled a meeting for Tuesday morning, to talk the thing over.  That night when I got home, all was serene. Soth served us cocktails, dinner and a late snack, and had the place tidied up by bedtime. He did all this and managed to remain virtually invisible. He moved so quietly and with such uncanny anticipation of our demands, it was if he were an old family retainer, long versed in our habits and customs.  Vicki bragged as she undressed that she had the giant hog-tied and jumping through hoops.  \"We even got half the excavation done for the rock wall,\" she said proudly.  On impulse, I went out into the hall and down to Soth's room, where I found him stretched out slaunchwise across the double bed.  He opened his eyes as I came in, but didn't stir.  \"Are you happy here?\" I asked bluntly.  He sat up and did something new. He answered my question with a question. \"Are you happy with my services?\"  I said, \"Yes, of course.\"  \"Then all is well,\" he replied simply, and lay down again.  It seemed like a satisfactory answer. He radiated a feeling of peace, and the expression of repose on his heavy features was assuring.         *       *       *       *       *  It rained hard and cold during the night. I hadn't shown Soth how to start the automatic heating unit. When I left the house next morning, he was bringing Vicki her breakfast in bed, a tray on one arm and a handful of kindling under the other. Only once had he watched me build a fire in the fireplace, but he proceeded with confidence.  We flew blind through filthy weather all the way to Detroit. I dismissed Jack with orders to return at eleven with Soth.  \"Don't be late,\" I warned him.  Jack looked a little uneasy, but he showed up on schedule and delivered Soth to us with rain droplets on his massive bald pate, just ten minutes after the conference convened.  I had Ollie Johnson there, too, to put Soth through his paces. The Ollie, in a bedraggled, soggy suit, was so excited that he remained an almost purplish black for the whole hour.  The directors were charmed, impressed and enthusiastic.  When I finished my personal report on the Soth's tremendous success in my own household, old Gulbrandson, Chairman of the Board, shined his rosy cheeks with his handkerchief and said, \"I'll take the first three you produce, Johnson. Our staff of domestics costs me more than a brace of attorneys, and it turns over about three times a year. Cook can't even set the timer on the egg-cooker right.\" He turned to me. \"Sure he can make good coffee, Collins?\"  I nodded emphatically.  \"Then put me down for three for sure,\" he said with executive finality.  Gulbrandson paid dearly for his piggishness later, but at the time it seemed only natural that if one Soth could run a household efficiently, then the Chairman of the Board should have at least two spares in case one blew a fuse or a vesicle or whatever it was they might blow.         *       *       *       *       *  A small, dignified riot almost broke up the meeting right there, and when they quieted down again I had orders for twenty-six Soths from the board members and one from my own secretary.  \"How soon,\" I asked Ollie Johnson, \"can you begin deliveries?\"  He dry-washed his hands and admitted it would be five months, and a sigh of disappointment ran around the table. Then someone asked him how many units a month they could turn out.  He stared at the carpet and held out his hands like a pawn-broker disparaging a diamond ring: \"Our techniques are so slow. The first month, maybe a hundred. Of course, once our cultures are all producing in harmony, almost any number. One thousand? Ten thousand? Whatever your needs suggest.\"  One of the officers asked, \"Is your process entirely biological? You mentioned cultures.\"  For a moment, I thought Ollie Johnson was going to break out in tears. His face twisted.  \"Abysmally so,\" he grieved. \"Our synthetic models have never proved durable. Upkeep and parts replacements are prohibitive. Our brain units are much similar to your own latest developments in positronics, but we have had to resort to organic cellular structure in order to achieve the mobility which Mr. Collins admired last Friday.\"  The upshot of the meeting was a hearty endorsement over my signature on the Ollies' contract, plus an offer of any help they might need to get production rolling.  As the meeting broke up, they pumped my hand and stared enviously at my Soth. Several offered me large sums for him, up to fifteen thousand dollars, and for the moment I sweated out the rack of owning something my bosses did not. Their understandable resentment, however, was tempered by their recognition of my genius in getting a signed contract before the Ollies went shopping to our competitors.  What none of us understood right then was that the Ollies were hiring us, not the other way around.  When I told Vicki about my hour of triumph and how the officers bid up our Soth, she glowed with the very feminine delight of exclusive possession. She hugged me and gloated, \"Old biddy Gulbrandson--won't she writhe? And don't you dare take _any_ offer for our Soth. He's one of the family now, eh, Soth, old boy?\"  He was serving soup to her as she slapped him on the hip. Somehow he managed to retreat so fast she almost missed him, yet he didn't spill a drop of bouillon from the poised tureen.  \"Yes, Mrs. Collins,\" he said, not a trace more nor less aloof than usual.  \"Oops, sorry!\" Vicki apologized. \"I forgot. The code.\"  I had the feeling that warm-hearted Vicki would have had the Soth down on the bearskin rug in front of the big fireplace, scuffling him like she did Clumsy, if it hadn't been for the Soth's untouchable code--and I was thankful that it existed. Vicki had a way of putting her hand on you when she spoke, or hugging anyone in sight when she was especially delighted.  And I knew something about Soth that she didn't. Something that apparently hadn't bothered her mind since the day of her striptease.         *       *       *       *       *  Summer was gone and it was mid-fall before Ollie paid me another visit. When he showed up again, it was with an invoice for 86 Soths, listed by serial numbers and ready to ship. He had heard about sight drafts and wanted me to help him prepare one.  \"To hell with that noise,\" I told him. I wrote a note to purchasing and countersigned the Ollie's invoice for some $103,000. I called my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32828"],["title","Backlash (#3)"],["body","and told her to take Ollie and his bill down to disbursing and have him paid off.  I had to duck behind my desk before the Ollie dreamed up some new obscenity of gratitude to heap on me. Then I cleared shipping instructions through sales for the Soths already on order and dictated a memo to our promotion department. I cautioned them to go slowly at first--the Soths would be on tight allotment for a while.  One snarl developed. The Department of Internal Revenue landed on us with the question: Were the Soths manufactured or grown? We beat them out of a manufacturer's excise tax, but it cost us plenty in legal fees.  The heads of three labor unions called on me the same afternoon of the tax hearing. They got their assurances in the form of a clause in the individual purchase contracts, to the effect that the \"consumer\" agreed not to employ a Soth for the purpose of evading labor costs in the arts, trades and professions as organized under the various unions, and at all times to be prepared to withdraw said Soth from any unlisted job in which the unions might choose to place a member human worker.  Before they left, all three union men placed orders for household Soths.  \"Hell,\" said one, \"that's less than the cost of a new car. Now maybe my wife will get off my back on this damfool business of organizing a maid's and butler's union. Takes members to run a union, and the only real butler in our neighborhood makes more than I do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That's the way it went. The only reason we spent a nickel on advertising was to brag up the name of W. W. M. and wave our coup in the faces of our competitors. By Christmas, production was up to two thousand units a month, and we were already six thousand orders behind.  The following June, the Ollies moved into a good hunk of the old abandoned Willow Run plant and got their production up to ten thousand a month. Only then could we begin to think of sending out floor samples of Soths to our distributors.  It was fall before the distributors could place samples with the most exclusive of their retail accounts. The interim was spent simply relaying frantic priority orders from high-ranking people all over the globe directly to the plant, where the Ollies filled them right out of the vats.  Twenty thousand a month was their limit, it turned out. Even when they had human crews completely trained in all production phases, the fifty-six Ollies could handle only that many units in their secret conditioning and training laboratories.  For over two more years, business went on swimmingly. I got a fancy bonus and a nice vacation in Paris, where I was the rage of the continent. I was plagued with requests for speaking engagements, which invariably turned out to be before select parties of V. I. P.s whose purpose was to twist my arm for an early priority on a Soth delivery.  When I returned home, it was just in time to have the first stink land in my lap.  An old maid claimed her Soth had raped her.  Before our investigators could reveal our doctors' findings that she was a neurotic, dried up old virgin and lying in her teeth, a real crime occurred.  A New Jersey Soth tossed a psychology instructor and his three students out of a third floor window of their university science building, and all four ended an attempted morbid investigation on the broad, unyielding cement of the concourse.  My phone shrieked while they were still scraping the inquiring minds off the pavement. The Soth was holed up in the lab, and would I come right away?         *       *       *       *       *  I picked up Ollie Johnson, who was now sort of a public relations man for his tribe, and we arrived within an hour.  The hallway was full of uniforms and weapons, but quite empty of volunteers to go in and capture the \"berserk\" robot.  Ollie and I went in right away, and found him standing at the open window, staring down at the people with hoses washing off the stains for which he was responsible.  Ollie just stood there, clenching and unclenching his hands and shaking hysterically. I had to do the questioning.  I said sternly, \"Soth, why did you harm those people?\"  He turned to me as calmly as my own servant. His neat denim jacket, now standard fatigue uniform for Soths, was unfastened. His muscular chest was bare.  \"They were tormenting me with that.\" He pointed to a small electric generator from which ran thin cables ending in sharp test prods. \"I told Professor Kahnovsky it was not allowed, but he stated I was his property. The three boys tried to hold me with those straps while the professor touched me with the prods.  \"My conditioning forbade me from harming them, but there was a clear violation of the terms of the covenant. I was in the proscribed condition of immobility when the generator was started. When the pain grew unbearable, the prime command of my conditioning was invoked. I must survive. I threw them all out the window.\"  The Soth went with us peacefully enough, and submitted to the lockup without demur. For a few days, before the state thought up a suitable indictment, the papers held a stunned silence. Virtually every editor and publisher had a Soth in his own home.  Then the D.A., who also owned a Soth, decided to drop the potentially sensational first degree murder charges that might be indicated, and came out instead with a second degree indictment.         *       *       *       *       *  That cracked it. The press split down the middle on whether the charge should be changed to third degree murder or thrown out of court entirely as justifiable homicide by a non-responsible creature.  This was all very sympathetic to the Soth's cause, but it had a fatal effect. In bringing out the details of the crime, it stirred a certain lower element of our society to add fear and hate to a simmering envy of the wealthier Soth-owners.  Mobs formed in the streets, marching and demonstrating. The phony rape story was given full credence, and soon they were amplifying it to a lurid and rabble-rousing saga of bestiality.  Soth households kept their prized servants safely inside. But on the afternoon of the case's dismissal, when the freed Soth started down the courthouse steps, someone caved his head in with a brick.  Ollie Johnson and I were on either side of him, and his purple blood splashed all over my light topcoat. When the mob saw it, they closed in on us screaming for more.  An officer helped us drag the stricken Soth back into the courthouse, and while the riot squad disbursed the mob, we slipped him out the back way in an ambulance, which returned him to the Willow Run plant for repairs.  It hit the evening newscasts and editions:      ACQUITTED SOTH        MURDERED  ON COURTHOUSE STEPS!         *       *       *       *       *  I was halfway home when the airwaves started buzzing. The mobs were going wild. Further developments were described as Jack and I landed on the wind-blown lake. The State Guard was protecting the Ollies' Willow Run Plant against a large mob that was trying to storm it, and reinforcements had been asked by the state police.  Vicki met me on the pier. Her face was white and terribly troubled. I guess mine was, too, because she burst into tears in my arms. \"The poor Soth,\" she sobbed. \"Now what will they do?\"  \"God knows,\" I said. I told Jack to tie up the boat and stay overnight--I feared I might be called back any minute. He mumbled something about overtime, but I think his main concern was in staying so near to a Soth during the trouble that was brewing.  We went up to the house, leaving him to bed himself down in the temporary quarters in the boathouse that the union required I maintain for him.  Soth was standing motionless before the video, staring at a streaky picture of the riot scene at Willow Run. His face was inscrutable as usual, but I thought I sensed a tension. His black serving-jacket was wrinkled at the shoulders as he flexed the muscles of his powerful arms.  Yet when Vicki asked for some martinis, he mixed and served them without comment. We drank and then ate dinner in silence. We were both reluctant to discuss this thing in front of Soth.  We were still eating when an aircab thundered overhead. A minute later, I watched it land a tiny passenger at our pier and tie up to wait for him.  It was Ollie Johnson, stumbling hatless up the flagstone path.  I held the door for him, but he burst by me with hardly a glance.  \"Where is he?\" he demanded, and stormed out into the kitchen without awaiting a reply.  I followed in time to see him fall on his face before our Soth and shed genuine tears. He lay there sobbing and hissing for over a minute, and an incredible idea began forming in my mind. I sent Vicki to her bedroom and stepped into the kitchen.  I said, \"Will you please explain this?\"  He didn't move or acknowledge.  Soth flipped him aside with a twist of his ankle and brushed past me into the living room, where he took up an immobile stance again before the video. He stared unblinkingly at the 40-inch screen.  \"It's too bad,\" I said.  He didn't answer, but he moved his head slightly so that his parabolic ear could catch the sound of my movements.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration]  For minutes we stood transfixed by the magnitude of the mob action around the entrance to the Willow Run plant. The portable video transmitter was atop a truck parked on the outskirts of the mob. Thousands of people were milling around, and over the excited voice of the announcer came hysterical screams.  Even as we watched, more people thronged into the scene, and it was evident that the flimsy cordon of soldiers and troopers could not hold the line for long.  Army trucks with million-candlepower searchlights held the insane figures somewhat at bay by tilting their hot, blinding beams down into the human masses and threatening them with tear gas and hack guns.  The workers were out for blood. Not content with"]]]
