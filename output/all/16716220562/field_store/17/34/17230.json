Time after time he was on the point of venturing some comment, checking himself only with obvious effort.  He soon discovered, however, that if he were to make no noise he must devote his entire attention to his work.  \"Mustn't drop a bloomin' brush, or fall over a bloomin' paint-pot,\" he grumbled, \"but wot yer gets the sack.  Rummy 'ole, this.\"  Once his brush slipped from his hand, but by a masterly contortion he recovered it before it reached the ground.  The foreman, who happened to be passing at the time, eyed him steadily for several seconds, then with withering scorn remarked in a hoarse whisper as he turned on his heel:  \"Paintin's your job, slippery, not jugglin'.\"  Not to be able to retort and wither an opponent was to Bindle a new experience; but to remain silent in the face of an insult from a foreman was an intolerable humiliation.  To Bindle foremen were the epitome of evil.  He had once in a moment of supreme contempt remarked to his brother-in-law:  \"Call yerself a man, 'Oly Moses!  I've seen better things than you in bloomin' foremen's jobs!\"  Mr. Hearty had not appreciated the withering contempt that underlay this remark, being too much aghast at its profanity.  Bindle had said to his wife:  \"You and 'Earty is always so busy lookin' for sin that you ain't time to see a joke.\"  Bindle quickly tired of the work, and after a few days allowed it to transpire, as if quite casually, that he was a man of many crafts.  He gave his mates to understand, for instance, that he was a carpenter of such transcendental ability as to be entirely wasted as a painter.  He threw out the hint in the hope that it might reach the ears of the foreman and result in an occasional change of work.  He was inexpressibly weary of this silent painting.  The world had changed for him.  \"Sleepin' all the sunny day,\" he grumbled, \"and dabbin' on paint all the bloomin' night; not allowed to blow yer nose, an' me not knowin' the deaf-and-dumb alphabet.\"  He would probably have been more content had it not been for the foreman.  He had known many foremen in his time, but this man carried offensiveness to the point of inspiration.  He had been at his present work for many years, and was consequently well versed in the arts of conveying insult other than by word of mouth.  He was possessed of many gestures so expressive in their power of humiliating contempt, that upon Bindle their effect was the same as if he had been struck in the face.  One of these Bindle gathered he had learned from a sailor, who had assured him that in Brazil the inevitable response was the knife.  Ever after, Bindle had a great respect for the Brazilian, and the laws of a country that permitted the arbitrary punishment of silent insult.  Henceforward the foreman became the centre of Bindle's thoughts.  Too genial and happy-go-lucky by nature himself to nourish any enmity against his superior, Bindle was determined to teach him a lesson, should the chance occur.  The man was a bully, and Bindle disliked bullies.  At last his chance came, much to Bindle's satisfaction, as a result of his own foresight in allowing it to become known that he possessed some ability as a carpenter.  The third floor corridor, known as No. 1 East, was to be redecorated. In painting the doors all the numbers, which were separate figures of gun-metal, had to be removed before the painting was commenced and replaced after it was completed.  This required great care, not only that the guests might not be awakened, but that the partially dried paint might not be smeared.  The foreman always performed this delicate operation himself, regarding it as of too great importance to entrust to a subordinate.  On this particular occasion, however, the foreman had received an invitation to a beanfeast at Epping.  This was for the Saturday, and the corridor was to be redecorated on the Friday night.  As an early start was to be made, the foreman was anxious to get away and obtain some sleep that he might enjoy the day to its full extent.  He had done all he could to postpone the work until the next week, but without success, so it became necessary for him either to find a substitute, or go weary-eyed and sleepless to his pleasure.  For a man of the social temperament of the foreman to decline such an invitation was unthinkable.  Just as he had arrived at the conclusion that he would have to go straight from work, his eye lighted on Bindle, and remembering what he had heard about his varied abilities, he beckoned him to follow to a room that temporarily served as an Office of Works.  Inside the room Bindle gazed expectantly at his superior.  \"I 'ear you've been a carpenter,\" the foreman began.  \"Funny 'ow rumours do get about,\" remarked Bindle pleasantly.  \"I remember when my brother-in-law, 'Earty's 'is name--ever met him? Quaint ole bird, 'Earty.--Well, when 'e----\"  \"Never mind 'im,\" returned the foreman, \"can you 'andle a screw-driver?\"  \"'Andle any think except a woman.  Married yerself?\" Bindle interrogated with significance.  Ignoring the question the foreman continued: \"Can you take the numbers off them rosy doors in the east corridor, and put 'em back again to-night without makin' a stutterin' row?\"  \"Me?\" queried Bindle in surprise.  \"I got to go to a funeral,\" continued the foreman, avoiding Bindle's eye, \"an' I want to get a bit o' sleep first.\"  Bindle eyed his superior curiously.  \"Funny things, funerals,\" he remarked casually.  \"Goin' to 'ave a cornet on the 'earse?\"  \"A what?\"  \"The last time I went to a funeral the guv'nor saw me on the box, next to Ole 'Arper, and all the boys a-shoutin' somethink about 'Ope and Glory.  The ole guv'nor didn't ought to 'ave been out so early.  Ole 'Arper could play; 'e'd wake a 'ole village while another man was thinkin' about it,\" he added reminiscently.  \"It's my mother wot's dead,\" said the foreman dully, unequal to the task of stemming the tide of Bindle's loquacity and at the same time keeping on good terms with him.  \"Yer mother?  I'm sorry.  Buryin' 'is mother twice got 'Oly Jim into an 'orrible mess.  He fixed 'er funeral for February--all serene; but wot must he go an' do, the silly 'Uggins, but forget all about it and start a-buryin' of 'er again in June.  'Is guv'nor used to keep a book o' buryin's, and it took Jim quite a long time to explain that 'is buryin' of 'er twice all come about through 'im bein' a twin.\"  The foreman's impatience was visibly growing.  \"Never you mind about Jim, 'oly or otherwise.  Can yer take off and put on again them numbers?\"  Then after a pause he added casually, nodding in the direction of a cupboard in the corner:  \"There's a couple of bottles o' beer and some bread an' cheese an' pickles in that cupboard.\"  Bindle's face brightened, and thus it was that the bargain was struck.  When Bindle left the room it was with the knowledge that his superior had been delivered into his hands.  He did not then know exactly how he intended to compass the foreman's downfall.  Inspiration would come later.  It was sufficient for him to know that correction was to be administered where correction was due.  In Bindle there was a strong sense of justice, and his sympathies were all with his mates, who suffered the foreman's insults rather than lose good jobs.  Bindle was always popular with his fellow-workers.  They liked and respected him.  He was free with his money, always ready with a joke or a helping hand, was sober and clean of speech without appearing to notice any defect in others save on very rare occasions. He had been known to fight and beat a bigger man than himself to save a woman from a thrashing, and when Mrs. Bindle had poured down reproaches upon his head on account of his battered appearance, he had silently gone to bed and simulated sleep, although every inch of his body ached.  It was about nine o'clock in the evening that the foreman had seen in Bindle the means of his obtaining some sleep and arriving at his bean-feast refreshed.  At eleven o'clock he left the hotel, after having given to his deputy the most elaborate instructions.  His parting words filled Bindle with unholy joy.  \"If anythin' goes wrong I'll lose my job, and don't you forget it.\" Bindle promised himself that he would not.  \"I'll not forget it, ole son,\" he murmured, with the light of joy in his eyes.  \"I'll not forget it.  It's your beano to-morrow, but it's goin' to be mine to-night.  Last week yer sacked poor ole Teddy Snell, an' 'im wi' seven kids,\" and Bindle smiled as St. George might have smiled on seeing the dragon.  For some time after the foreman's departure, Bindle cogitated as to how to take full advantage of the situation which had thus providentially presented itself.  Plan after plan was put aside as unworthy of the occasion.  There are great possibilities for \"little jokes\" in hotels.  Bindle remembered an early effort of his when a page-boy.  The employment had been short-lived, for on his first day the corridors were being recarpeted.  The sight of a large box of exceedingly long carpet nails left by the workmen at night had given him an idea.  He had crept from his room and carefully lifted the carpet for the whole length of the corridor, inserting beneath it scores of carpet nails points upwards; later he had sounded the fire alarm and watched with glee the visitors rush from their rooms only to dance about in anguish on the points of the nails, uttering imprecations and blasphemies.  This effort had cost him his job and a thrashing from his father, but it had been worth it.  It was, however, merely the crude attempt of a child.  It was one of the chambermaids, a rosy-cheeked girl recently up from the country, who gave Bindle the idea he had been seeking.  As he was unscrewing the numbers with all the elaborate caution of a burglar, he felt a hand upon his shoulder, and found the chambermaid beside him.  \"Mind you put them numbers back right,\" she whispered, \"or I shan't know t'other from which.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],["title","Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#0)"],["body","BULFINCH'S MYTHOLOGY                          THE AGE OF FABLE                       Revised by Rev.

Chapter I  Introduction  The literature of our time, as of all the centuries of Christendom, is full of allusions to the gods and goddesses of the Greeks and Romans.  Occasionally, and, in modern days, more often, it contains allusions to the worship and the superstitions of the northern nations of Europe.  The object of this book is to teach readers who are not yet familiar with the writers of Greece and Rome, or the ballads or legends of the Scandinavians, enough of the stories which form what is called their mythology, to make those allusions intelligible which one meets every day, even in the authors of our own time.  The Greeks and Romans both belong to the same race or stock.  It is generally known in our time as the Aryan family of mankind; and so far as we know its history, the Greeks and Romans descended from the tribes which emigrated from the high table- lands of Northern India.  Other tribes emigrated in different directions from the same centre, so that traces of the Aryan language are found in the islands of the Pacific ocean.  The people of this race, who moved westward, seem to have had a special fondness for open air nature, and a willingness to personify the powers of nature.  They were glad to live in the open air, and they specially encouraged the virtues which an open-air people prize.  Thus no Roman was thought manly who could not swim, and every Greek exercised in the athletic sports of the palaestra.  The Romans and Grecian and German divisions of this great race are those with which we have most to do in history and in literature.  Our own English language is made up of the dialects of different tribes, many of whom agreed in their use of words which they had derived from our Aryan ancestry.  Thus our substantive"]]]
