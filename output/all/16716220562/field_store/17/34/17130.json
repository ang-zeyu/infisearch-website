But what foul offences can there be against Thee, who canst not be defiled? or what acts of violence against Thee, who canst not be harmed? But Thou avengest what men commit against themselves, seeing also when they sin against Thee, they do wickedly against their own souls, and iniquity gives itself the lie, by corrupting and perverting their nature, which Thou hast created and ordained, or by an immoderate use of things allowed, or in burning in things unallowed, to that use which is against nature; or are found guilty, raging with heart and tongue against Thee, kicking against the pricks; or when, bursting the pale of human society, they boldly joy in self-willed combinations or divisions, according as they have any object to gain or subject of offence. And these things are done when Thou art forsaken, O Fountain of Life, who art the only and true Creator and Governor of the Universe, and by a self-willed pride, any one false thing is selected therefrom and loved. So then by a humble devoutness we return to Thee; and Thou cleansest us from our evil habits, and art merciful to their sins who confess, and hearest the groaning of the prisoner, and loosest us from the chains which we made for ourselves, if we lift not up against Thee the horns of an unreal liberty, suffering the loss of all, through covetousness of more, by loving more our own private good than Thee, the Good of all.  Amidst these offences of foulness and violence, and so many iniquities, are sins of men, who are on the whole making proficiency; which by those that judge rightly, are, after the rule of perfection, discommended, yet the persons commended, upon hope of future fruit, as in the green blade of growing corn. And there are some, resembling offences of foulness or violence, which yet are no sins; because they offend neither Thee, our Lord God, nor human society; when, namely, things fitting for a given period are obtained for the service of life, and we know not whether out of a lust of having; or when things are, for the sake of correction, by constituted authority punished, and we know not whether out of a lust of hurting. Many an action then which in men's sight is disapproved, is by Thy testimony approved; and many, by men praised, are (Thou being witness) condemned: because the show of the action, and the mind of the doer, and the unknown exigency of the period, severally vary. But when Thou on a sudden commandest an unwonted and unthought of thing, yea, although Thou hast sometime forbidden it, and still for the time hidest the reason of Thy command, and it be against the ordinance of some society of men, who doubts but it is to be done, seeing that society of men is just which serves Thee? But blessed are they who know Thy commands! For all things were done by Thy servants; either to show forth something needful for the present, or to foreshow things to come.  These things I being ignorant of, scoffed at those Thy holy servants and prophets. And what gained I by scoffing at them, but to be scoffed at by Thee, being insensibly and step by step drawn on to those follies, as to believe that a fig-tree wept when it was plucked, and the tree, its mother, shed milky tears? Which fig notwithstanding (plucked by some other's, not his own, guilt) had some Manichaean saint eaten, and mingled with his bowels, he should breathe out of it angels, yea, there shall burst forth particles of divinity, at every moan or groan in his prayer, which particles of the most high and true God had remained bound in that fig, unless they had been set at liberty by the teeth or belly of some \"Elect\" saint! And I, miserable, believed that more mercy was to be shown to the fruits of the earth than men, for whom they were created. For if any one an hungered, not a Manichaean, should ask for any, that morsel would seem as it were condemned to capital punishment, which should be given him.  And Thou sentest Thine hand from above, and drewest my soul out of that profound darkness, my mother, Thy faithful one, weeping to Thee for me, more than mothers weep the bodily deaths of their children. For she, by that faith and spirit which she had from Thee, discerned the death wherein I lay, and Thou heardest her, O Lord; Thou heardest her, and despisedst not her tears, when streaming down, they watered the ground under her eyes in every place where she prayed; yea Thou heardest her. For whence was that dream whereby Thou comfortedst her; so that she allowed me to live with her, and to eat at the same table in the house, which she had begun to shrink from, abhorring and detesting the blasphemies of my error? For she saw herself standing on a certain wooden rule, and a shining youth coming towards her, cheerful and smiling upon her, herself grieving, and overwhelmed with grief. But he having (in order to instruct, as is their wont not to be instructed) enquired of her the causes of her grief and daily tears, and she answering that she was bewailing my perdition, he bade her rest contented, and told her to look and observe, \"That where she was, there was I also.\" And when she looked, she saw me standing by her in the same rule. Whence was this, but that Thine ears were towards her heart? O Thou Good omnipotent, who so carest for every one of us, as if Thou caredst for him only; and so for all, as if they were but one!  Whence was this also, that when she had told me this vision, and I would fain bend it to mean, \"That she rather should not despair of being one day what I was\"; she presently, without any hesitation, replies: \"No; for it was not told me that, 'where he, there thou also'; but 'where thou, there he also'?\" I confess to Thee, O Lord, that to the best of my remembrance (and I have oft spoken of this), that Thy answer, through my waking mother,--that she was not perplexed by the plausibility of my false interpretation, and so quickly saw what was to be seen, and which I certainly had not perceived before she spake,--even then moved me more than the dream itself, by which a joy to the holy woman, to be fulfilled so long after, was, for the consolation of her present anguish, so long before foresignified. For almost nine years passed, in which I wallowed in the mire of that deep pit, and the darkness of falsehood, often assaying to rise, but dashed down the more grievously. All which time that chaste, godly, and sober widow (such as Thou lovest), now more cheered with hope, yet no whit relaxing in her weeping and mourning, ceased not at all hours of her devotions to bewail my case unto Thee. And her prayers entered into Thy presence; and yet Thou sufferedst me to be yet involved and reinvolved in that darkness.  Thou gavest her meantime another answer, which I call to mind; for much I pass by, hasting to those things which more press me to confess unto Thee, and much I do not remember. Thou gavest her then another answer, by a Priest of Thine, a certain Bishop brought up in Thy Church, and well studied in Thy books. Whom when this woman had entreated to vouchsafe to converse with me, refute my errors, unteach me ill things, and teach me good things (for this he was wont to do, when he found persons fitted to receive it), he refused, wisely, as I afterwards perceived. For he answered, that I was yet unteachable, being puffed up with the novelty of that heresy, and had already perplexed divers unskilful persons with captious questions, as she had told him: \"but let him alone a while\" (saith he), \"only pray God for him, he will of himself by reading find what that error is, and how great its impiety.\" At the same time he told her, how himself, when a little one, had by his seduced mother been consigned over to the Manichees, and had not only read, but frequently copied out almost all, their books, and had (without any argument or proof from any one) seen how much that sect was to be avoided; and had avoided it. Which when he had said, and she would not be satisfied, but urged him more, with entreaties and many tears, that he would see me and discourse with me; he, a little displeased at her importunity, saith, \"Go thy ways and God bless thee, for it is not possible that the son of these tears should perish.\" Which answer she took (as she often mentioned in her conversations with me) as if it had sounded from heaven.     BOOK IV   For this space of nine years (from my nineteenth year to my eight-and-twentieth) we lived seduced and seducing, deceived and deceiving, in divers lusts; openly, by sciences which they call liberal; secretly, with a false-named religion; here proud, there superstitious, every where vain. Here, hunting after the emptiness of popular praise, down even to theatrical applauses, and poetic prizes, and strifes for grassy garlands, and the follies of shows, and the intemperance of desires. There, desiring to be cleansed from these defilements, by carrying food to those who were called \"elect\" and \"holy,\" out of which, in the workhouse of their stomachs, they should forge for us Angels and Gods, by whom we might be cleansed. These things did I follow, and practise with my friends, deceived by me, and with me. Let the arrogant mock me, and such as have not been, to their soul's health, stricken and cast down by Thee, O my God; but I would still confess to Thee mine own shame in Thy praise. Suffer me, I beseech Thee, and give me grace to go over in my present remembrance the wanderings of my forepassed time, and to offer unto Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving. For what am I to myself without Thee, but a guide to mine own downfall? or what am I even at the best, but an infant sucking the milk Thou givest, and feeding upon Thee, the food that perisheth not? But what sort of man is any man, seeing he is but a man? Let now the strong and the mighty laugh at us, but let us poor and needy confess unto Thee.  In those years I taught rhetoric,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32974"],["title","The Elements of Blowpipe Analysis (#0)"],["body","https://www.pgdp.net.

PREFACE   These few pages are intended to serve a twofold purpose,--to give the student a general outline of Blowpipe Analysis, and to introduce him to the methods of Determinative Mineralogy.  Every effort has been made to simplify details so that the book may be used in both High Schools and Colleges.  Tables for \"systematic\" examination have been intentionally omitted, for in the author's estimation these tend to dull the student's power of observation, and to make him place little value upon minute details.  The alphabetic arrangement has been followed for the sake of convenience when referring to the book.  The last chapter is not intended to serve as a key to determining the minerals therein described, but rather it is added to give the student exercise in Blowpipe Analysis, and at the same time to point out the _methods_ of Determinative Mineralogy.  Finally, the author would acknowledge his indebtedness to the following works: \"Manual of Qualitative Analysis,\" Fresenius; \"Qualitative Chemical Analysis,\" Venable; Roscoe and Schorlemmer's \"Treatise on Chemistry\"; Foye's \"Hand-Book of Mineralogy\"; Dana's \"Mineralogy\"; Kobell's \"Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien\"; etc.  FREDERICK HUTTON GETMAN.

One of the best and least expensive forms of blowpipe is shown in Fig. 1. This consists, as is seen from the illustration, of a conical-shaped tube of tin closed at the wide end and formed into a mouthpiece at the small end; soldered into the tube at the large end, and at right angles to its axis, is a small brass tube which terminates in a conical tip pierced with a very fine hole. With this pipe it is possible to perform all of the operations of mineral analysis.  Some little practice is necessary to keep the flame steady and to take the breath at the same time.  No rule can well be given to the beginner, but his experience becomes his best guide.   ~Bunsen Flame.~--Any kind of flame can be used for the blowpipe, provided it be not too small; but since almost every laboratory to-day is furnished with gas and the Bunsen burner (Fig. 2), it will only be necessary to describe the use of the flame from this source. Upon examining the Bunsen flame with care, it will be seen that the flame consists of three distinct parts.  A dark inner cone which consists of gas not yet raised to the ignition point. Beyond this there is a luminous cone, where combustion is incomplete owing to lack of oxygen, and outside of this we find the non-luminous cone where the gas is completely burned.  This outer envelope is the hottest portion of the flame, and is known as the \"oxidizing\" flame because there is an excess of oxygen which is imparted to substances placed therein.  The luminous cone is known as the \"reducing\" flame, for in it metallic oxides are reduced, the oxygen being taken up by the small incandescent particles of carbon.  If the air-holes at the base of the Bunsen burner be opened, the two inner cones become elongated, and the flame appears almost colorless.  The blowpipe enables us to get an oxidizing and a reducing flame of better form and greater power. To do this we cut off the air supply at the base of the burner and turn off the gas until the flame is about 1 cm. high; then upon introducing the blowpipe, and blowing a strong continuous jet of air across the Bunsen flame, we produce an oxidizing flame about 4-5 cm. in length. If the tip of the blowpipe be held outside of the Bunsen flame, and the pressure of the stream of air be diminished, we obtain a reducing flame.   ~Supports.~--For supports, charcoal, platinum, and glass are chiefly used. The charcoal should be made from some light wood, such as"]]]
