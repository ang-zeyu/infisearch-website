At any hazard, he was determined, for the sake of the girl, to maintain the semblance of good-fellowship. She, he saw, was cool and collected. Evidently, she had complete trust in him.  For a little while no one answered. Ultimately, the officer who regarded Liège as a joke said shortly, \"Your Sir Grey has made some impudent suggestions. I suppose it is what the Americans call 'bluff'; but bluffing Germany is a dangerous game.\"  \"Newspapers exaggerate such matters,\" said Dalroy.  \"It may be so. Still, you'll be lucky if you get beyond Aachen,\" was the ungracious retort. The speaker refused to give the town its French name.  An hour passed, the third in Cologne, before the train rumbled away into the darkness. The girl pretended to sleep. Indeed, she may have dozed fitfully. Dalroy did not attempt to engage her in talk. The Germans gossiped in low tones. They knew that their nation had spied on the whole world. Naturally, they held every foreigner in their midst as tainted in the same vile way.  From Cologne to Aix-la-Chapelle is only a two hours' run. That night the journey consumed four. Dalroy no longer dared look out when the train stood in a siding. He knew by the sounds that all the dread paraphernalia of war was speeding toward the frontier; but any display of interest on his part would be positively dangerous now; so he, too, closed his eyes.  By this time he was well aware that his real trials would begin at Aix; but he had the philosopher's temperament, and never leaped fences till he reached them.  At one in the morning they entered the station of the last important town in Germany. Holland lay barely three miles away, Belgium a little farther. The goal was near. Dalroy felt that by calmness and quiet determination he and his charming protégé might win through. He was very much taken by Irene Beresford. He had never met any girl who attracted him so strongly. He found himself wondering whether he might contrive to cultivate this strangely formed friendship when they reached England. In a word, the self-denying ordinance popularly attributed to Lord Kitchener was weakening in Captain Arthur Dalroy.  Then his sky dropped, dropped with a bang.  The train had not quite halted when the door was torn open, and a bespectacled, red-faced officer glared in.  \"It is reported from Cologne that there are English in this carriage,\" he shouted.  \"Correct, my friend. There they are!\" said the man who had snarled at Dalroy earlier.  \"You must descend,\" commanded the new-comer. \"You are both under arrest.\"  \"On what charge?\" inquired Dalroy, bitterly conscious of a gasp of terror which came involuntarily from the girl's lips.  \"You are spies. A sentry heard you talking English, and saw you examining troop-trains from the carriage window.\"  So that Bavarian lout had listened to the Prussian officer's taunt, and made a story of his discovery to prove his diligence.  \"We are not spies, nor have we done anything to warrant suspicion,\" said Dalroy quietly. \"I have letters----\"  \"No talk. Out you come!\" and he was dragged forth by a bloated fellow whom he could have broken with his hands. It was folly to resist, so he merely contrived to keep on his feet, whereas the fat bully meant to trip him ignominiously on to the platform.  \"Now you!\" was the order to Irene, and she followed. Half-a-dozen soldiers closed around. There could be no doubting that preparations had been made for their reception.  \"May I have my portmanteau?\" said Dalroy. \"You are acting in error, as I shall prove when given an opportunity.\"  \"Shut your mouth, you damned Englishman\"--that was a favourite phrase on German lips apparently--\"would you dare to argue with me?--Here, one of you, take his bag. Has the woman any baggage? No. Then march them to the----\"  A tall young lieutenant, in the uniform of the Prussian Imperial Guard, dashed up breathlessly.  \"Ah, I was told the train had arrived!\" he cried. \"Yes, I am in search of those two----\"  \"Thank goodness you are here, Von Halwig!\" began Dalroy.  The Guardsman turned on him a face aflame with fury. \"Silence!\" he bellowed. \"I'll soon settle _your_ affair.--Take his papers and money, and put him in a waiting-room till I return,\" he added, speaking to the officer of reserves who had affected the arrest. \"Place the lady in another waiting-room, and lock her in. I'll see that she is not molested. As for this English _schwein-hund_, shoot him at the least sign of resistance.\"  \"But, Herr Lieutenant,\" began the other, whose heavy paunch was a measure of his self-importance, \"I have orders----\"  \"_Ach, was!_ I know! This Englishman is not an ordinary spy. He is a cavalry captain, and speaks our language fluently. Do as I tell you. I shall come back in half-an-hour.--Fräulein, you are in safer hands. You, I fancy, will be well treated.\"  Dalroy said not a word. He saw at once that some virus had changed Von Halwig's urbanity to bitter hatred. He was sure the Guardsman had been drinking, but that fact alone would not account for such an amazing _volte-face_. Could it be that Britain had thrown in her lot with France? In his heart of hearts he hoped passionately that the rumour was true. And he blazed, too, into a fierce if silent resentment of the Prussian's satyr-like smile at Irene Beresford. But what could he do? Protest was worse than useless. He felt that he would be shot or bayoneted on the slightest pretext.  Von Halwig evidently resented the presence of a crowd of gaping onlookers.  \"No more talk!\" he ordered sharply. \"Do as I bid you, Herr Lieutenant of Reserves!\"  \"Captain Dalroy!\" cried the girl in a voice of utter dismay, \"don't let them part us!\"  Von Halwig pointed to a door. \"In there with him!\" he growled, and Dalroy was hustled away. Irene screamed, and tried to avoid the Prussian's outstretched hand. He grasped her determinedly.  \"Don't be a fool!\" he hissed in English. \"_I_ can save you. He is done with. A firing-party or a rope will account for him at daybreak. Ah! calm yourself, _gnädiges Fräulein_. There are consolations, even in war.\"  Dalroy contrived, out of the tail of his eye, to see that the distraught girl was led toward a ladies' waiting-room, two doors from the apartment into which he was thrust. There he was searched by the lieutenant of reserves, not skilfully, because the man missed nearly the whole of his money, which he carried in a pocket in the lining of his waistcoat. All else was taken--tickets, papers, loose cash, even a cigarette-case and favourite pipe.  The instructions to the sentry were emphatic: \"Don't close the door! Admit no one without sending for me! Shoot or stab the prisoner if he moves!\"  And the fat man bustled away. The station was swarming with military big-wigs. He must remain in evidence.  During five long minutes Dalroy reviewed the situation. Probably he would be executed as a spy. At best, he could not avoid internment in a fortress till the end of the war. He preferred to die in a struggle for life and liberty. Men had escaped in conditions quite as desperate. Why not he? The surge of impotent anger subsided in his veins, and he took thought.  Outside the open door stood the sentry, holding his rifle, with fixed bayonet, in the attitude of a sportsman who expects a covey of partridges to rise from the stubble. A window of plain glass gave on to the platform. Seemingly, it had not been opened since the station was built. Three windows of frosted glass in the opposite wall were, to all appearance, practicable. Judging by the sounds, the station square lay without. Was there a lock and key on the door? Or a bolt? He could not tell from his present position. The sentry had orders to kill him if he moved. Perhaps the man would not interpret the command literally. At any rate, that was a risk he must take. With head sunk, and hands behind his back, obviously in a state of deep dejection, he began to stroll to and fro. Well, he had a fighting chance. He was not shot forthwith.  A slight commotion on the platform caught his eye, the sentry's as well. A tall young officer, wearing a silver helmet, and accompanied by a glittering staff, clanked past; with him the lieutenant of reserves, gesticulating. Dalroy recognised one of the Emperor's sons; but the sentry had probably never seen the princeling before, and was agape. And there was not only a key but a bolt!  With three noiseless strides, Dalroy was at the door and had slammed it. The key turned easily, and the bolt shot home. Then he raced to the middle window, unfastened the hasp, and raised the lower sash. He counted on the thick-headed sentry wasting some precious seconds in trying to force the door, and he was right. As it happened, before the man thought of looking in through the platform window Dalroy had not only lowered the other window behind him but dropped from the sill to the pavement between the wall and a covered van which stood there.  Now he was free--free as any Briton could be deemed free in Aix-la-Chapelle at that hour, one man among three army corps, an unarmed Englishman among a bitterly hostile population which recked naught of France or Belgium or Russia, but hated England already with an almost maniacal malevolence.  And Irene Beresford, that sweet-voiced, sweet-faced English girl, was a prisoner at the mercy of a \"big blonde brute,\" a half-drunken, wholly enraged Prussian Junker. The thought rankled and stung. It was not to be borne. For the first time that night Dalroy knew what fear was, and in a girl's behalf, not in his own.  Could he save her? Heaven had befriended him thus far; would a kindly Providence clear his brain and nerve his spirit to achieve an almost impossible rescue?  The prayer was formless and unspoken, yet it was answered. He had barely gathered his wits after that long drop of nearly twelve feet into the station yard before he was given a vague glimpse of a means of delivering the girl from her immediate peril."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33622"],["title","The Day of Wrath: A Story of 1914 (#3)"],["body"," II  IN THE VORTEX   The van, one among a score of similar vehicles, was backed against the curb of a raised path. At the instant Dalroy quitted the window-ledge a railway employé appeared from behind another van on the left, and was clearly bewildered by seeing a well-dressed man springing from such an unusual and precarious perch.  The new-comer, a big, burly fellow, who wore a peaked and lettered cap, a blouse, baggy breeches, and sabots, and carried a lighted hand-lamp, looked what, in fact, he was--an engine-cleaner. In all likelihood he guessed that any one choosing such a curious exit from a waiting-room was avoiding official scrutiny. He hurried forward at once, holding the lamp above his head, because it was dark behind the row of vans.  \"Hi, there!\" he cried. \"A word with you, _Freiherr_!\" The title, of course, was a bit of German humour. Obviously, he was bent on investigating matters. Dalroy did not run. In the street without he heard the tramp of marching troops, the jolting of wagons, the clatter of horses. He knew that a hue and cry could have only one result--he would be pulled down by a score of hands. Moreover, with the sight of that suspicious Teuton face, its customary boorish leer now replaced by a surly inquisitiveness, came the first glimmer of a fantastically daring way of rescuing Irene Beresford.  He advanced, smiling pleasantly. \"It's all right, Heinrich,\" he said. \"I've arrived by train from Berlin, and the station was crowded. Being an acrobat, I took a bounce. What?\"  The engine-cleaner was not a quick-witted person. He scowled, but allowed Dalroy to come near--too near.  \"I believe you're a _verdammt_ Engl----\" he began.  But the popular German description of a Briton died on his lips, because Dalroy put a good deal of science and no small leaven of brute force into a straight punch which reached that cluster of nerves known to pugilism as \"the point.\" The German fell as though he had been pole-axed, and his thick skull rattled on the pavement.  Dalroy grabbed the lamp before the oil could gush out, placed it upright on the ground, and divested the man of blouse, baggy breeches, and sabots. Luckily, since every second was precious, he found that he was able to wedge his boots into the sabots, which he could not have kept on his feet otherwise. His training as a soldier had taught him the exceeding value of our Fifth Henry's advice to the British army gathered before Harfleur:       In peace there's nothing so becomes a man      As modest stillness and humility;      But when the blast of war blows in our ears      Then imitate the action of the tiger.  The warring tiger does not move slowly. Half-a-minute after his would-be captor had crashed headlong to the hard cobbles of Aix-la-Chapelle, Dalroy was creeping between two wagons, completing a hasty toilet by tearing off collar and tie, and smearing his face and hands with oil and grease from lamp and cap. Even as he went he heard a window of the waiting-room being flung open, and the excited cries which announced the discovery of a half-naked body lying beneath in the gloom.  He saw now that to every van was harnessed a pair of horses, their heads deep in nose-bags, while men in the uniform of the Commissariat Corps were grouped around an officer who was reading orders. The vans were sheeted in black tarpaulins. With German attention to detail, their destination, contents, and particular allotment were stencilled on the covers in white paint: \"Liège, baggage and fodder, cavalry division, 7th Army Corps.\" He learnt subsequently that this definite legend appeared on front and rear and on both sides.  Thinking quickly, he decided that the burly person whose outer garments he was now wearing had probably been taking a short cut to the station entrance when he received the surprise of his life. Somewhat higher up on the right, therefore, Dalroy went back to the narrow pavement close to the wall, and saw some soldiers coming through a doorway a little ahead. He made for this, growled a husky \"Good-morning\" to a sentry stationed there, entered, and mounted a staircase. Soon he found himself on the main platform; he actually passed a sergeant and some Bavarian soldiers, bent on recapturing the escaped prisoner, rushing wildly for the same stairs.  None paid heed to him as he lumbered along, swinging the lamp.  A small crowd of officers, among them the youthful prince in the silver _Pickel-haube_, had collected near the broken window and now open door of the waiting-room from which the \"spy\" had vanished. Within was the fat lieutenant of reserves, gesticulating violently at a pallid sentry.  The prince was laughing. \"He can't get away,\" he was saying. \"A bold rascal. He must be quieted with a bayonet-thrust. That's the best way to inoculate an Englishman with German _Kultur_.\"  Of course this stroke of rare wit evoked much mirth. Meanwhile, Dalroy was turning the key in the lock which held Irene Beresford in safe keeping until Von Halwig had discharged certain pressing duties as a staff officer.  The girl, who was seated, gave him a terrified glance when he entered, but dropped her eyes immediately until she became aware that this rough-looking visitor was altering the key. Dalroy then realised by her startled movement that his appearance had brought fresh terror to an already overburthened heart. Hitherto, so absorbed was he in his project, he had not given a thought to the fact that he would offer a sinister apparition.  \"Don't scream, or change your position, Miss Beresford,\" he said quietly in English. \"It is I, Captain Dalroy. We have a chance of escape. Will you take the risk?\"  The answer came, brokenly it is true, but with the girl's very soul in the words. \"Thank God!\" she murmured. \"Risk? I would sacrifice ten lives, if I had them, rather than remain here.\"  Somehow, that was the sort of answer Dalroy expected from her. She sought no explanation of his bizarre and extraordinary garb. It was all-sufficient for her that he should have come back. She trusted him implicitly, and the low, earnest words thrilled him to the core.  He saw through the window that no one was paying any attention to this apartment. Possibly, the only people who knew that it contained an Englishwoman as a prisoner were Von Halwig and the infuriated lieutenant of reserves.  Jumping on to a chair, Dalroy promptly twisted an electric bulb out of its socket, and plunged the room in semi-darkness, which he increased by hiding the hand-lamp in the folds of his blouse. Given time, no doubt, a dim light would be borrowed from the platform and the windows overlooking the square; in the sudden gloom, however, the two could hardly distinguish each other.  \"I have contrived to escape, in a sense,\" said Dalroy; \"but I could not bear the notion of leaving you to your fate. You can either stop here and take your chance, or come with me. If we are caught together a second time these brutes will show you no mercy. On the other hand, by remaining, you may be fairly well treated, and even sent home soon.\"  He deemed himself in honour bound to put what seemed then a reasonable alternative before her. He did truly believe, in that hour, that Germany might, indeed, wage war inflexibly, but with clean hands, as befitted a nation which prided itself on its ideals and warrior spirit. He was destined soon to be enlightened as to the true significance of the _Kultur_ which a jack-boot philosophy offers to the rest of the world.  But Irene Beresford's womanly intuition did not err. One baleful gleam from Von Halwig's eyes had given her a glimpse of infernal depths to which Dalroy was blind as yet. \"Not only will I come with you; but, if you have a pistol or a knife, I implore you to kill me before I am captured again,\" she said.  Here, then, was no waste of words, but rather the ring of finely-tempered steel. Dalroy unlocked the door, and looked out. To the right and in front the platform was nearly empty. On the left the group of officers was crowding into the waiting-room, since some hint of unfathomable mystery had been wafted up from the Bavarians in the courtyard, and the slim young prince, curious as a street lounger, had gone to the window to investigate.  Dalroy stood in the doorway. \"Pull down your veil, turn to the right, and keep close to the wall,\" he said. \"Don't run! Don't even hurry! If I seem to lag behind, speak sharply to me in German.\"  She obeyed without hesitation. They had reached the end of the covered-in portion of the station when a sentry barred the way. He brought his rifle with fixed bayonet to the \"engage.\"  \"It is forbidden,\" he said.  \"What is forbidden?\" grinned Dalroy amiably, clipping his syllables, and speaking in the roughest voice he could assume.  \"You cannot pass this way.\"  \"Good! Then I can go home to bed. That will be better than cleaning engines.\"  Fortunately, a Bavarian regiment was detailed for duty at Aix-la-Chapelle that night; the sentry knew where the engine-sheds were situated no more than Dalroy. Further, he was not familiar with the Aachen accent.  \"Oh, is that it?\" he inquired.  \"Yes. Look at my cap!\"  Dalroy held up the lantern. The official lettering was evidently convincing.  \"But what about the lady?\"  \"She's my wife. If you're here in half-an-hour she'll bring you some coffee. One doesn't leave a young wife at home with so many soldiers about.\"  \"If you both stand chattering here neither of you will get any coffee,\" put in Irene emphatically.  The Bavarian lowered his rifle. \"I'm relieved at two o'clock,\" he said with a laugh. \"Lose no time, _schoene Frau_. There won't be much coffee on the road to Liège.\"  The girl passed on, but Dalroy lingered. \"Is that where you're going?\" he asked.  \"Yes. We're due in Paris in three weeks.\"  \"Lucky dog!\"  \"Hans, are you coming, or shall I go on alone?\" demanded Irene.  \"Farewell, comrade, for a little ten minutes,\" growled Dalroy, and he followed.  An empty train stood in a bay on the"]]]
