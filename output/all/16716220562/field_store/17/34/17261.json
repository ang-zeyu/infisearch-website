He went on coolly,--  “I know what you are going to say; there is no handbook of medical jurisprudence which does not peremptorily settle the question you ask me. I have studied these handbooks, these formidable weapons which you gentlemen of the bar know so well how to handle. I know the opinions of a Devergie and an Orfila, I know even what Casper and Tardieu, and a host of others teach on that subject. I am fully aware that these gentlemen claim to be able to tell you by the inch at what distance a shot has been fired. But I am not so skilful. I am only a poor country-practitioner, a simple healer of diseases. And before I give an opinion which may cost a poor devil his life, innocent though he be, I must have time to reflect, to consult data, and to compare other cases in my practice.”  He was so evidently right in reality, if not in form, that even M. Galpin gave way.  “It is merely as a matter of information that I request your opinion, sir,” he replied. “Your real and carefully-considered professional opinion will, of course, be given in a special statement.”  “Ah, if that is the case!”  “Pray, inform me, then unofficially, what you think of the nature of the wounds of Count Claudieuse.”  Dr. Seignebos settled his spectacles ceremoniously on his nose, and then replied,--  “My impression, so far as I am now able to judge, is that the count has stated the facts precisely as they were. I am quite ready to believe that the murderer was lying in ambush behind one of the piles of wood, and at the distance which he has mentioned. I am also able to affirm that the two shots were fired at different distances,--one much nearer than the other. The proof of it lies in the nature of the wounds, one of which, near the hip may be scientifically called”--  “But we know at what distance a ball is spent,” broke in M. Seneschal, whom the doctor’s dogmatic tone began to annoy.  “Ah, do we know that, indeed? You know it, M. Seneschal? Well, I declare I do not know it. To be sure, I bear in mind, what you seem to forget, that we have no longer, as in former days, only three or four kinds of guns. Did you think of the immense variety of fire-arms, French and English, American and German, which are nowadays found in everybody’s hands? Do you not see, you who have been a lawyer and a magistrate, that the whole legal question will be based upon this grave and all-important point?”  Thereupon the physician resumed his instruments, resolved to give no other answer, and was about to go to work once more when fearful cries were heard without; and the lawyers, the mayor, and the countess herself, rushed at once to the door.  These cries were, unfortunately, not uttered without cause. The roof of the main building had just fallen in, burying under its ruins the poor drummer who had a few hours ago beaten the alarm, and one of the firemen, the most respected carpenter in Sauveterre, and a father of five children.  Capt. Parenteau seemed to be maddened by this disaster; and all vied with each other in efforts to rescue the poor fellows, who were uttering shrieks of horror that rose high above the crash of falling timbers. But all their endeavors were unavailing. One of the gendarmes and a farmer, who had nearly succeeded in reaching the sufferers, barely escaped being burnt themselves, and were only rescued after having been dangerously injured. Then only it seemed as if all became fully aware of the abominable crime committed by the incendiary. Then only the clouds of smoke and the columns of fire, which rose high into the air, were accompanied by fierce cries of vengeance rising heavenwards.  “Death to the incendiary! Death!”  At the moment M. Seneschal felt himself inspired with a sudden thought. He knew how cautious peasants are, and how difficult it is to make them tell what they know. He climbed, therefore, upon a heap of fallen beams, and said in a clear, loud voice,--  “Yes, my friends, you are right: death to the incendiary! Yes, the unfortunate victims of the basest of all crimes must be avenged. We must find out the incendiary; we must! You want it to be done, don’t you? Well, it depends only on you. There must be some one among you who knows something about this matter. Let him come forward and tell us what he has seen or heard. Remember that the smallest trifle may be a clew to the crime. You would be as bad as the incendiary himself, if you concealed him. Just think it over, consider.”  Loud voices were heard in the crowd; then suddenly a voice said,--  “There is one here who can tell.”  “Who?”  “Cocoleu. He was there from the beginning. It was he who went and brought the children of the countess out of their room. What has become of him?--Cocoleu, Cocoleu!”  One must have lived in the country, among these simple-minded peasants, to understand the excitement and the fury of all these men and women as they crowded around the ruins of Valpinson. People in town do not mind brigands, in general: they have their gas, their strong doors, and the police. They are generally little afraid of fire. They have their fire-alarms; and at the first spark the neighbor cries, “Fire!” The engines come racing up; and water comes forth as if by magic. But it is very different in the country: here every man is constantly under a sense of his isolation. A simple latch protects his door; and no one watches over his safety at night. If a murderer should attack him, his cries could bring no help. If fire should break out, his house would be burnt down before the neighbors could reach it; and he is happy who can save his own life and that of his family. Hence all these good people, whom the mayor’s words had deeply excited, were eager to find out the only man who knew anything about this calamity, Cocoleu.  He was well known among them, and for many years.  There was not one among them who had not given him a piece of bread, or a bowl of soup, when he was hungry; not one of them had ever refused him a night’s rest on the straw in his barn, when it was raining or freezing, and the poor fellow wanted a shelter.  For Cocoleu was one of those unfortunate beings who labor under a grievous physical or moral deformity.  Some twenty years ago, a wealthy land-owner in Brechy had sent to the nearest town for half a dozen painters, whom he kept at his house nearly a whole summer, painting and decorating his newly-built house. One of these men had seduced a girl in the neighborhood, whom he had bewitched by his long white blouse, his handsome brown mustache, his good spirits, gay songs, and flattering speeches. But, when the work was done, the tempter had flown away with the others, without thinking any more of the poor girl than of the last cigar which he had smoked.  And yet she was expecting a child. When she could no longer conceal her condition, she was turned out of the house in which she had been employed; and her family, unable to support themselves, drove her away without mercy. Overcome with grief, shame, and remorse, poor Colette wandered from farm to farm, begging, insulted, laughed at, beaten even at times. Thus it came about, that in a dark wood, one dismal winter evening, she gave life to a male child. No one ever understood how mother and child managed to survive. But both lived; and for many a year they were seen in and around Sauveterre, covered with rags, and living upon the dear-bought generosity of the peasants.  Then the mother died, utterly forsaken by human help, as she had lived. They found her body, one morning, in a ditch by the wayside.  The child survived alone. He was then eight years old, quite strong and tall for his age. A farmer took pity on him, and took him home. The little wretch was not fit for anything: he could not even keep his master’s cows. During his mother’s lifetime, his silence, his wild looks, and his savage appearance, had been attributed to his wretched mode of life. But when people began to be interested in him, they found out that his intellect had never been aroused. He was an idiot, and, besides, subject to that terrible nervous affection which at times shakes the whole body and disfigures the face by the violence of uncontrollable convulsions. He was not a deaf-mute; but he could only stammer out with intense difficulty a few disjointed syllables. Sometimes the country people would say to him,--  “Tell us your name, and you shall have a cent.”  Then it took him five minutes’ hard work to utter, amid a thousand painful contortions, the name of his mother.  “Co-co-co-lette.”  Hence came his name Cocoleu. It had been ascertained that he was utterly unable to do anything; and people ceased to interest themselves in his behalf. The consequence was, that he became a vagabond as of old.  It was about this time that Dr. Seignebos, on one of his visits, met him one day on the public road.  This excellent man had, among other extraordinary notions, the conviction that idiocy is nothing more than a defective state of the brains, which may be remedied by the use of certain well-known substances, such as phosphorus, for instance. He lost no time in seizing upon this admirable opportunity to test his theory. Cocoleu was sent for, and installed in his house. He subjected him to a treatment which he kept secret; and only a druggist at Sauveterre, who was also well known as entertaining very extraordinary notions, knew what had happened. At the end of eighteen months, Cocoleu had fallen off terribly: he talked perhaps, a little more fluently; but his intellect had not been perceptibly improved.  Dr. Seignebos was discouraged. He made up a parcel of things which he had given to his patient, put it into his hands, pushed him out of his door, and told him never to come back again.  The doctor had rendered Cocoleu a sad service. The poor idiot had lost the habit of privation: he had forgotten how to go from door to door, asking for alms; and he would have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3336"],["title","Within an Inch of His Life (#5)"],["body","d, if his good fortune had not led him to knock at the door of the house at Valpinson.  Count Claudieuse and his wife were touched by his wretchedness, and determined to take charge of him. They gave him a room and a bed at one of the farmhouses; but they could never induce him to stay there. He was by nature a vagabond; and the instinct was too strong for him. In winter, frost and snow kept him in for a little while; but as soon as the first leaves came out, he went wandering again through forest and field, remaining absent often for weeks altogether.  At last, however, something seemed to have been aroused in him, which looked like the instinct of a domesticated animal. His attachment to the countess resembled that of a dog, even in the capers and cries with which he greeted her whenever he saw her. Often, when she went out, he accompanied her, running and frolicking around her just like a dog. He was also very fond of little girls, and seemed to resent it when he was kept from them: for people were afraid his nervous attacks might affect the children.  With time he had also become capable of performing some simple service. He could be intrusted with certain messages: he could water the flowers, summon a servant, or even carry a letter to the post-office at Brechy. His progress in this respect was so marked, that some of the more cunning peasants began to suspect that Cocoleu was not so “innocent,”  after all, as he looked, and that he was cleverly playing the fool in order to enjoy life easily.  “We have him at last,” cried several voices at once. “Here he is; here he is!”  The crowd made way promptly; and almost immediately a young man appeared, led and pushed forward by several persons. Cocoleu’s clothes, all in disorder, showed clearly that he had offered a stout resistance. He was a youth of about eighteen years, very tall, quite beardless, excessively thin, and so loosely jointed, that he looked like a hunchback. A mass of reddish hair came down his low, retreating forehead. His small eyes, his enormous mouth bristling with sharp teeth, his broad flat nose, and his immense ears, gave to his face a strange idiotic expression, and to his whole appearance a most painful brutish air.  “What must we do with him?” asked the peasants of the mayor.  “We must take him before the magistrate, my friends,” replied M. Seneschal,--“down there in that cottage, where you have carried the count.”  “And we’ll make him talk,” threatened his captors. “You hear! Go on, quick!”    IV.  M. Galpin and the doctor had both considered it a point of honor who should show the most perfect indifference; and thus they had betrayed by no sign their curiosity to know what was going on out doors. Dr. Seignebos was on the point of resuming the operation; and, as coolly as if he had been in his own rooms at home, he was washing the sponge which he had just used, and wiping his instruments. The magistrate, on the other hand, was standing in the centre of the room, his arms crossed, his eyes fixed upon the infinite, apparently. It may be he was thinking of his star which had at last brought him that famous criminal case for which he had ardently longed many a year.  Count Claudieuse, however, was very far from sharing their reserve. He was tossing about on his bed; and as soon as the mayor and his friend reappeared, looking quite upset, he exclaimed,--  “What does that uproar mean?”  And, when he had heard of the calamity, he added,--  “Great God! And I was complaining of my losses. Two men killed! That is a real misfortune. Poor men! to die because they were so brave,--Bolton hardly thirty years old; Guillebault, a father of a family, who leaves five children, and not a cent!”  The countess, coming in at that moment, heard his last words.  “As long as we have a mouthful of bread,” she said in a voice full of deep emotion, “neither Bolton’s mother, nor Guillebault’s children, shall ever know what want is.”  She could not say another word; for at that moment the peasants crowded into the room, pushing the prisoner before them.  “Where is the magistrate?” they asked. “Here is a witness!”  “What, Cocoleu!” exclaimed the count.  “Yes, he knows something: he said so himself. We want him to tell it to the magistrate. We want the incendiary to be caught.”  Dr. Seignebos had frowned fiercely. He execrated Cocoleu, whose sight recalled to him that great failure which the good people of Sauveterre were not likely to forget soon.  “You do not really mean to examine him?” he asked, turning to M. Galpin.  “Why not?” answered the magistrate dryly.  “Because he is an imbecile, sir, an idiot. Because he cannot possibly understand your questions, or the importance of his answers.”  “He may give us a valuable hint, nevertheless.”  “He? A man who has no sense? You don’t really think so. The law cannot attach any importance to the evidence of a fool.”  M. Galpin betrayed his impatience by an increase of stiffness, as he replied,--  “I know my duty, sir.”  “And I,” replied the physician,--“I also know what I have to do. You have summoned me to assist you in this investigation. I obey; and I declare officially, that the mental condition of this unfortunate man makes his evidence utterly worthless. I appeal to the commonwealth attorney.”  He had hoped for a word of encouragement from M. Daubigeon; but nothing came. Then he went on,--  “Take care, sir, or you may get yourself into trouble. What would you do if this poor fellow should make a formal charge against any one? Could you attach any weight to his word?”  The peasants were listening with open mouths. One of them said,--  “Oh! Cocoleu is not so innocent as he looks.”  “He can say very well what he wants to say, the scamp!” added another.  “At all events, I am indebted to him for the life of my children,” said the count gently. “He thought of them when I was unconscious, and when no one else remembered them. Come, Cocoleu, come nearer, my friend, don’t be afraid: there is no one here to hurt you.”  It was very well the count used such kind words; for Cocoleu was thoroughly terrified by the brutal treatment he had received, and was trembling in all his limbs.  “I am--not--a--afraid,” he stammered out.  “Once more I protest,” said the physician.  He had found out that he stood not alone in his opinion. Count Claudieuse came to his assistance, saying,--  “I really think it might be dangerous to question Cocoleu.”  But the magistrate was master of the situation, and conscious of all the powers conferred upon him by the laws of France in such cases.  “I must beg, gentlemen,” he said, in a tone which did not allow of any reply,--“I must beg to be permitted to act in my own way.”  And sitting down, he asked Cocoleu,--  “Come, my boy, listen to me, and try to understand what I say. Do you know what has happened at Valpinson?”  “Fire,” replied the idiot.  “Yes, my friend, fire, which burns down the house of your benefactor,--fire, which has killed two good men. But that is not all: they have tried to murder the count. Do you see him there in his bed, wounded, and covered with blood? Do you see the countess, how she suffers?”  Did Cocoleu follow him? His distorted features betrayed nothing of what might be going on within him.  “Nonsense!” growled the doctor, “what obstinacy! What folly!”  M. Galpin heard him, and said angrily,--  “Sir, do not force me to remind you that I have not far from here, men whose duty it is to see that my authority is respected here.”  Then, turning again to the poor idiot, he went on,--  “All these misfortunes are the work of a vile incendiary. You hate him, don’t you; you detest him, the rascal!”  “Yes,” said Cocoleu.  “You want him to be punished, don’t you?”  “Yes, yes!”  “Well, then you must help me to find him out, so that the gendarmes may catch him, and put him in jail. You know who it is; you have told these people and”--  He paused, and after a moment, as Cocoleu kept silent, he asked,--  “But, now I think of it, whom has this poor fellow talked to?”  Not one of the peasants could tell. They inquired; but no answer came. Perhaps Cocoleu had never said what he was reported to have said.  “The fact is,” said one of the tenants at Valpinson, “that the poor devil, so to say, never sleeps, and that he is roaming about all night around the house and the farm buildings.”  This was a new light for M. Galpin; suddenly changing the form of his interrogatory, he asked Cocoleu,--  “Where did you spend the night?”  “In--in--the--court--yard.”  “Were you asleep when the fire broke out?”  “No.”  “Did you see it commence?”  “Yes.”  “How did it commence?”  The idiot looked fixedly at the Countess Claudieuse with the timid and abject expression of a dog who tries to read something in his master’s eyes.  “Tell us, my friend,” said the Countess gently,--“tell us.”  A flash of intelligence shone in Cocoleu’s eyes.  “They--they set it on fire,” he stammered.  “On purpose?”  “Yes.”  “Who?”  “A gentleman.”  There was not a person present at this extraordinary scene who did not anxiously hold his breath as the word was uttered. The doctor alone kept cool, and exclaimed,--  “Such an examination is sheer folly!”  But the magistrate did not seem to hear his words; and, turning to Cocoleu, he asked him, in a deeply agitated tone of voice--  “Did you see the gentleman?”  “Yes.”  “Do you know who he is?”  “Very--very--well.”  “What is his name?”  “Oh, yes!”  “What is his name? Tell us.”  Cocoleu’s features betrayed the fearful anguish of his mind. He hesitated, and at last he answered, making a violent effort,--“Bois--Bois--Boiscoran!”  The name was received with murmurs of indignation and incredulous laughter. There was not a shadow of doubt or of suspicion. The peasants said,--  “M. de Boiscoran an incendiary! Who does he think will believe that story?”  “It is absurd!” said Count Claudieuse.  “Nonsense!” repeated the mayor and his friend.  Dr. Siegnebos had taken off his spectacles, and was wiping them"]]]
