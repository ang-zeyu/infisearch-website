This is the pail which I found in the shed. No doubt it belongs to the Jaquinot household. Now, I have told you the actual truth. I ask nothing for myself. If I stay here, even though you permit it, my presence will certainly bring ruin on you. So I shall go at once. But I _do_ ask you, as Christian people, to safeguard this young English lady, and, when conditions permit, and she has recovered her strength, to guide her into Holland, unless, that is, these German beasts are attacking the Dutch too.\"  For a brief space there was silence. Dalroy looked fixedly at Joos, trying to read Irene Beresford's fate in those black, glowing eyes. The womenfolk were won already; but well he knew that in this Belgian nook the patriarchal principle that a man is lord and master in his own house would find unquestioned acceptance. He was aware that Irene's gaze was riveted on him in a strangely magnetic way. It was one thing that he should say calmly, \"So I picked up a milking-stool, and killed both of them,\" but quite another that Irene should visualise in the light of her rare intelligence the epic force of the tragedy enacted while she lay unconscious in the depths of a hedgerow. Dalroy could tell, Heaven knows how, that her very soul was peering at him. In that tense moment he knew that he was her man for ever. But--_surgit amari aliquid_! A wave of bitterness welled up from heart to brain because of the conviction that if he would, indeed, be her true knight he must leave her within the next few seconds. Yet his resolution did not waver. Not once did his glance swerve from Joos's wizened face.  It was the miller himself who first broke the spell cast on the curiously assorted group by Dalroy's story. He stretched out a hand and took the pail. \"This is fresh milk,\" he said, examining the dregs.  \"Yes. I milked the cow. The poor animal was in pain, and my friend and I wanted the milk.\"  \"You milked the cow--before?\"  \"No. After.\"  _\"Grand Dieu!_ you're English, without doubt.\"  Joos turned the pail upside down, appraising it critically. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it's one of Dupont's. I remember her buying it. She gave him fifty kilos of potatoes for it. She stuck him, he said. Half the potatoes were black. A rare hand at a bargain, the Veuve Jaquinot. And she's dead you tell me. A bayonet thrust?\"  \"Two.\"  Madame Joos burst into hysterical sobbing. Her husband whisked round on her with that singular alertness of movement which was one of his most marked characteristics.  \"Peace, wife!\" he snapped. \"Isn't that what we're all coming to? What matter to Dupont now whether the potatoes were black or sound?\"  Dalroy guessed that Dupont was the iron-monger of Visé. He was gaining a glimpse, too, of the indomitable soul of Belgium. Though itching for information, he checked the impulse, because time pressed horribly.  \"Well,\" he said, \"will you do what you can for the lady? The Germans have spared you. You have fed them. They may treat you decently. I'll make it worth while. I have plenty of money----\"  Irene stood up. \"Monsieur,\" she said, and her voice was sweet as the song of a robin, \"it is idle to speak of saving one without the other. Where Monsieur Dalroy goes I go. If he dies, I die.\"  For the first time since entering the mill Dalroy dared to look at her. In the sharp, crisp light of advancing day her blue eyes held a tint of violet. Tear-drops glistened in the long lashes; but she smiled wistfully, as though pleading for forgiveness.  \"That is sheer nonsense,\" he cried in English, making a miserable failure of the anger he tried to assume. \"You ought to be reasonably safe here. By insisting on remaining with me you deliberately sacrifice both our lives. That is, I mean,\" he added hastily, aware of a slip, \"you prevent me too from taking the chance of escape that offers.\"  \"If that were so I would not thrust myself on you,\" she answered. \"But I know the Germans. I know how they mean to wage war. They make no secret of it. They intend to strike terror into every heart at the outset. They are not men, but super-brutes. You saw Von Halwig at Berlin, and again at Aix-la-Chapelle. If a titled Prussian can change his superficial manners--not his nature, which remains invariably bestial--to that extent in a day, before he has even the excuse of actual war, what will the same man become when roused to fury by resistance? But we must not talk English.\" She turned to Joos. \"Tell us, then, monsieur,\" she said, grave and serious as Pallas Athena questioning Perseus, \"have not the Prussians already ravaged and destroyed Visé?\"  The old man's face suddenly lost its bronze, and became ivory white. His features grew convulsed. He resembled one of those grotesque masks carved by Japanese artists to simulate a demon. \"Curse them!\" he shrilled. \"Curse them in life and in death--man, woman, and child! What has Belgium done that she should be harried by a pack of wolves? Who can say what wolves will do?\"  Joos was aboil with vitriolic passion. There was no knowing how long this tirade might have gone on had not a speckled hen stalked firmly in through the open door with obvious and settled intent to breakfast on crumbs.  \"_Ciel!_\" cackled the orator. \"Not a fowl was fed overnight!\"  In real life, as on the stage, comedy and tragedy oft go hand in hand. But the speckled hen deserved a good meal. Her entrance undoubtedly stemmed the floodtide of her owner's patriotic wrath, and thus enabled the five people in the kitchen to overhear a hoarse cry from the roadway: \"Hi, there, _dummer Esel_! whither goest thou? This is Joos's mill.\"  \"Quick, Léontine!\" cried Joos. \"To the second loft with them! Sharp, now!\"  In this unexpected crisis, Dalroy could neither protest nor refuse to accompany the girl, who led him and Irene up a back stair and through a well-stored granary to a ladder which communicated with a trap-door.  \"I'll bring you some coffee and eggs as soon as I can,\" she whispered. \"Draw up the ladder, and close the door. It's not so bad up there. There's a window, but take care you aren't seen. Maybe,\" she added tremulously, \"you are safer than we now.\"  Dalroy realised that it was best to obey.  \"Courage, mademoiselle!\" he said. \"God is still in heaven, and all will be well with the world.\"  \"Please, monsieur, what became of Jan Maertz?\" she inquired timidly.  \"I'm not quite certain, but I think he fell clear of the wagon. The Germans should not have ill-treated him. The collision was not his fault.\"  The girl sobbed, and left them. Probably the gruff Walloon was her lover.  Irene climbed first. Dalroy followed, raised the ladder noiselessly, and lowered the trap. His brow was seamed with foreboding, as, despite his desire to leave his companion in the care of the miller's household, he had an instinctive feeling that he was acting unwisely. Moreover, like every free man, he preferred to seek the open when in peril. Now he felt himself caged.  Therefore was he amazed when Irene laughed softly. \"How readily you translate Browning into French!\" she said.  He gazed at her in wonderment. Less than an hour ago she had fainted under the stress of hunger and dread, yet here was she talking as though they had met in the breakfast-room of an English country house. He would have said something, but the ancient mill trembled under the sudden crash of artillery. The roof creaked, the panes of glass in the dormer window rattled, and fragments of mortar fell from the walls. Unmindful, for the moment, of Léontine Joos's warning, Dalroy went to the window, which commanded a fine view of the town, river, and opposite heights.  The pontoon bridge was broken. Several pontoons were in splinters. The others were swinging with the current toward each bank. Six Belgian field-pieces had undone the night's labour, and a lively rat-tat of rifles, mixed with the stutter of machine guns, proved that the defenders were busy among the Germans trapped on the north bank. The heavier ordnance brought to the front by the enemy soon took up the challenge; troops occupying the town, which, for the most part, lies on the south bank, began to cover the efforts of the engineers, instantly renewed. History was being written in blood that morning on both sides of the Meuse. The splendid defence offered by a small Belgian force was thwarting the advance of the 9th German Army Corps. Similarly, the 10th and 7th were being held up at Verviers and on the direct road from Aix to Liège respectively. All this meant that General Leman, the heroic commander-in-chief at Liège, was given most precious time to garrison that strong fortress, construct wire entanglements, lay mines, and destroy roads and railways, which again meant that Von Emmich's sledge-hammer blows with three army corps failed to overwhelm Liège in accordance with the dastardly plan drawn up by the German staff.  Dalroy, though he might not realise the marvellous fact then, was in truth a spectator of a serious German defeat. Even in the conditions, he was aglow with admiration for the pluck of the Belgians in standing up so valiantly against the merciless might of Germany. The window was dust-laden as the outcome of earlier gun-fire, and he was actually on the point of opening it when Irene stopped him.  \"Those men below may catch sight of you,\" she said.  He stepped back hurriedly. Two forage-carts had been brought into the yard, and preparations were being made to load them with oats and hay. A truculent-looking sergeant actually lifted his eyes to that particular window. But he could not see through the dimmed panes, and was only estimating the mill's probable contents.  Dalroy laughed constrainedly. \"You are the better soldier of the two,\" he said. \"I nearly blundered. Still, I wish the window was open. I want to size up the chances of the Belgians. Those are bigger guns which are answering, and a duel between big guns and little ones can have only"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33623"],["title","The Inventions of the Idiot (#0)"],["body","TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: Apart from a few punctuation corrections, no     other changes have been made in the text.

We, however, must grin and bear it, because our esteemed landlady cannot find anywhere in this town a woman better suited for the labors of the kitchen than the blank she has had the misfortune to draw in the culinary lottery, familiarly known to us, her victims, as Bridget.\"  \"This is an exceptional case,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"We haven't had a steak like this before in several weeks.\"  \"True,\" returned the Idiot. \"This is a sirloin, I believe. The last steak we had was a rump steak, and it was not burned to a crisp, I admit. It was only boiled, if I remember rightly, by mistake; Bridget having lost her fifth consecutive cousin in ten days the night before, and being in consequence so prostrated that she could not tell a gridiron from a lawn-mower.\"  \"Well, you know the popular superstition, Mr. Idiot,\" said the Poet. \"The devil sends the cooks.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" retorted the Idiot. \"That's one of those proverbs that haven't a particle of truth in 'em--nor a foundation in reason either, like 'Never look a gift horse in the mouth.' Of all absurd advice ever given to man by a thoughtless thinker, that, I think, bears the palm. I know a man who didn't look a gift horse in the mouth, and the consequence was that he accepted a horse that was twenty-eight years old. The beast died in his stables three days later, and the beneficiary had to pay five dollars to have him carted away. As for the devil sending the cooks, I haven't any faith in the theory. Any person who had come from the devil would know how to manage a fire better than ninety-nine per cent. of the cooks ever born. It would be a good thing if every one of 'em were forced to serve an apprenticeship with the Prince of Darkness. However, steak like this serves a good purpose. It serves to bind our little circle more firmly together. There's nothing like mutual suffering to increase the sympathy that should exist between men situated as we are; and as for Mrs. Smithers-Pedagog, I wish her to understand distinctly that I am criticising the cook and not herself. If this particular dainty had been prepared by her own fair hand, I doubt not I should want more of it.\"  \"I thank you,\" returned the landlady, somewhat mollified by this remark. \"If I had more time I should occasionally do the cooking myself, but, as it is, I am overwhelmed with work.\"  \"I can bear witness to that,\" observed Mr. Whitechoker. \"Mrs. Smithers-Pedagog is one of the most useful ladies in my congregation. If it were not for her, many a heathen would be going without garments to-day.\"  \"Well, I don't like to criticise,\" said the Idiot, \"but I think the heathen at home should be considered before the heathen abroad. If your congregation would have a guild to look after such heathen as the Poet and the Doctor and myself, I am convinced it would be more appreciated by those who benefited by its labors than it is at present by the barbarians who try to wear the misfits it sends out. A Christian whose plain but honest breakfast is well cooked is apt to be far more grateful than a barbarian who is wearing a pair of trousers made of calico and a coat three sizes too small in the body and nine sizes too large in the arms. I will go further. I believe that if the domestic heathen were cared for they would do much better work, would earn better pay, and would, out of mere gratitude, set apart a sufficiently large portion of their increased earnings to be devoted to the purchase of tailor-made costumes, which would please the cannibals better, far better, than the amateur creations they now get. I know I'd contribute some of my surplus.\"  \"What would you have such a guild do?\" queried Mr. Whitechoker.  \"Do? There'd be so much for it to do that the members could hardly find time to rest,\" returned the Idiot. \"Do? Why, my dear sir, take this house, for instance, and see what it could do here. What a boon it would be for me if some kind-hearted person would come here once a week and sew buttons on my clothes, darn my socks--in short, keep me mended. What better work for one who desires to make the world brighter, happier, and less sinful!\"  \"I fail to see how the world would be brighter, happier, or less sinful if your suspender-buttons were kept firm, and your stockings darned, and your wardrobe generally mended,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I grant that such a guild would be doing a noble work if it would take you in hand and correct many of your impressions, revise your well-known facts so as to bring them more in accord with indubitable truths, and impart to your customs some of that polish which you so earnestly strive for in your dress.\"  \"Thank you,\" said the Idiot, suavely. \"But I don't wish to overburden the kind ladies to whom I refer. If my costumes could be looked after I might find time to look after my customs, and, I assure you, Mr. Pedagog, if at any time you will undertake to deliver a course of lectures on Etiquette, I will gladly subscribe for two orchestra-chairs and endeavor to occupy both of them. At any rate, to return to the main point, I claim that the world would be happier and brighter and less sinful if the domestic heathen were kept mended by such a guild, and I challenge any one here to deny, even on so slight a basis as the loose suspender-button, the truth of what I say. When I arise in the morning and find a button gone, do I make genial remarks about the joys of life? I do not. I use words. Sometimes one word, which need not be repeated here. I am unhappy, and, being unhappy, the world seems dark and dreary, and in speaking impatiently, though very much to the point, as I do, I am guilty of an offence that is sinful. With such a start in the morning, I come here to the table. Mr. Pedagog sees that I am not quite myself. He asks me if I am not feeling well, an irritating question at any time, but particularly so to a man with a suspender-button gone. I retort. He re-retorts, until our converse is warmer than the coffee, and our relations colder than the waffles. Finally I leave the house, slamming the door behind me, structurally weakening the house, and go to business, where I wreak my vengeance upon the second clerk, who takes it out of the office-boy, who goes home and vents his wrath on his little sister, who, goaded into recklessness, teases the baby until he yells and gets spanked by his mother for being noisy. Now, why should a loose suspender-button be allowed to subject that baby to such humiliation, and who can deny that, if it had been properly sewed on by a guild, such as I have mentioned, the baby never would have been spanked for the causes mentioned? What is _your_ answer, Mr. Whitechoker?\"  \"Truly, I am so breathless at your logic that I cannot reason,\" said the Minister. \"But haven't we digressed a little? We were speaking of cooks, and we conclude with a pathetic little allegory about a suspender-button and a baby that is not only teased but spanked.\"  \"The baby could get the same spanking for reasons based on the shortcomings of the cooks,\" said the Idiot. \"I am irritated when I am served with green pease hard enough to batter down Gibraltar if properly aimed; when my coffee is a warmed-over reminiscence of last night's demi-tasse, I leave the house in a frame of mind that bodes ill for the junior clerk, and the effect on the baby is ultimately the same.\"  \"And--er--you'd have the ladies whose energies are now devoted towards the clothing of the heathen come here and do the cooking?\" queried the School-master.  \"I leave if they do,\" said the Doctor. \"I have seen too much of the effects of amateur cookery in my profession to want any of it. They are good cooks in theory, but not in practice.\"  \"There you have it!\" said the Idiot, triumphantly. \"Right in a nutshell. That's where the cooks are"]]]
