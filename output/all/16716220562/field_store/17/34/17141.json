Jeanne's interest was aroused at once, and she looked about her. In the rear of the car were a number of soldiers clad in blue. They seemed in high spirits and were singing lustily:      \"'Yes, we'll rally round the flag, boys,       We'll rally once again,     Shouting the battle cry of freedom;     We will rally from the hillside,       We will rally from the plain,     Shouting the battle cry of freedom.'\"  \"They are going to the war with a song upon their lips, perhaps to be killed, while I am afraid because I am alone,\" mused Jeanne, her lip curling in self-contempt. \"I don't believe that girls amount to much after all.\"      \"'We are marching to the field, boys,       Going to the fight,     Shouting the battle cry of freedom!     And we'll bear the glorious Stars       Of the Union and the Right,     Shouting the battle cry of freedom.'\"  \"I will be brave,\" and the girl sat up very straight. \"I will not be afraid any more, for I, too, am battling for the right. I am just as truly serving my country as they are, and I will be just as brave. Besides, father would be sorry if he knew that I felt so bad.\"  Drying her eyes she listened attentively to the soldiers as they sang, one after another, the martial airs that had become so popular since the breaking out of the war. After a little time they struck up \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" and then there followed a scene that the girl never forgot. Men, women and children caught the enthusiasm and, rising to their feet, joined in the song. Jeanne sang too, as she had never sung before. The words held a new meaning for her. She felt once more an exaltation of spirit and a kinship with these brave fellows who were willing to give their lives for their country. What was danger, disease or life itself, if she could be of service in ever so small a way?      \"''Tis the Star Spangled Banner,       O long may it wave     O'er the land of the free       And the home of the brave.'\"  A mighty shout went up as the final chorus was rendered, and three cheers for the flag were given with a vim that mingled musically with the rush and roar of the train. Flushed and breathless Jeanne sank back into her seat, her eyes shining, her cheeks glowing, her whole being thrilled with patriotic fervor. She was no longer fearful and lonely, but eager and ready to do and dare all things needful for the success of her mission.  And so when Washington was reached the girl took up her satchel with quite the air of an old traveler and, accosting an official, asked about her train with the utmost self-possession.  She had but a short time to wait before she was once more flying across the country en route for Cincinnati. The night passed without incident. The journey was tiresome but so uneventful that she became imbued with confidence in her ability to travel alone and made her change to the Memphis and Charleston Railroad for Memphis at Cincinnati without trouble.  The day had been very warm and as Jeanne took her seat in the coach she heaved a sigh of relief as she saw the sun sinking to his rest.  \"It will be cooler now,\" she said to herself, settling comfortably back in the cushions. \"I am glad that I have the seat to myself.\"  But to her dismay at the next station a rough-looking man entered the car and took possession of the seat beside her. The girl looked intently out of the window, after her first glance at the fellow, inwardly hoping that his journey would not be a long one. For some time the man did not pay any attention to her, then he turned abruptly and said:  \"Do you want that window down?\"  \"No; thank you,\" returned Jeanne adopting the manner she had seen her mother use towards people of whom she did not approve.  The man eyed her narrowly, but the girl preserved her composure under his scrutiny.  \"What's yer got in yer basket?\" he demanded presently.  A look of indignation flashed over Jeanne's face. She opened her lips to reply. \"None of your business,\" as some of the girls she knew would have done, but something that her mother had once said came into her mind just as she was about to make the retort.  \"My dear,\" her mother had said, \"no matter how rudely others may behave, be a lady. Because some one else has been impolite does not excuse it in you.\"  As this came to Jeanne she closed her lips resolutely and, turning her back very decidedly, looked out of the window.  \"Yer needn't put on any of yer airs with me,\" growled the fellow, who was evidently in a surly humor. \"Can't yer answer a civil question?\"  Still Jeanne made no reply, and the man reached out to take hold of her basket. But the girl was too quick for him, and lifting it into her lap held on to it tightly while she placed her feet upon her satchel.  \"Yer needn't be so spunky,\" said the fellow sheepishly. \"I jest wanted to see if yer didn't have somethin' to eat.\"  \"If you are hungry, you should have said so,\" said Jeanne, relaxing instantly, for her warm heart was always open to appeals of this nature. She opened her basket and took out some dainty sandwiches. \"You are quite welcome to what you wish to eat,\" she said graciously, \"but you were not very nice about asking for it.\"  \"A feller don't stop fer manners,\" said the man nibbling at the sandwiches gingerly, \"when he's as hungry as I am. Is that all ye've got in there?\"  \"I have some more lunch,\" said Jeanne rather indignantly, for the fellow did not seem very ravenous for a hungry man. \"I shall keep that for the rest of my journey.\"  \"Whar yer goin'? Ain't yer got nobody with yer?\" queried the man a gleam coming into his eyes.  \"Don't you think that you are rather inquisitive?\" questioned Jeanne boldly. \"Why should you want to know where I am going?\"  \"Because folks have to be keerful in times like these,\" said the other brusquely. \"Haven't yer got some money too?\"  \"I have none to give you,\" answered Jeanne. \"And I would rather that you would not sit by me any longer. Will you please go away?\"  \"Not if I knows myself and I think I do,\" laughed the man. \"See here! I'll go away if you will give me your purse. I know that it's in that there basket. You take too much care of it fer it only ter hold yer food. Now give it to me quick.\"  \"I won't,\" said Jeanne determinedly clinging to the basket, for she had put her purse there after buying some fruit. \"If you touch this basket I'll scream and the people will know what you are doing.\"  \"Pooh! I'll tell them that you are my crazy sister that I'm taking to an asylum,\" said the fellow easily. \"Now you'd better give me that money.\"  \"People would know that I was not your sister,\" exclaimed the girl scornfully. \"You don't look in the least like my brother. Now, sir, go away.\"  \"Not without that money. Sit down,\" he commanded gruffly as the girl half rose from her seat.  Jeanne cast a wild, imploring look about her for help and sank back in her seat despairingly, for the passengers seemed intent upon other concerns, and the noise of the train prevented the conversation from being overheard.  \"Are you going to hand out that money?\"  \"Ye-es,\" faltered Jeanne, reaching for her purse.  \"What do you mean by frightening this girl?\" demanded a voice, and a hand was laid upon the ruffian's shoulder. \"Get out of my seat, you rascal, or I'll have you thrown off the car.\"  A cry of delight escaped Jeanne's lips as she saw that the man who had come to her assistance was the old gentleman who had bought the handkerchiefs from her during the fair.  \"I--I did not mean any harm,\" stammered the fellow, resigning the seat with alacrity. \"I was jest trying ter scare the girl a little.\"  \"Well, let me catch you 'jest trying ter scare her,' any more, and it will be the worse for you,\" cried the old gentleman threateningly. \"Now clear out, and let me see no more of you.\"  The fellow slunk off and her friend in need took the seat by Jeanne's side.  \"That fellow was annoying you terribly, was he not?\"  \"Yes, sir; I was very much frightened, especially when he demanded my money.\"  \"What! Did he do that? Why the scamp! This is worse than I thought. I'll get the conductor after him.\"  \"Oh, let him go,\" pleaded Jeanne, who was quite a little upset by the episode. \"Please stay with me.\"  \"Very well.\" The old man saw her nervousness and acquiesced willingly. \"He can't get off the train so long as this rate of speed is kept up, and I'll see about getting him later. Now tell me all about it.\"  Jeanne gave him a succinct account of what the man had said and done. \"And I was so glad when you came up as you did,\" she said in finishing. \"But I did not expect to see you here, sir, and I thank you so much for your assistance.\"  \"Tut, tut! It is every American's duty to look after women folks when they travel alone. I had just come from the smoker and saw as I entered the door that something was wrong. As the ruffian had my seat I came up at once and demanded it of him. But you are not more surprised to see me than I was to recognize the little patriot of the handkerchiefs. Aren't you a long way from home?\"  \"Yes, sir; I am, but I am going to visit my Uncle Ben in New Orleans.\"  \"Rather a troublesome time for a visit,\" remarked the other musingly. Then as a deep flush suffused the girl's cheek, he added keenly, \"I know that there are sometimes reasons why visits should be made even though the times be perilous. There! I am not going to ask any questions, so don't look at me like that. My name is Emanuel Huntsworth, and I live near Corinth, Mississippi. I was formerly a New Englander but settled in the South a number of years ago. My Union sentiments having made me obnoxious to my neighbors I feared for the safety of my family and am returning from moving them North. I am going back now to wind up my business, when I shall go North once more to do what I can for the government. If you have no friends with you, perhaps you have no objections to my company as far as our ways lie together.\"  \"I should be pleased to be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32993"],["title","A Daughter of the Union (#5)"],["body","you,\" said Jeanne sweetly. \"I am all alone, Mr. Huntsworth. My name is Jeanne Vance, and I live in New York City. I was all right until I got on this train, but now I can't help but be a little uneasy since that man acted so.\"  \"The rascal! I had forgotten him. Conductor,\" as that individual came by. \"I think there is a man on this train that will bear watching.\" Thereupon he related the incident to the official.  \"I will look after the fellow,\" said the conductor.  But search failed to reveal the presence of the man on the train and soon Mr. Huntsworth and Jeanne were convinced that, fearing the consequences of his actions, he had jumped from the train.     CHAPTER V  CASTING BREAD UPON THE WATERS   \"You must be very tired,\" remarked Mr. Huntsworth, as the train drew in at the Memphis station. \"It has been a long hard trip, and if you'll take my advice you will stay here for a day or two before trying to go farther on your journey.\"  \"Oh, I must not,\" exclaimed Jeanne quickly. \"I must get to New Orleans just as soon as I can. It is very necessary.\"  \"Necessary, eh?\" The old gentleman regarded her with a quizzical expression on his face. \"Why should you be so anxious to see your uncle? You must be very fond of him. Have you visited him often?\"  \"No, sir,\" answered Jeanne in some confusion. \"I never saw him in my life. He went to New Orleans and engaged in business there long before I was born. Father hasn't heard from him for a number of years.\"  \"Then isn't it rather queer for your father to choose such a time as this for you to pay him a visit?\" queried Mr. Huntsworth keenly. \"Now don't be alarmed, child,\" he added hastily as Jeanne looked up in a startled manner while the color mounted to cheek and brow. \"I do not wish you to tell me any of your secrets if you have any. I presume that there are just and sufficient reasons for you to go or you would not be going. I merely wished to show you that over anxiety to reach your destination might subject you to suspicion. Also tell no one else that you have never seen your uncle. If you do, others beside myself will wonder why you have been sent to him at a time like this. You don't mind my telling you this, little girl, do you?\"  \"No, indeed,\" returned Jeanne warmly. \"I am very glad that you did so. Father says that one way to learn things is to listen to older people. But I will be truly glad to see Uncle Ben. Father has told me so much about him. He was his favorite brother, and my brother, Dick, is named for him and for father too. Richard Benjamin Vance.\"  Mr. Huntsworth's eyes twinkled, and he gave a low chuckle of appreciation.  \"My dear,\" said he, \"just answer every one who asks you questions in the way you have me, and you'll come out all right. Of course you would want to see your uncle under those circumstances.\" Again he chuckled and looked at her approvingly. \"She knows that I am her friend,\" he mused, \"yet she will not tell me why she is sent down here. That there is some reason for it I am convinced. A very remarkable girl!\" Aloud he continued, \"Here we are at Memphis, child. What shall you do now?\"  \"It is so near night that I guess that I'd better go to a hotel,\" said Jeanne. \"That is what father always does first. Then to-morrow morning I want to find Commodore Porter. I have a letter for him.\"  \"Porter is down the river with Farragut. I doubt if you will be able to find him. But we'll see in the morning. The thing to do is to get a good night's rest after this journey. Here is a cab for the Gayoso House. I always stop there. It is a good place, and overlooks the river. Have you ever seen the Mississippi before?\"  \"No,\" answered Jeanne trying to look about in the gathering darkness. \"It's a great river, isn't it?\"  \"None greater,\" answered Mr. Huntsworth enthusiastically. \"Whichever side of this struggle holds it will be the winning side. It is the backbone of the rebellion, and the key to the whole situation.\"  \"But we hold it, sir,\" said Jeanne earnestly. \"My father says that now that Vicksburg is taken it will not be long before Richmond will fall and then the rebellion will be over.\"  \"Pray God that your father may be right,\" said Mr. Huntsworth. \"But I fear that he is mistaken. These Southerners are not so easily whipped. Every inch of the Confederacy will have to be conquered before they will acknowledge themselves beaten. The North makes the same mistake as the South does. Each forgets that both are of the same Anglo-Saxon blood that never knows defeat. I fear the struggle will be a long and bloody one, all the more bitter for being waged between brothers.\"  \"I hope that it will not be long,\" sighed Jeanne. \"I shouldn't like for Dick to have to be away much longer.\"  \"Is your brother in the army, my dear?\"  \"Yes, sir. Father works for the government, mother belongs to The Woman's Central Relief Association, and I make socks and hem handkerchiefs for the soldiers, and----\" she paused suddenly, conscious that she was about to speak of the object of her journey.  \"And you hold fairs to tempt the shekels from the unwary, eh?\" completed Mr. Huntsworth. \"Well, you are certainly a patriotic family. This is the Gayoso House, child. It has been the resort of all the noted Southerners. It is too dark for you to see the river, but you can hear its murmurings.\"  Jeanne leaned forward eagerly. The soft lapping of the water, as it beat against the foot of the bluff upon which the city stood, came gently to her ears.  \"I wish I could see it,\" she exclaimed.  \"You can in the morning. Meantime, let's get some supper. Here, boy,\" to a porter, \"don't you see that we are waiting to be shown to the dining-room?\"  \"Yes, sah. Right dis way, sah,\" responded the negro, his ivories relaxing into a broad grin. \"Glad ter see yer back, sah. We all's mighty sorry ter heah dat you is gwine ter go norf, sah.\"  \"Who told you that I was going North, you black rascal?\" demanded Mr. Huntsworth. \"I've been North. Have just gotten back. Here, take this, and tell that waiter to hurry up with that supper.\"  \"Yes, sah. Thank ye, sah,\" answered the black pocketing the shinplaster slipped into his hand, with alacrity.  \"I think I never saw so many negroes before,\" remarked Jeanne, looking about the dining-room. \"Where do they all come from?\"  \"You'll see a great many more before you go back to New York,\" responded Mr. Huntsworth. \"The South literally teems with them. If the race only knew its power it would not leave its battles to be fought by the North. A while ago I said the Mississippi was the key to the rebellion. I was mistaken. It is dar-key.\"  Jeanne laughed merrily.  \"My dear child, did you see the point?\" cried the old gentleman delightedly. \"That is indeed an accomplishment! Now my daughter, Anne, is a good girl. An excellent girl, but she not only cannot make a pun, but neither can she see one when it is made. I have a little weakness that way myself.\"  \"We used to, Dick, father and I, to make them at home. But we did it so much that mother stopped us. She said that it wasn't refined--I am sure that I beg your pardon,\" she broke off in great distress.  \"There! Don't take it so to heart,\" laughed Mr. Huntsworth good-naturedly. \"I know that it isn't just the thing to pun, but      \"'A little nonsense now and then     Is relished by the best of men.'  \"Then, too, we have the example of the immortal Shakespeare. But I won't indulge again before you, my dear.\"  \"Oh, but I like them,\" cried Jeanne. \"I think mother stopped us because we did nothing else for a time. But she used to laugh at some of them herself. She did, truly.\"  \"Well, well, of course if you enjoy them that is another thing. Perhaps you can tell when a boy is not a boy.\"  \"I can beat any sort of a drum but a conundrum,\" was Jeanne's quick reply.  \"My, my, but I shall have to look to my laurels,\" exclaimed Mr. Huntsworth in mock alarm. \"That was very bright.\"  \"It's Dick's,\" confessed Jeanne blushing. \"He is so clever. He could always think of something good to say.\"  \"You think a great deal of Dick, don't you?\"  \"Yes, sir; we are very proud of him. And his Colonel has complimented him twice for bravery,\" and Jeanne's eyes lighted up with pride. \"He went at the first call for troops. I'll never forget the day he asked father if he might go. 'It's our country's need, father,' he said, standing there so brave and handsome. 'No Vance has ever turned a deaf ear to that, sir.' And father said, 'My son, if you feel it your duty, go, and God be with you.' O, you should see Dick, sir,\" she continued, enthusiastically. \"There is no one quite like him.\"  \"Perhaps I may some day. I should like to very much. I do not wonder at his bravery since every one of you are so devoted to the cause. Now, my little girl, you had best retire. I am sure that you must be tired.\"  Jeanne rose instantly and, bidding him good-night, was shown to her room. She was up bright and early the next morning, and, dressing quickly ran down the stairs and out on the gallery eager to take a look at the city.  The Gayoso House fronted upon a wide esplanade which extended along the bluff in front of the town. Blocks of large warehouses and public buildings bordered the esplanade on the same side as the hotel. The city was beautifully situated on the Mississippi River just below the mouth of the Wolf River, and located upon what was known as the fourth Chickasaw Bluff, an elevation about forty feet high.  Below the bluff ran the river, and far to the right was what had been a naval depot established by the United States but used until the recent capitulation of Memphis by the Confederates for the purpose of building vessels of their own. To Jeanne, accustomed to New York City, Memphis seemed very small indeed. It was in reality a place of about twelve thousand inhabitants and considered a flourishing little city, being the port of entry for Shelby County, Tennessee. At one time it was the most important town on the river between St. Louis and New"]]]
