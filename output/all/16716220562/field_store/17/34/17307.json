Description  Fin whales have been reported to reach 79 feet (24 m). Females are slightly larger than males of the same age.  The back is distinctly ridged towards the tail, prompting the common name \"razorback\" whale.  The rostrum is narrower and more V-shaped than that of the blue whale and has the same sort of single distinctive head ridge. The top of the head is flat, though slightly less than that of the blue whale.  The dorsal fin is up to 24 inches (61 cm) tall; angled less than 40° on the forward margin, located slightly more than one-third forward from the tail, and appears on the surface shortly after the blow.  All individuals are dark gray to brownish black on the back and sides with none of the mottling present on blue whales and are rarely as heavily scarred as sei whales. Along the back, just behind the head, there is a grayish-white chevron, with the apex along the midline of the back and the arms of the chevron oriented posteriorly, which is sometimes distinctive and may be visible as the animals surface to breathe. The undersides, including the undersides of the flukes and flippers, are white. On the head, the dark coloration is markedly asymmetrical, reaching farther down on the left than on the right side. The right lower lip, including the mouth cavity, and the right front baleen (approximately one-fifth to one-third) are yellowish white. Occasionally the right upper lip is also white. The remainder of the plates on the right side and all those on the left side are striped with alternate bands of yellowish white and bluish gray. The fringes of the plates are brownish gray to grayish white.   Natural History Notes  Fin whales are one of the most common baleen whale species in the world and constitute a major portion of the whaling catch. They are reportedly one of the fastest of the big whales (sei whales may be slightly faster) possibly reaching burst speeds in excess of 20 knots, and were not an important commercial species until the comparatively recent development of fast catcher boats and the depletion of blue whale stocks.  A fin whale's blow can be from 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 m) tall and has been described as an inverted cone or an elongated ellipse.  Fin whales dive to at least 755 feet (230.1 m). This depth is probably deeper than that of either blue or sei whales, a factor usually reflected in differences among the surfacing, blowing, and diving characteristics of these three species. When they are moving leisurely at the surface, fin whales expose the dorsal fin shortly after the appearance of the blowholes, slightly later than that of the sei whales. When they are surfacing from a deeper dive, however, they surface at a steeper angle, blow, submerge the blowholes, and then arch the back and dorsal fin high into the air before beginning another long dive. In this species it can be generally stated that the maximum amount of the back in the area of the dorsal fin which is exposed above the surface as the animal sounds is approximately 2 times the height of the dorsal fin. Fin whales do not show their tail flukes when beginning a dive.  Unlike blue or sei whales, fin whales do breach on occasion. When they do leap clear of the water, fin whales usually reenter with a resounding splash, like that made by humpback and right whales and not smoothly, head first, as minke whales often do.  Fin whales are sometimes found singly or in pairs but more often occur in pods of six or seven individuals and many pods consisting of as many as 50 animals may be concentrated in a small area.  Fin whales calve and breed in winter, mostly in temperate waters.  Atlantic fin whales eat a wide variety of foods, including krill, capelin, squid, herring, and lanternfish.   May Be Confused With  Fin whales may be confused with blue whales, sei whales, and, in the southernmost portion of their range, with Bryde's whales. They may be distinguished from the blue whales by differences in overall coloration, coloration and shape of the head, and the size, position, and time of appearance of the dorsal fin at the surface (see p. 19). After close examination they may be distinguished from Bryde's whales by the presence of three ridges along the head (of the Bryde's whale) and by the smaller, more sharply pointed falcate dorsal fin of the Bryde's whale (see Fig. 31). They may be distinguished from sei whales in the following similar ways:            FIN WHALE                           SEI WHALE                                DORSAL FIN    Slightly falcate, forms angle       Sharply pointed and falcate:   of less than 40° with back          forms angle of greater than   slightly more than one-third        40° with back well more than   forward from tail.                  one-third forward from tail.

Distribution  Fin whales are probably the most numerous and widely distributed large whale species in the western North Atlantic.  Fin whales summer from below the latitude of Cape Cod, Mass., north to the Arctic Circle. (They are frequently seen between New York and Bermuda this time of year.) Within this zone they may sometimes be seen very close to shore and appear to be concentrated between shore and the 1,000-fathom curve from at least lat. 41°20' to 57°00' N. In recent years they have been reported in relatively large numbers in the Gulf of Maine from March through June, off Newfoundland as early as June but increasing to August, and entering Davis Straits and beyond in substantial numbers in midsummer to late summer. There is some evidence that the animals venturing farthest north are the largest individuals of the species. Movements of the population(s) southward have usually begun by October, though some fin whales sometimes remain in the northern seas sufficiently long to become trapped in the ice and killed.

In going over the collection of birds obtained, the attention of the writer was arrested by certain peculiarities evident in the Mountain Chickadees. Comparison with series from the Sierras showed the Inyo birds to be paler colored and longer tailed; and in order to appraise these differences in taxonomic terms it became necessary to assemble material representative of the entire range of the species, in so far as possible. The results of the study thus undertaken are presented herewith.  The material involved in the inquiry has amounted to 464 skins of the Mountain Chickadee, derived from the following sources other than the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology: United States National Museum, through Dr. Charles W. Richmond; United States Biological Survey, through Mr. Edward W. Nelson; and the private collections of Messrs. Edward R. Warren, Joseph and John W. Mailliard, G. Frean Morcom, Harry S. Swarth, and J. Grinnell.  As of general interest, and in the nature of an introduction to the systematic analysis to follow, it may be stated that _Penthestes gambeli_ including its subspecies is throughout its range non-migratory, save as a few individuals in pairs or small companies occasionally descend in fall or early winter to lower levels closely adjacent to their mountain habitats. The range of the species roughly extends from and includes the Rocky Mountains to or nearly to the Pacific Coast, and from Alberta and British Columbia south nearly to the Mexican line--somewhat south of it in northern Lower California. Within this general area the Mountain Chickadee is by no means uniformly distributed. [Page 506] Especially towards the south is its range very \"spotty,\" the representations on detached mountain tops being wholly isolated. Two main areas of relatively continuous distribution are, however, perceivable--the Rocky Mountain area, and the Sierra Nevada area.       [Illustration: Fig. 1. Map showing distribution of the races of          the Mountain Chickadee in California.]   Close scrutiny of the series of specimens at hand well representing the entire Rocky Mountain area reveals no variation in phylogenetic characters from the northernmost to the southernmost stations. All show in apparently equal degree the long tail and cinnamon tinge of sides and back, these features together constituting the grounds for separate subspecific recognition of a Rocky Mountain form. On the other hand, the Sierra Nevadan center, with its own recognizable race, [Page 507] of relatively short tail, proves to have two outlying divergent forms. These three forms are alike in their lack of any cinnamon tinge, this being replaced in two of them by a buffy tinge and in one form by leaden gray. The tail in one of the outlying forms is long, in the other short. The habitats concerned are, respectively, the desert mountains of the Inyo region of eastern California, and the coastal mountains of southern California. This differentiation within the Pacific district, particularly within the state of California, will be better understood in its geographic bearing by reference to the accompanying map (fig. 1).  The behavior of the tail of _Penthestes gambeli_--long in the Rocky Mountain district, short in the Pacific district (see figs. 2, 3)--is paralleled in the _Penthestes atricapillus_ group of chickadees across the North American continent in about the latitude of the state of Washington. In the northern Rocky Mountains occurs the race _P. a. septentrionalis_, with long tail; in the Pacific Coast strip of Washington and Oregon occurs the race _P. a. occidentalis_, with, among other characters, relatively short tail. Other parallels are to be found in the genera _Psaltriparus_, _Thryomanes_ and _Pipilo_.      [Illustration: Fig. 2. Tail of _Penthestes gambeli gambeli_         (no. 27784, Mus. Vert. Zool.; [Male], full-grown juv.;         Sierra Ancha, Gila Co., Arizona; June 26, 1917).  × 1.00.]      [Illustration: Fig. 3. Tail of _Penthestes gambeli abbreviatus_         (no. 24059, Mus. Vert. Zool.; [Male], full-grown juv.; Yolla         Bolly Mt., Tehama Co., California; August 5, 1913). × 1.00.]  It is improbable that the fact of subspecific differentiation in _Penthestes gambeli_ has been altogether overlooked previous to the present time. A premonition of the geographic variation now formally pointed out is to be found in the early writings of Baird (1858, p. 394), who remarked that \"a specimen, apparently of this species [_Parus montanus_], from Medicine Bow creek [Wyoming], (5643,) though marked female, is larger than those from California, as shown by the measurements.\" Also, some of the differences in proportions in the subspecies now recognized are shown in the table of measurements given by Ridgway (1904, p. 409).  For a detailed description of the Mountain Chickadee as a _species_, the reader is referred to Ridgway (1904, p. 408).     =Penthestes gambeli gambeli= (Ridgway)  Rocky Mountain Chickadee       _Parus montanus_ Gambel (1843, p. 259); and of authors, part.

The flanks, sides of body and back in this form are pervaded with a distinct tinge of cinnamon--more exactly, the \"pinkish buff\" of Ridgway (1912, pl. 29). In addition, this race shows the greatest length of tail, and slenderest bill.  _Measurements._--Average of 14 males: Wing, 70.5 mm.; tail, 70.2; exposed culmen, 8.6; depth of bill at base, 3.8. For extremes, see accompanying table.  _Note._--In this paper the length of wing is the usual chord of the folded wing as dried at the side of the body in the conventional study skin. The tail length, however, is measured from the _base_ of the uropygium to the tip of the longest pair of rectrices. It is found that in preparing specimens there is a practically uniform place for cutting off from the body the uropygium with attached feathers, and this is exactly where the tail bends back at an angle to the body in the fresh bird. The lateral rectrices are rooted evenly with the base of the dried uropygium so that the measurement of tail length thus taken becomes the distance from the extreme proximal ends of the most lateral pair of rectrices to the tips of the central pair--somewhat greater than the length of tail as given by Ridgway (1901, p. xv), the latter being the measurement from the base of the central pair of tail feathers to the tips of same. My reason for adopting this different procedure here is that more accuracy seems possible thereby, at least in the kind of material here dealt with. There is less mussing of the specimen also.  Neither depth of bill nor culmen is a practical index to degree of slenderness of bill. No ordinary method of measurement will suffice to indicate the facts as they are perceived by the eye.  As will be seen by the dates in the tables, as a rule only unworn specimens have been selected for measurement.  _Range._--The Rocky Mountain region of North.
