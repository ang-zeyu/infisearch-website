Love is credulous.  Procris, at the sudden shock, fainted away.  Presently recovering, she said, \"It cannot be true; I will not believe it unless I myself am a witness to it.\"  So she waited, with anxious heart, till the next morning, when Cephalus went to hunt as usual.  Then she stole out after him, and concealed herself in the place where the informer directed her.  Cephalus came as he was wont when tired with sport, and stretched himself on the green bank, saying, \"Come, sweet breeze, come and fan me; you know how I love you!  You make the groves and my solitary rambles delightful.\"  He was running on in this way when he heard, or thought he heard, a sound as of a sob in the bushes.  Supposing it some wild animal, he threw hie javelin at the spot.  A cry from his beloved Procris told him that the weapon had too surely met its mark.  He rushed to the place, and found her bleeding and with sinking strength endeavoring to draw forth from the wound the javelin, her own gift.  Cephalus raised her from the earth, strove to stanch the blood, and called her to revive and not to leave him miserable, to reproach himself with her death.  She opened her feeble eyes, and forced herself to utter these few words: \"I implore you, if you have ever loved me, if I have ever deserved kindness at your hands, my husband, grant me this last request; do not marry that odious Breeze!\"  This disclosed the whole mystery; but alas! What advantage to disclose it now?  She died; but her face wore a calm expression, and she looked pityingly and forgivingly on her husband when he made her understand the truth.  In Shakespeare's play just quoted, there is an allusion to Cephalus and Procris, although rather badly spelt.    Pyramus says, \"Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\"   Thisbe.  \"As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\"  Moore, in his Legendary Ballads, has one on Cephalus and Procris, beginning thus:--    \"A hunter once in a grove reclined,   To shun the noon's bright eye,   And oft he wooed the wandering wind   To cool his brow with its sigh.   While mute lay even the wild bee's hum,   Nor breath could stir the aspen's hair,   His song was still, 'Sweet Air, O come!'   While Echo answered, 'Come, sweet Air!'\"    Chapter III  Io and Callisto. Diana and Actaeon. The Story of Phaeton  Jupiter and Juno, although husband and wife, did not live together very happily.  Jupiter did not love his wife very much, and Juno distrusted her husband, and was always accusing him of unfaithfulness.  One day she perceived that it suddenly grew dark, and immediately suspected that her husband had raised a cloud to hide some of his doings that would not bear the light. She brushed away the cloud, and saw her husband, on the banks of a glassy river, with a beautiful heifer standing near him.  Juno suspected that the heifer's form concealed some fair nymph of mortal mould.  This was indeed the case; for it was Io, the daughter of the river god Inachus, whom Jupiter had been flirting with, and, when he became aware of the approach of his wife, had changed into that form.  Juno joined her husband, and noticing the heifer, praised its beauty, and asked whose it was, and of what herd.  Jupiter, to stop questions, replied that it was a fresh creation from the earth.  Juno asked to have it as a gift.  What could Jupiter do? He was loth to give his mistress to his wife; yet how refuse so trifling a present as a simple heifer?  He could not, without arousing suspicion; so he consented.  The goddess was not yet relieved of her suspicions; and she delivered the heifer to Argus, to be strictly watched.  Now Argus had a hundred eyes in his head, and never went to sleep with more than two at a time, so that he kept watch of Io constantly.  He suffered her to feed through the day, and at night tied her up with a vile rope round her neck.  She would have stretched out her arms to implore freedom of Argus, but she had no arms to stretch out, and her voice was a bellow that frightened even herself. She saw her father and her sisters, went near them, and suffered them to pat her back, and heard them admire her beauty.  Her father reached her a tuft o gras, and she licked the outstretched hand.  She longed to make herself known to him, and would have uttered her wish; but, alas!  words were wanting.  At length she bethought herself of writing, and inscribed her name   it was a short one   with her hoof on the sand.  Inachus recognized it, and discovering that his daughter, whom he had long sought in vain, was hidden under this disguise, mourned over her, and, embracing her white neck, exclaimed, \"Alas!  My daughter, it would have been a less grief to have lost you altogether!\"  While he thus lamented, Argus, observing, came and drove her away, and took his seat on a high bank, whence he could see in every direction.  Jupiter was troubled at beholding the sufferings of his mistress, and calling Mercury, told him to go and despatch Argus.  Mercury made haste, put his winged slippers on his feet, and cap on his head, took his sleep-producing wand, and leaped down from the heavenly towers to the earth.  There he laid aside his wings, and kept only his wand, with which he presented himself as a shepherd driving his flock.  As he strolled on he blew upon his pipes. These were what are called the Syrinx or Pandean pipes.  Argus listened with delight, for he had never heard the instrument before.  \"Young man,\" said he, \"come and take a seat by me on this stone.  There is no better place for your flock to graze in than hereabouts, and here is a pleasant shade such as shepherds love.\"  Mercury sat down, talked, and told stories until it grew late, and played upon his pipes his most soothing strains, hoping to lull the watchful eyes to sleep, but all in vain; for Argus still contrived to keep some of his eyes open, though he shut the rest.  Among other stories, Mercury told him how the instrument on which he played was invented.  \"There was a certain nymph, whose name was Syrinx, who was much beloved by the satyrs and spirits of the wood; but she would have none of them, but was a faithful worshipper of Diana, and followed the chase.  You would have thought it was Diana herself, had you seen her in her hunting dress, only that her bow was of horn and Diana's of silver.  One day, as she was returning from the chase, Pan met her, told her just this, and added more of the same sort.  She ran away, without stopping to hear his compliments, and he pursued till she came to the bank of the river, where he overtook her, and she had only time to call for help on her friends, the water nymphs. They heard and consented.  Pan threw his arms around what he supposed to be the form of the nymph, and found he embraced only a tuft of reeds!  As he breathed a sigh, the air sounded through the reeds, and produced a plaintive melody.  The god, charmed with the novelty and with the sweetness of the music, said 'Thus, then, at least, you shall be mine.'  And he took some of the reeds, and placing them together, of unequal lengths, side by side, made an instrument which he called Syrinx, in honor of the nymph.\" Before Mercury had finished his story, he saw Argus's eyes all asleep.  As his head nodded forward on his breast, Mercury with one stroke cut his neck through, and tumbled his head down the rocks.  O hapless Argus!  The light of your hundred eyes is quenched at once!  Juno took them and put them as ornaments on the tail of her peacock, where they remain to this day.  But the vengeance of Juno was not yet satiated.  She sent a gadfly to torment Io, who fled over the whole world from its pursuit.  She swam through the Ionian Sea, which derived its name from her, then roamed over the plains of Illyria, ascended Mount Haemus, and crossed the Thracian strait, thence named the Bosphorus (cow-bearer), rambled on through Scythia and the country of the Cimmerians, and arrived at last on the banks of the Nile.  At length Jupiter interceded for her, and, upon his promising not to pay her any more attentions, Juno consented to restore her to her form.  It was curious to see her gradually recover her former self.  The coarse hairs fell from her body, her horns shrunk up, her eyes grew narrower, her mouth shorter; hands and fingers came instead of hoofs to her forefeet; in fine, there was nothing left of the heifer except her beauty.  At first she was afraid to speak for fear she should low, but gradually she recovered her confidence, and was restored to her father and sisters.  In a poem dedicated to Leigh Hunt, by Keats, the following allusion to the story of Pan and Syrinx occurs:--    \"So did he feel who pulled the boughs aside,   That we might look into a forest wide,   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *   Telling us how fair trembling Syrinx fled   Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.   Poor nymph   poor Pan   how he did weep to find   Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind   Along the reedy stream; a half-heard strain,   Full of sweet desolation, balmy pain.\"   CALLISTO  Callisto was another maiden who excited the jealousy of Juno, and the goddess changed her into a bear.  \"I will take away,\" said she, :\"that beauty with which you have captivated my husband.\" Down fell Callisto on her hands and knees; she tried to stretch out her arms in supplication,-- they were already beginning to be covered with black hair.  Her hands grew rounded, became armed with crooked claws, and served for feet; her mouth, which Jove used to praise for its beauty, became a horrid pair of jaws; her voice, which if unchanged would have moved the heart to pity, became a growl, more fit to inspire terror.  Yet her former disposition remained, and, with continued groaning, she bemoaned her fate, and stood upright as well as she could, lifting up her paws to beg for mercy; and felt that Jove was unkind, though she could not tell him so.  Ah,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],["title","Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#8)"],["body"," often, afraid to stay in the woods all night alone, she wandered about the neighborhood of her former haunts; how often, frightened by the dogs, did she, so lately a huntress, fly in terror from the hunters!  Often she fled from the wild beasts, forgetting that she was now a wild beast herself; and, bear as she was, was afraid of the bears.  One day a youth espied her as he was hunting.  She saw him and recognized him as her own son, now grown a young man.  She stopped, and felt inclined to embrace him.  As she was about to approach, he, alarmed, raised his hunting spear, and was on the point of transfixing her, when Jupiter, beholding, arrested the crime, and, snatching away both of them, placed them in the heavens as the Great and Little Bear.  Juno was in a rage to see her rival so set in honor, and hastened to ancient Tethys and Oceanus, the powers of ocean, and, in answer to their inquiries, thus told the cause of her coming; \"Do you ask why I, the queen of the gods, have left the heavenly plains and sought your depths.  Learn that I am supplanted in heaven,-- my place is given to another.  You will hardly believe me; but look when night darkens the world, and you shall see the two, of whom I have so much reason to complain, exalted to the heavens, in that part where the circle is the smallest, in the neighborhood of the pole.  Why should any one hereafter tremble at the thought of offending Juno, when such rewards are the consequence of my displeasure!  See what I have been able to effect!  I forbade her to wear the human form,-- she is placed among the stars!  So do my punishments result,-- such is the extent of my power!  Better that she should have resumed her former shape, as I permitted Io to do.  Perhaps he means to marry her, and put me away!  But you, my foster parents, if you feel for me, and see with displeasure this unworthy treatment of me, show it, I beseech you, by forbidding this guilty couple from coming into your waters.\"  The powers of the ocean assented, and consequently the two constellations of the Great and Little Bear move round and round in heaven, but never sink, as the other stars do, beneath the ocean.  Milton alludes to the fact that the constellation of the Bear never sets, when he says,    \"Let my lamp at midnight hour   Be seen in some high lonely tower,   Where I may oft outwatch the Bear.\"   Il Penseroso  And Prometheus, in James Russell Lowell's poem, says,  \"One after one the stars have risen and set, Sparkling upon the hoar-frost of my chain; The Bear that prowled all night about the fold Of the North Star, hath shrunk into his den, Scared by the blithsome footsteps of the dawn.\"  The last star in the tail of the Little Bear is the Pole star, called also the Cynosure.  Milton says,    \"Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures   While the landscape round it measures.   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *   Towers and battlements it sees   Bosomed high in tufted trees,   Where perhaps some beauty lies   The Cynosure of neighboring eyes.\"   L'Allegro.  The reference here is both to the Pole-star as the guide of mariners, and to the magnetic attraction of the North.  He calls it also the \"Star of Aready,\" because Callisto's boy was named Arcas, and they lived in Arcadia.  In Milton's Comus, the elder brother, benighted in the woods, says,    \"Some gentle taper!   Through a rush candle, from   the wicker hole   Of some clay habitation,     visit us   With thy long levelled rule     of streaming light,   And thou shalt be our star of Aready,   Or Tyrian Chynsure.\"   DIANA AND ACTAEON  It was midday, and the sun stood equally distant from either goal, when young Actaeon, son of King Cadmus, thus addressed the youths who with him were hunting the stag in the mountains:--  \"Friends, our nets and our weapons are wet with the blood of our victims; we have had sport enough for one day, and tomorrow we can renew our labors.  Now, while Phoebus parches the earth, let us put by our instruments and indulge ourselves with rest.\"  There was a valley thickly enclosed with cypresses and pines, sacred to the huntress-queen, Diana.  In the extremity of the valley was a cave, not adorned with art, but nature had counterfeited art in its construction, for she had turned the arch of its roof with stones as delicately fitted as if by the hand of man.  A fountain burst out from one side, whose open basin was bounded by a grassy rim.  Here the goddess of the woods used to come when weary with hunting and lave her virgin limbs in the sparkling water.  One day, having repaired thither with her nymphs, she handed her javelin, her quiver, and her bow to one, her robe to another, while a third unbound the sandals from her feet.  Then Crocale, the most skilful of them, arranged her hair, and Nephele, Hyale, and the rest drew water in capacious urns.  While the goddess was thus employed in the labors of the toilet, behold, Actaeon, having quitted his companions, and rambling without any especial object, came to the place, led thither by his destiny.  As he presented himself at the entrance of the cave, the nymphs, seeing a man, screamed and rushed towards the goddess to hide her with their bodies.  But she was taller than the rest, and overtopped them all by a head.  Such a color as tinges the clouds at sunset or at dawn came over the countenance of Diana thus taken by surprise.  Surrounded as she was by her nymphs, she yet turned half away, and sought with a sudden impulse for her arrows.  As they were not at hand, she dashed the water into the face of the intruder, adding these words: \"Now go and tell, if you can, that you have seen Diana unapparelled.\"  Immediately a pair of branching stag's horns grew out of his head, his neck gained in length, his ears grew sharp-pointed, his hands became feet, his arms long legs, his body was covered with a hairy spotted hide. Fear took the place of his former boldness, and the hero fled. He could not but admire his own speed; but when he saw his horns in the water, \"Ah, wretched me!: he would have said, but no sound followed the effort.  He groaned, and tears flowed down the face that had taken the place of his own.  Yet his consciousness remained.  What shall he do?   Go home to seek the palace, or lie hid in the woods?  The latter he was afraid, the former he was ashamed, to do.  While he hesitated the dogs saw him.  First Melampus, a Spartan dog, gave the signal with his bark, then Pamphagus, Dorceus, Lelaps, Theron, Nape, Tigris, and all the rest, rushed after him swifter than the wind.  Over rocks and cliffs, through mountain gorges that seemed impracticable, he fled, and they followed.  Where he had often chased the stag and cheered on his pack, his pack now chased him, cheered on by his own huntsmen.  He longed to cry out, \"I am Actaeon; recognize your master!\"  But the words came not at his will.  The air resounded with the bark of the dogs.  Presently one fastened on his back, another seized his shoulder.  While they held their master, the rest of the pack came up and buried their teeth in his flesh.  He groaned,   not in a human voice, yet certainly not in a stag's,   and, falling on his knees, raised his eyes, and would have raised his arms in supplication, if he had had them. His friends and fellow-huntsmen cheered on the dogs, and looked every where for Actaeon, calling on him to join the sport.  At the sound of his name, he turned his head, and heard them regret that he should be away.  He earnestly wished he was.  He would have been well pleased to see the exploits of his dogs, but to feel them was too much.  They were all around him, rending and tearing; and it was not till they had torn his life out that the anger of Diana was satisfied.  In the \"Epic of Hades\" there is a description of Actaeon and his change of form.  Perhaps the most beautiful lines in it are when Actaeon, changed to a stag, first hears his own hounds and flees.    \"But as I gazed, and careless turned and passed   Through the thick wood, forgetting what had been,   And thinking thoughts no longer, swift there came   A mortal terror; voices that I knew.   My own hounds' bayings that I loved before,   As with them often o'er the purple hills   I chased the flying hart from slope to slope,   Before the slow sun climbed the eastern peaks,   Until the swift sun smote the western plain;   Whom often I had cheered by voice and glance,   Whom often I had checked with hand and thong;   Grim followers, like the passions, firing me,   True servants, like the strong nerves, urging me   On many a fruitless chase, to find and take   Some too swift-fleeting beauty, faithful feet   And tongues, obedient always: these I knew   Clothed with a new-born force and vaster grown,   And stronger than their master; and I thought,   What if they tore me with their jaws, nor knew   That once I ruled them,   brute pursuing brute,   And I the quarry?  Then I turned and fled   If it was I indeed that feared and fled   Down the long glades, and through the tangled brakes,   Where scarce the sunlight pierced; fled on and on,   And panted, self-pursued.  But evermore   The dissonant music which I knew so sweet,   When by the windy hills, the echoing vales   And whispering pines it rang; now far, now near   As from my rushing steed I leant and cheered   With voice and horn the chase; this brought to me   Fear of I knew not what, which bade me fly,   Fly always, fly; but when my heart stood still,   And all my limbs were stiffened as I fled,   Just as the white moon ghost-like climbed the sky,   Nearer they came and nearer, baying loud,   With bloodshot eyes and red jaws dripping foam;   And when I strove to check their savagery,   Speaking with words; no voice articulate came,   Only a dumb, low bleat.  Then all the throng   Leapt swift upon me and tore me as I lay,   And left me man again.\"  In Shelley's poem Adonais is the following allusion to the story of Actaeon:--    \"Midst others of less note came "]]]
