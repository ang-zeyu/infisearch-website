So a poor ghost, beside his misty streams,  Is haunted by strange doubts, evasive dreams,    Hints of a pre-Lethean life, of men,  Stars, rocks, and flesh, things unintelligible,    And light on waving grass, he knows not when,  And feet that ran, but where, he cannot tell.   THE PACIFIC, 1914     SONNET (_Suggested by some of the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research_)    Not with vain tears, when we're beyond the sun,    We'll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread    Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead  Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run  Down some close-covered by-way of the air,    Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,    Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find  Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there   Spend in pure converse our eternal day;    Think each in each, immediately wise;  Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say    What this tumultuous body now denies;  And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;    And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.     CLOUDS    Down the blue night the unending columns press    In noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,    Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snow  Up to the white moon's hidden loveliness.  Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,    And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,    As who would pray good for the world, but know  Their benediction empty as they bless.   They say that the Dead die not, but remain    Near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth.      I think they ride the calm mid-heaven, as these,  In wise majestic melancholy train,      And watch the moon, and the still-raging seas,    And men, coming and going on the earth.   THE PACIFIC, _October_ 1913     MUTABILITY    They say there's a high windless world and strange,    Out of the wash of days and temporal tide,    Where Faith and Good, Wisdom and Truth abide,  _Ã†terna corpora_, subject to no change.  There the sure suns of these pale shadows move;    There stand the immortal ensigns of our war;    Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there, a star,  And perishing hearts, imperishable Love....   Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss, smile;    Each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over;    Love has no habitation but the heart.  Poor straws! on the dark flood we catch awhile,    Cling, and are borne into the night apart.    The laugh dies with the lips, 'Love' with the lover.   SOUTH KENSINGTON--MAKAWELI, 1913     OTHER POEMS     THE BUSY HEART    Now that we've done our best and worst, and parted,    I would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend.  (O heart, I do not dare go empty-hearted)    I'll think of Love in books, Love without end;  Women with child, content; and old men sleeping;    And wet strong ploughlands, scarred for certain grain;  And babes that weep, and so forget their weeping;    And the young heavens, forgetful after rain;  And evening hush, broken by homing wings;    And Song's nobility, and Wisdom holy,  That live, we dead. I would think of a thousand things,    Lovely and durable, and taste them slowly,  One after one, like tasting a sweet food.  I have need to busy my heart with quietude.     LOVE    Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,    Where that comes in that shall not go again;  Love sells the proud heart's citadel to Fate.    They have known shame, who love unloved. Even then,  When two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking,    And agony's forgot, and hushed the crying  Of credulous hearts, in heaven--such are but taking    Their own poor dreams within their arms, and lying  Each in his lonely night, each with a ghost.    Some share that night. But they know, love grows colder,  Grows false and dull, that was sweet lies at most.    Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder,  But darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss.  All this is love; and all love is but this.     UNFORTUNATE    Heart, you are restless as a paper scrap    That's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind;    Saying, \"She is most wise, patient and kind.  Between the small hands folded in her lap  Surely a shamed head may bow down at length,    And find forgiveness where the shadows stir  About her lips, and wisdom in her strength,    Peace in her peace. Come to her, come to her!\"...   She will not care. She'll smile to see me come,    So that I think all Heaven in flower to fold me.    She'll give me all I ask, kiss me and hold me,      And open wide upon that holy air  The gates of peace, and take my tiredness home,      Kinder than God. But, heart, she will not care.     THE CHILTERNS    Your hands, my dear, adorable,    Your lips of tenderness  --Oh, I've loved you faithfully and well,    Three years, or a bit less.    It wasn't a success.   Thank God, that's done! and I'll take the road,    Quit of my youth and you,  The Roman road to Wendover    By Tring and Lilley Hoo,    As a free man may do.   For youth goes over, the joys that fly,    The tears that follow fast;  And the dirtiest things we do must lie    Forgotten at the last;    Even Love goes past.   What's left behind I shall not find,    The splendour and the pain;  The splash of sun, the shouting wind,    And the brave sting of rain,    I may not meet again.   But the years, that take the best away,    Give something in the end;  And a better friend than love have they,    For none to mar or mend,    That have themselves to friend.   I shall desire and I shall find    The best of my desires;  The autumn road, the mellow wind    That soothes the darkening shires.    And laughter, and inn-fires.   White mist about the black hedgerows,    The slumbering Midland plain,  The silence where the clover grows,    And the dead leaves in the lane,    Certainly, these remain.   And I shall find some girl perhaps,    And a better one than you,  With eyes as wise, but kindlier,    And lips as soft, but true.    And I daresay she will do.     HOME    I came back late and tired last night    Into my little room,  To the long chair and the firelight    And comfortable gloom.   But as I entered softly in    I saw a woman there,  The line of neck and cheek and chin,    The darkness of her hair,  The form of one I did not know    Sitting in my chair.   I stood a moment fierce and still,    Watching her neck and hair.  I made a step to her; and saw    That there was no one there.   It was some trick of the firelight    That made me see her there.  It was a chance of shade and light    And the cushion in the chair.   Oh, all you happy over the earth,    That night, how could I sleep?  I lay and watched the lonely gloom;    And watched the moonlight creep  From wall to basin, round the room.    All night I could not sleep.     THE NIGHT JOURNEY    Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;    The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.  Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,    Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes   Glares the imperious mystery of the way.    Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train  Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,    Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again....   As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,    Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;  And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,    Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move   Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;    And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,  Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,    Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,   Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,    Out of the fire, out of the little room....  --There is an end appointed, O my soul!    Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom   Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.    Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,  Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.    The white lights roar. The sounds of the world die.   And lips and laughter are forgotten things.    Speed sharpens; grows. Into the night, and on,  The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.    The lamps fade; and the stars. We are alone.     SONG    All suddenly the wind comes soft,    And Spring is here again;  And the hawthorn quickens with buds of green,    And my heart with buds of pain.   My heart all Winter lay so numb,    The earth so dead and frore,  That I never thought the Spring would come,    Or my heart wake any more.   But Winter's broken and earth has woken,    And the small birds cry again;  And the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds,    And my heart puts forth its pain.     BEAUTY AND BEAUTY    When Beauty and Beauty meet    All naked, fair to fair,  The earth is crying-sweet,    And scattering-bright the air,  Eddying, dizzying, closing round,    With soft and drunken laughter;  Veiling all that may befall    After--after--   Where Beauty and Beauty met,    Earth's still a-tremble there,  And winds are scented yet,    And memory-soft the air,  Bosoming, folding glints of light,    And shreds of shadowy laughter;  Not the tears that fill the years    After--after--     THE WAY THAT LOVERS USE    The way that lovers use is this;    They bow, catch hands, with never a word,  And their lips meet, and they do kiss,    --So I have heard.   They queerly find some healing so,    And strange attainment in the touch;  There is a secret lovers know,    --I have read as much.   And theirs no longer joy nor smart,    Changing or ending, night or day;  But mouth to mouth, and heart on heart,    --So lovers say.     MARY AND GABRIEL    Young Mary, loitering once her garden way,  Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day,  As wine that blushes water through. And soon,  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33902"],["title","1914, and Other Poems (#3)"],["body","of the gold air of the afternoon,  One knelt before her: hair he had, or fire,  Bound back above his ears with golden wire,  Baring the eager marble of his face.  Not man's nor woman's was the immortal grace  Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white,  And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light,  Incurious. Calm as his wings, and fair,  That presence filled the garden.                                   She stood there,  Saying, \"What would you, Sir?\"                                 He told his word,  \"Blessed art thou of women!\" Half she heard,  Hands folded and face bowed, half long had known,  The message of that clear and holy tone,  That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart;  Such serene tidings moved such human smart.  Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow.  Her hands crept up her breast. She did but know  It was not hers. She felt a trembling stir  Within her body, a will too strong for her  That held and filled and mastered all. With eyes  Closed, and a thousand soft short broken sighs,  She gave submission; fearful, meek, and glad....    She wished to speak. Under her breasts she had  Such multitudinous burnings, to and fro,  And throbs not understood; she did not know  If they were hurt or joy for her; but only  That she was grown strange to herself, half lonely,  All wonderful, filled full of pains to come  And thoughts she dare not think, swift thoughts and dumb,  Human, and quaint, her own, yet very far,  Divine, dear, terrible, familiar...  Her heart was faint for telling; to relate  Her limbs' sweet treachery, her strange high estate,  Over and over, whispering, half revealing,  Weeping; and so find kindness to her healing.  'Twixt tears and laughter, panic hurrying her,  She raised her eyes to that fair messenger.  He knelt unmoved, immortal; with his eyes  Gazing beyond her, calm to the calm skies;  Radiant, untroubled in his wisdom, kind.  His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind.  How should she, pitiful with mortality,  Try the wide peace of that felicity  With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart,  And hints of human ecstasy, human smart,  And whispers of the lonely weight she bore,  And how her womb within was hers no more  And at length hers?                      Being tired, she bowed her head;  And said, \"So be it!\"                        The great wings were spread  Showering glory on the fields, and fire.  The whole air, singing, bore him up, and higher,  Unswerving, unreluctant. Soon he shone  A gold speck in the gold skies; then was gone.   The air was colder, and grey. She stood alone.     THE FUNERAL OF YOUTH: THRENODY    The day that _Youth_ had died,  There came to his grave-side,  In decent mourning, from the county's ends,  Those scatter'd friends  Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,  And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,  In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,  The days and nights and dawnings of the time  When _Youth_ kept open house,  Nor left untasted  Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,  No quest of his unshar'd--  All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,  Followed their old friend's bier.  _Folly_ went first,  With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd;  And after trod the bearers, hat in hand--  _Laughter_, most hoarse, and Captain _Pride_ with tanned  And martial face all grim, and fussy _Joy_,  Who had to catch a train, and _Lust_, poor, snivelling boy;  These bore the dear departed.  Behind them, broken-hearted,  Came _Grief_, so noisy a widow, that all said,  \"Had he but wed  Her elder sister _Sorrow_, in her stead!\"  And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,  The fatherless children, _Colour_, _Tune_, and _Rhyme_  (The sweet lad _Rhyme_), ran all-uncomprehending.  Then, at the way's sad ending,  Round the raw grave they stay'd. Old _Wisdom_ read,  In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.  There stood _Romance_,  The furrowing tears had mark'd her rougÃ¨d cheek;  Poor old _Conceit_, his wonder unassuaged;  Dead _Innocency's_ daughter, _Ignorance_;  And shabby, ill-dress'd _Generosity_;  And _Argument_, too full of woe to speak;  _Passion_, grown portly, something middle-aged;  And _Friendship_--not a minute older, she;  _Impatience_, ever taking out his watch;  _Faith_, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch  Old _Wisdom's_ endless drone.  _Beauty_ was there,  Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.  Poor maz'd _Imagination_; _Fancy_ wild;  _Ardour_, the sunlight on his greying hair;  _Contentment_, who had known _Youth_ as a child  And never seen him since. And _Spring_ came too,  Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers--  She did not stay for long.  And _Truth_, and _Grace_, and all the merry crew,  The laughing _Winds_ and _Rivers_, and lithe _Hours_;  And _Hope_, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing _Song_;--  Yes, with much woe and mourning general,  At dead _Youth's_ funeral,  Even these were met once more together, all,  Who erst the fair and living _Youth_ did know;  All, except only _Love_. _Love_ had died long ago.     GRANTCHESTER     THE OLD VICARAGE, GRANTCHESTER  (_CafÃ© des Westens, Berlin, May_ 1912)    Just now the lilac is in bloom,  All before my little room;  And in my flower-beds, I think,  Smile the carnation and the pink;  And down the borders, well I know,  The poppy and the pansy blow...  Oh! there the chestnuts, summer through,  Beside the river make for you  A tunnel of green gloom, and sleep  Deeply above; and green and deep  The stream mysterious glides beneath,  Green as a dream and deep as death.  --Oh, damn! I know it! and I know  How the May fields all golden show,  And when the day is young and sweet,  Gild gloriously the bare feet  That run to bathe...                    _Du lieber Gott!_   Here am I, sweating, sick, and hot,  And there the shadowed waters fresh  Lean up to embrace the naked flesh.  _Temperamentvoll_ German Jews  Drink beer around;--and _there_ the dews  Are soft beneath a morn of gold.  Here tulips bloom as they are told;  Unkempt about those hedges blows  An English unofficial rose;  And there the unregulated sun  Slopes down to rest when day is done,  And wakes a vague unpunctual star,  A slippered Hesper; and there are  Meads towards Haslingfield and Coton  Where das _Betreten's_ not _verboten_.   [Greek: eithe genoimÃªn] ... Would I were  In Grantchester, in Grantchester!--  Some, it may be, can get in touch  With Nature there, or Earth, or such.  And clever modern men have seen  A Faun a-peeping through the green,  And felt the Classics were not dead,  To glimpse a Naiad's reedy head,  Or hear the Goat-foot piping low:...  But these are things I do not know.  I only know that you may lie  Day long and watch the Cambridge sky,  And, flower-lulled in sleepy grass,  Hear the cool lapse of hours pass,  Until the centuries blend and blur  In Grantchester, in Grantchester....  Still in the dawnlit waters cool  His ghostly Lordship swims his pool,  And tries the strokes, essays the tricks,  Long learnt on Hellespont, or Styx.  Dan Chaucer hears his river still  Chatter beneath a phantom mill.  Tennyson notes, with studious eye,  How Cambridge waters hurry by...  And in that garden, black and white,  Creep whispers through the grass all night;  And spectral dance, before the dawn,  A hundred Vicars down the lawn;  Curates, long dust, will come and go  On lissom, clerical, printless toe;  And oft between the boughs is seen  The sly shade of a Rural Dean...  Till, at a shiver in the skies,  Vanishing with Satanic cries,  The prim ecclesiastic rout  Leaves but a startled sleeper-out,  Grey heavens, the first bird's drowsy calls,  The falling house that never falls.   God! I will pack, and take a train,  And get me to England once again!  For England's the one land, I know,  Where men with Splendid Hearts may go;  And Cambridgeshire, of all England,  The shire for Men who Understand;  And of _that_ district I prefer  The lovely hamlet Grantchester.  For Cambridge people rarely smile,  Being urban, squat, and packed with guile;  And Royston men in the far South  Are black and fierce and strange of mouth;  At Over they fling oaths at one,  And worse than oaths at Trumpington,  And Ditton girls are mean and dirty,  And there's none in Harston under thirty,  And folks in Shelford and those parts  Have twisted lips and twisted hearts,  And Barton men make Cockney rhymes,  And Coton's full of nameless crimes,  And things are done you'd not believe  At Madingley, on Christmas Eve.  Strong men have run for miles and miles,  When one from Cherry Hinton smiles;  Strong men have blanched, and shot their wives,  Rather than send them to St. Ives;  Strong men have cried like babes, bydam,  To hear what happened at Babraham.  But Grantchester! ah, Grantchester!  There's peace and holy quiet there,  Great clouds along pacific skies,  And men and women with straight eyes,  Lithe children lovelier than a dream,  A bosky wood, a slumbrous stream,  And little kindly winds that creep  Round twilight corners, half asleep.  In Grantchester their skins are white;  They bathe by day, they bathe by night;  The women there do all they ought;  The men observe the Rules of Thought.  They love the Good; they worship Truth;  They laugh uproariously in youth;  (And when they get to feeling old,  They up and shoot themselves, I'm told)...     Ah God! to see the branches stir  Across the moon at Grantchester!  To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten  Unforgettable, unforgotten  River-smell, and hear the breeze  Sobbing in the little trees.  Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand  Still guardians of that holy land?  The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream,  The yet unacademic stream?  Is dawn a secret shy and cold  Anadyomene, silver-gold?  And sunset still a golden sea  From Haslingfield to Madingley?  And after, ere the night is born,  Do hares come out about the corn?  Oh, is the water sweet and cool,  Gentle and brown, above the pool?  And laughs the"]]]
