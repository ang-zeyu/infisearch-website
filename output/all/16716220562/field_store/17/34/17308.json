Vert. Zool.; October 7, 1917; collected by J. Grinnell, orig. no. 4588.  _Diagnosis._--The palest colored race of the four; sides, flanks and back, in unworn plumage, pervaded with pale buff--the \"cartridge buff\" of Ridgway (1912, pl. 30). Wear or fading, or both, removes most of this buff tone, so that the resulting effect, in spring and summer birds, is of an ashy tone of coloration, distinctly lighter than in any of the other three subspecies, in same stage. It seems probable that there is a paler tone to the underlying plumage parts and that this becomes revealed by loss of the superficial pigment-bearing portions through the gradual progress of feather abrasion. _Inyoensis_ shows nearly as long a tail as does _gambeli_. Its bill is somewhat smaller.  _Measurements._--Average of 10 males: \"Wing, 71.1 mm.; tail, 69.3; exposed culmen, 8.1; depth of bill at base, 3.7. For extremes, see accompanying table.  _Range._--The higher mountains of eastern California lying east and southeast of Owens Valley, from the vicinity of the Mono Craters and the White Mountains, in Mono County, south to the Panamint Mountains, in Inyo County. _Specimens examined_, 50, from the following localities, all in California:  Mono County: Mono Mills, 1; near Benton, 2; near Big Prospector Meadow, 10,000-10,500 ft., White Mts., 15; Cottonwood Creek, 9200 ft., White Mts., 1.

O.), Siskiyou County, California. _Type_, male, no. 119 (orig. no., in coll. J. Grinnell); December 12, 1901; collected by Malcolm P. Anderson.  _Diagnosis._--Tone of color on sides, flanks and back the same as in _inyoensis_, though not quite so pale, namely, in fresh plumage, cartridge buff. Tail (see figs. 2, 3) much shorter than in either _gambeli_ or _inyoensis_; and bill averaging smaller than in any of the other three races.  _Measurements._--Average of 14 males: Wing, 69.7 mm.; tail, 65.0; exposed culmen, 7.9; depth of bill at base, 3.8. For extremes, see accompanying table.  _Range._--The higher mountains of central and northern California, southern Oregon (probably this subspecies), and northwestern[** sic] Nevada. Occurs west in northern California through the Siskiyou and Salmon mountains and to South Yolla Bolly Mountain and Mount Sanhedrin; and south in the Sierra Nevada to the vicinity of Mount Whitney. _Specimens examined_, 182, from the following localities:  California: Modoc County: Sugar Hill, 4; Warner Mts., 27.

Type in coll. J. Grinnell.  _Diagnosis._--Tone of coloration on sides, flanks and back distinctly plumbeous--more exactly, on sides and flanks the \"smoke gray\" of Ridgway (1912, pl. 46), and on back near the \"mouse gray\" of the same authority (pl. 51). The tail in this race is short as in _abbrevialus_, but the bill is long and heavy, averaging thicker through than in any of the other three races.  _Measurements._--Average of 14 males: Wing, 70.0 mm.; tail, 65.4; exposed culmen, 8.5; depth of bill at base, 4.1. For extremes, see accompanying table.  _Range._--Higher mountains of southern California, from the extreme southern Sierra Nevada in Tulare County, and the Santa Lucia Mountains in Monterey County, south to the Cuyamaca Mountains, San Diego County; also (probably this subspecies) in the San Pedro Martir Mountains, in northern Lower California. _Specimens examined_, 160, from the following localities, all in California:  Monterey County: Headwaters of Big Creek, 2.

Orange County: Santa Ana Mts., 3000 ft., 1 (vagrant?). San Diego County: Julian, 1; Cuyamaca Mts., 6.  _General remarks._--In making use of the intrinsic color characters, which are important here in distinguishing subspecies, it is, of course, essential that the effects of extraneous factors be taken into account. Prolonged wear and fading evidently serve to weaken the intensity of the color tones, more especially the buffy ones. Then, too, chickadees seem peculiarly susceptible to discoloration by smoke, soot and charred wood; for example, our series from Cisco and Blue Cañon, stations along the Central Pacific Railway over the Sierra Nevada, even though taken in September and October almost immediately after completion of the fall molt, are obviously more or less begrimed with soot. On the other hand, the autumn- and winter-taken series from the Yosemite region and from the Siskiyou Mountains are clean, and show their intrinsic color tones to good advantage.  Intergradation undoubtedly connects the four races of the Mountain Chickadee into a continuous series of forms. Abundant material at hand from that portion of the Sierra Nevada immediately south of Mount Whitney shows complete transition from _Penthestes gambeli baileyae_ to _P. g. abbreviatus_; in fact, many of the specimens can only be placed arbitrarily in one category or the other. Several examples from the vicinity of Mono Lake, in Mono County, California, and from along the west flank of the Sierras in Inyo County, insensibly bridge the interval between _P. g. abbreviatus_ and _P. g. inyoensis_, especially when considered in connection with the individual variation to which each race is subject in about normal degree.  Material at hand from different parts of the Great Basin is unsatisfactory either in that it is scanty or because of the worn state of the plumage. A summer-taken series of 13 Mountain Chickadees (nos. 8952-8964, Mus. Vert. Zool.) from the Pine Forest Mountains, Humboldt County, Nevada, shows in color no approach to _P. gambeli gambeli_. In this respect it is like _P. g. inyoensis_, but the tail averages nearly as short as in _P. g. abbreviatus_. Taking all features into account it seems best placed under _abbreviatus_. Fresh-plumaged fall specimens from this locality would make determination more certain.  A specimen ([Male], no. 547, Mus. Vert. Zool.) from Anthony, Baker County, Oregon, taken October 16, 1907, might be referred to _P. g. abbreviatus_; but the tone of color of back and sides is much darker than usual in that form. It is certainly much darker than in _P. g. inyoensis_. Its tail is but 65.3 mm. long. A skin ([Female], no. 18, Morcom coll.) from Camp Harney, Harney County, Oregon, February 17, 1875, has a tail length of 67.7 mm., and in depth of color is about intermediate between _abbreviatus_ and _P. g. gambeli_. A specimen ([Female], no. 136639, U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv. coll.) from Fort Spokane, Lincoln County, Washington, September 28, 1890, is almost identical with _gambeli_ in coloration; but it, too, has a short tail, only 64.4 mm. long, though there is chance of error here, as several of the rectrices are missing. The writer prefers to leave these last three examples for the time being unplaced.  It is clear that intergradation between _Penthestes gambeli gambeli_ and any one of the other three subspecies is less well established than between any two of these other three. But sufficiency of material from the proper localities through eastern Oregon and eastern Washington would likely prove its"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33531"],["title","The Subspecies of the Mountain Chickadee (#2)"],["body","as is the case between the California forms.
