The inscriptions within the chapter ring are not utilized for chronograms, however. It is apparent that Father Borghesi was required to make a most careful selection of the texts for his inscriptions in order that none of the phrases included any additional letters which formed Roman numerals than would total to the date he desired to indicate, namely, 1764. Where it was necessary, he employed an asterisk to separate parts of texts so that each would produce the same total. Any letter that did not form a Roman numeral, even if capitalized or used in a larger size, did not interfere with the formation of the chronograms.  In spite of his ingenuity in designing a text which would include only such of the letters representing the Roman numerals which would provide the chronograms for 1764, Father Borghesi experienced some difficulties, particularly in place names. He accordingly changed them in order to avoid the inclusion of letters that would have disturbed his totals. Examples are MEGGL instead of MECHL, which had an extra C, and RVNNO instead of RVMO, which had an extra M.   PUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND CLOCK  When the clock had been completed and proved to work successfully, Borghesi once more reduced a description of the clock and its function to published form in a second little volume published by Monauni. This second work was also in Latin, the title of which is translated as _The Most Recent Theoretical-Practical Astronomical Clock According to the Equally Most Recent System of the World_. As with his first book, Father Borghesi devoted a number of pages to a preface addressed to the reader, which is translated from the Latin:       This mechanical instrument was far from being ready for public      notice. A great deal of time and work remained to produce a      machine of this new system from the very foundations; then, by      a most accurate calculation to bring the motions of many wheels      up-to-date with the most recent astronomical observations; and,      finally, to fashion it with the craftsman's file, often enough      with a weary hand. All this work I had performed eagerly, so      that, while in my room, I might contemplate leisurely, both day      and night, the true face of the heavens and the seas unobscured      by clouds, even though I had no astronomical equipment. But,      then I remembered that, in my book on the first clock, I had      promised a description of a new (at least, as far as is known      to me) clock. Moreover, friends with astronomical interest, who      took part in the oft-repeated astronomical experiments      concerning this clock, persuaded me that the intellectual world      would enjoy having a greater knowledge and a description of      this work. However, it was not only the promises nor the      desires of many which moved me to write this work, but I also      thought it was necessary to set forth, before the description      of the clock, an exposition of the astronomical system      according to which this clock was constructed, so that the      complete work would be evident to all. I was concerned about      making this timepiece more acceptable and more understandable      to those people who are far distant and unable to see it, so      that this present exposition would obtain credulity among all.      I could find no better method than to set forth for the reader      the theory of the universe which I figured out after many      sleepless nights.       In testing this theory day after day, it not only appeared to      be complete, and true, but each day it appeared more      conformable to reality; it captured my mind in such a way that      I finally adhered to it. I desired, while I lived, to erect      this work as a monument to the theory. To do this, I digressed      a bit from the true-to-life pattern to the mechanical order so      that I could transfer all the movements of the heavens, etc.      (which I enjoyed thinking about more), to the plane surface of      the clock's face. In this way, the ecliptical spectacles of the      stars, etc., would appear at their proper times clearly before      the eyes of the viewer. I could also avoid many difficulties      which otherwise, perhaps, even the hands of the most skillful      craftsmen could never solve.

The translation in its entirety is: \"The Most Recent Theoretical-Practical Astronomical Clock According to the Equally Most Recent System of the World. Author: Francesco Borghesi of Mechel of Anáuni * Priest of Trent, Doctor of Philosophy * (The System of the Clock) Ingeniously connected to new theoretical laws published 1764: and the constructor, Bartholomeo Antonio Bertolla of Rumo, similarly from Anáuni * who skillfully produced this work * in this same current year of Our Lord * which is the year 5713 [sic] since God created this earth.

All other      theories of the make-up of the universe, however admirable, and      however many there are, turn the sun and earth around in an      ecliptic in an annual movement. Thus, Philolaus was the first      to move the earth from the center of the universe and move it      through the void; afterwards, Aristarchus of Samos and then      Copernicus moved the earth with the moon. The Egyptians, as      well as Pythagoras, Ptolemy, Tycho, Riciolus, Longomontanus,      etc., thought that the sun moved through the degrees of the      ecliptic each year. But I attributed this movement to neither      earth nor sun for the movement of both is only apparent. I did      not vainly surmise the annual equilibrium in all astronomical      observations to be from the daily movement of the same axis      moved at the poles of the heavens. Nor, in like manner, is      there a better way to satisfy physical experiments. To you,      then, most cultured reader: If you, perhaps, can make any use      or draw pleasure from this most faithful description of my new      theory and the mechanical instrument, refer it first to God on      High from whom is everything that is best, and then to those      avidly awaiting this little work. Lastly, if you find any      statement less fitting; in your humanity, do not disdain to      excuse it.     Borghesian Theory of the Universe   In Father Borghesi's second volume, there is a separate chapter entitled \"An Exposition of the Latest Theory of the Universe.\" This follows the introduction to the reader, and in it Father Borghesi proposed:       That you might rightly conceive my new system of the world and      mechanically, as it were, construct it, imagine for yourself,      beneath that most happy seat of the Blessed and above all other      heavens, a kind of spherical convexity, everywhere equidistant      from the center of the earth, and endowed with absolutely no      motion.       On the inside, at two points diametrically opposite each other,      this convexity has two most sturdy poles (to speak      mechanically), projecting towards the center (which you call      the poles of the heavens), and the largest immobile semicircle,      in some manner is drawn from the center of one pole to the      center of the other. This semicircle in the middle, namely at a      point equidistant from each pole, is thought to be secured by      some sign, for example, by that \"o,\" for arranging more      perceptibly the seat of the sun (as will be shown later). This      much must be conceived first.       You must understand that imposed on these poles is the first      mobile [Primum Mobile], everywhere convex, and divided, into 12      equal parts [Dodecatemoria], by the 6 greatest circles,      intersecting each other at the centers of the poles. Then it is      divided by another equally great circle, everywhere equidistant      from the poles, into two hemispheres. One hemisphere of 12      parts, proceeding in order from west [setting] to east [rising]      should be assigned the respective signs of the zodiac; that is,      one to Aries, the next to Taurus, and so on, etc. The circle      which cuts those 12 parts transversely in the middle, you call      the ecliptic. Then, these capital spaces of the Primum Mobile      are subdivided by degrees, minutes, etc., both in longitude and      in latitude, so that this heaven represents a kind of great      spherical net, extended to capture the longitude and latitude      of the stars, and Mobile on the aforementioned poles. Note,      however (and this is almost the leading point of the system),      in that circle of longitude which divides the sign of Gemini      from Cancer and Arcitenens [Sagittarius] from Capricorn, you      must conceive two points, directly opposite each other and      removed about twenty-three and a half degrees from the poles:      Boreal [the northern] between Gemini and Cancer; Austral [the      southern] between Sagittarius and Capricorn. These two points      by some power (imagine it is magnetic power), equal between      them, hold the terraqueous orb suspended in the middle, by      acting on the axis of the same orb (imagine it is iron) in such      a way that the earth is continually drawn to those two points      as to two opposite centers. It is never nearer to one, for as      it is about to move towards one, the opposite power is      constantly drawing it back. Thus,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33198"],["title","The Borghesi Astronomical Clock in the Museum of History and Technology (#8)"],["body"," those points and the      axis of the earth are always held in one common line, wherever      those points happen to be carried by the rotation of this      heaven.       Again, it is necessary for you to conceive in this heaven,      first, two great circles, bisecting each other at right angles      in the centers of these two magnets. One of these circles,      passing through the first point of Aries and Libra in the      ecliptic, is called equinoctial colure: the other circle,      passing consequently between the first point of Cancer and      Capricorn, is called solstitial colure. Beneath these are      likewise imagined many other great circles, in the centers of      the magnets dividing crosswise in the shape of an \"X.\" But if,      receding from these magnets, you describe circles (parallel to      each other and ever greater and greater, up to the greatest      circle which you will perceive is called the equator),      equidistant from each magnet and obliquely splitting the      ecliptic in the equinoctial colure, you can then behold a      great, new, woven net in this heaven of the Primum Mobile. This      net most beautifully expands to extract the straight ascent and      descent of the stars, etc., from the vast ocean of the heavens,      catching the straight ascent in the greatest circles and, in      other unequal circles, parallel to each other and obliquely      cutting across, most safely catching the descent.       Immediately below the Primum Mobile place the heaven of the      fixed stars (and, that the idea might be clearer), revolving      separately on the same poles on which the Primum Mobile      revolves. Through this heaven, the filaments of the little      nets, etc., seem to the eyes of you on earth as if they shine.      In this heaven, you should conceive in their fixed places, the      fixed stars, a proportionate, inviolable distance from each      other, and, indeed, if you will, the heavenly images, etc.,      depicted, and all carried along at the same time with their      heaven by one motion.       Conceive a straight line running from the center of the earth      to that sign \"o\" noted in the semicircle of the supreme      immobile heaven. On this line, greatly below the heaven of the      fixed stars, place the center of the solar epicycle, holding an      area in common with the ecliptic and subject to absolutely no      motions, but at such a distance from the center of the earth      that the semidiameter of the earth has little, if any,      proportion with the distance of the solar epicycle from the      earth. Around the sun, moving continually in this epicycle (its      immobile palace) through the degrees of the anomaly, you can      revolve, with motions proportionate to the system, the five      planets: Mercury and Venus (the nearest barons of the sun),      then Mars, Jupiter and, most remote, Saturn, with its      respective satellites, etc., eccentrically surrounding the      earth itself and the moon in their immense ambit and wandering      by their proper motions through the zodiac.       Nevertheless, not far from the earth you should imagine      fabricated, as from most refined crystal, the heaven of the      moon everywhere equidistant from the center of the earth and      revolving separately on the same poles (prolonged even to this      place) on which the Primum Mobile and the heaven of the fixed      stars revolve. In the middle of this, that is, in some point      equally removed from the poles, you place the center of the      lunar epicycle, movable also by the common rotation of the      lunar heaven. I refrain from the other movements of the moon in      latitude, etc., as also those of the five planets, etc., which      the theory in no way excludes, lest by a variety of congested      motions explained too abundantly, either you might be confused      about the fundamental concept of the system or, while adorning      the theory and trying to embellish the least things more      widely, you might reject also the things which are capital.       Here you already have the whole machine, but still inert and to      be animated for the first time by motions accommodated to the      system. Nevertheless, before I assign motion to the individual      parts of the world, so that the thing might later appear more      clearly to you, I arrange all things thus: first, as if by      hand, I turn the Primum Mobile until the Boreal magnetic point      comes to the level or the area of the semicircle described in      the supreme immobile convexity; then I turn the heaven of the      fixed stars until, for example, the heel of Castor (a star of      the third magnitude), almost in the ecliptic and indeed in our      time not far distant from the solstitial colure, likewise falls      nearly at the level of the aforesaid semicircle. Later, I turn      the lunar heaven until I bring the center of the lunar epicycle      to the same level. Then, I turn the earth until some      predetermined city, for example, Trent, situated in the      northern zone with a latitude of about forty-six degrees, is      brought to the oft-mentioned level.       From things arranged in this way and from what has gone before,      it is evident (with the motions of the luminaries in epicycles      left out, however, lest you be distracted by the explanation)      that at Trent, just as in the whole northern hemisphere, it is      the summer solstice; and, conversely, in the southern      hemisphere, it is the winter solstice. The reason is because      the northern magnetic point together with the northern half of      the earthly axis is at its highest point towards the sun,      immovably residing in a line sent through the level of the      highest semicircle; and, conversely, the southern magnetic      point with the corresponding half of the axis is most removed      from the same. It further follows, that noonday and the new      moon coincide, and the heel of Castor almost reaches the      summit, etc.       Now, beginning from this hypothetical situation of the whole      world as from the root of the motions, I move all things in      their circles so that the earth turns on its axis with a      revolving motion from west to east in each 24 hours of median      time. The lunar heaven completes one circle around its poles      likewise from west to east in the time of 29 terrestrial      revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13.1. The sphere of the fixed stars      on the same poles revolves once from east to west within 365      revolutions of the earth, hours 6.9.29.1. The Primum Mobile on      the poles (common to the heaven of the fixed stars and the      heaven of the moon), is moved once in the same way from east to      west, a little faster, however, than the heaven of the fixed      stars, yet within 365 revolutions of the earth, hours 5.48.56;      that is, within a median astronomical year.       Now, behold for yourself a new world supported on new poles and      provided with new motions and laws. Now you, reader and lover      of the stars, turn it, and revolve it as long as it pleases      you, and compare it astronomically and physically with the      Copernican or the Tychonian systems or with whatever one      pleases you more, and judge which one seems more consonant with      nature when all things are examined. But if you aren't able to      reconcile this theory with some astronomical observations or      physical experiments and think it should be eliminated from      the group of theories, see that I might know this while life is      still my companion, so that I might think with you, if this is      possible. Also, so that, in gratitude for the detected or      perhaps hidden error, I might speak or write, and you won't      have to shout in vain in bold ridicule and with no applause      after the fleeing shades of the dead and the mute ashes. But,      if you object that the daily motion of the revolving earth and      the annual motion of its whirling axis do not sufficiently      agree with certain texts of Sacred Scripture, and if those      things which the Copernicans and the Longomontanists say do not      convince you, then reject my whole system as an old wives'      tale.         *       *       *       *       *  GLOSSARY  ANOMOLIA or anomaly, is the angular distance of a planet from its perihelion (that point of the orbit of a planet which is nearest to the sun) as seen from the sun.  AEQUINOCTIUM or the equinox, is the time in which days and nights are equal in the space of hours. There are two equinoxes: the spring equinox--c. 8 calends of April in the sign of Aries; and the fall equinox--c. 10 calends of October in the sign of Libra.  AERAS is derived from _aera_, _aerae_, which originally meant a given number, usually used in regard to money. The word was later extended to mean a number used in any calculation, and finally it came to mean a certain time from which subsequent times were counted, e.g., _Anno Domini_, after the Birth of Christ.  COLURI or the Colures, which are two circles in the heavenly sphere, passing through the poles of the world and cutting each other at right angles: the one passes through the equinoctial points of Aries and Libra and is called _Colurus Aequinoctiorum_ or equinoctial colure; the other touches the _solstitialia_ of Cancer and Capricorn and is called _Colurus Solstitiorum_ or solstitial colure. They are called _Colurus_, which is translated as \"mutilated tails,\" for the part which emerges in the Antarctic is not visible and is quasitruncated.  ECLIPTICA or the ecliptic, is an imaginary line in the heavens in which the sun was supposed to have performed its annual course.  EPICYCLUS or epicycle, is a small orb which, being fixed in the deferent of a planet, is carried along with its motion and yet, with its own peculiar motion, carries the body of the planet fastened to it round about its "]]]
