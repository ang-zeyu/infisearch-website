Tossing the cigarette away, he realized suddenly his fight was futile. He couldn't possibly hold out until Jim returned, or in the hope that some other vessel would happen along. The pile, his arm, spillthrough, the Fleury threatening to break in two ... he enumerated all the factors.  If he went aboard the Cluster Queen now, Altman would at least give him passage to port. Any charges Brad would make would never hold up without substantiation. And Altman would see that he brought nothing with him that could back up the accusations. It would be just as easy for the crew of the Queen to prove that Brad Conally had conceived the whole weird account of assault and piracy as a means of winning back the cargo he was faced with losing.  He knew, however, that no matter what happened, he could kiss the Fleury goodbye. Altman would never allow it to reach port. There might be evidence aboard--perhaps evidence as simple as finger prints--to prove that Altman or one of his crew had tampered with the machinery.  Brad reached out to extend the gooseneck of the mike toward him.         *       *       *       *       *  But the stellar grid showing through the direct-view port was blotted out suddenly. He jerked his gaze to the scope. The Queen was overhead--almost within grappling distance!  He started to shout out, but at the same time brilliant hell exploded outside.  The Cluster Queen's jetwash raked across the upper bow of the Fleury, throwing its nose down and its tail up and over in a hateful, wrenching spin.  The spin continued, losing none of its neck-snapping vehemence, as the Queen burst off into space. The harness cut across Brad's aching arm and set up a new, rending torture. But his good arm shot out and found the forward belly jet lever.  With what mushily reacted like the last erg of energy in the normal drive converter tanks, the jet responded feebly. He nursed the power carefully, determined not to waste juice through overcorrection. Finally the Fleury steadied and resumed immobility of attitude.  \"Sorry, Conally,\" Altman apologized with exaggerated concern. \"But her majesty's acting up frisky-like. Can't seem to do much with her.... Maybe if you came aboard we might find some way to quiet her down. How about it?\"  Brad bit his lips and tightened his good fist until fingernails knifed into the palm. \"No, damn you!\" he shouted with all the volume his lungs could muster.  He summoned all the spacewise epithets any stevedore or crewman had ever used, added a few he imagined no one had thought of before, and held them in abeyance until Altman would answer.  But no sound came out of the speaker.  The reason was apparent on the scope. A half dozen of the massive crates had crashed through the hull--this time out of hold number One, the massometer showed--and the Cluster Queen was on her way to take them aboard.  But he was more concerned with another complication. The red power utilization indicator of the good hypertube was in motion, swinging back to zero on its dial. He saw the flicker of the needle in the corner of his vision.  He checked the suspicion against the blips on the scope and obtained verification ... the outlines of the Queen and the crates were fuzzy, despite the fact they were still nearby spatially. The fuzziness could only result from the Fleury's being removed hyperspatially from that vicinity.  He had accidentally touched the hyperjet lever while applying normal power to correct the three-dimensional spin. Which way had he moved it? Had he gone further into hyperspace? Or had he fallen further down the descending node toward spillthrough?  Studying sensations in his body for an indication of abnormal pain, he stared abruptly out the view port. The twisting pain was there--inside his chest. The star lines were short.  He swore and scowled at his luck.  Then, as the pain intensified, he grasped the lever of the hyperjet again and thrust it forward. The tube sputtered feebly, came on full force for a second, sputtered again and was silent.  He jerked the lever back and forth on the forward side of neutral and rammed it desperately all the way forward. The tube coughed, grabbed once more for a moment, and sputtered out. He goosed it four more times, but only got two boosts as a result. Then he twisted it past the stop to the first emergency position. It wheezed, fired for two seconds and died.  Sweat forming in beads on his face, he ignored the pain in his shoulder and reached to the control column with his injured arm. He swung back the second safety stop bar out of the way and rammed the lever all the way forward.  The tube fired for another second, but that was all. He had used the last erg.  But how much time had he bought with his final means of retreat from the spillthrough trough? He checked the celestial crisscrosses.... Not much....         *       *       *       *       *  Altman? he wondered suddenly. Where was the Cluster Queen? It wasn't showing up on the scope any longer. Neither were the crates. Had he retrieved them and shoved off? Brad jiggled the scope's brilliance control, wondering whether it was faulty and was simply not registering the Queen.  An abrupt _thud_, coincident with a sharp jar throughout the ship and a sudden shifting of the pseudogravitational field almost to normal, brought him upright in his seat. He realized immediately what was happening.  He hadn't been able to pick up the Queen on the scope because it was too close to register as a blip separate from the central luminescence on the screen which was representative of the Fleury itself. Altman had maneuvered alongside, aligned the hatch flanges of the two ships and activated his magnetic grapples. The nearness of his grav coils had restored some of the Fleury's internal stability. He was preparing to board the Fleury. He would be aboard within ten minutes.... It took that long to make minute adjustments in order to insure perfect superimposition of the flange surfaces.  Brad smiled grimly and unsnapped his harness with nervous fingers. If he could get into his suit in time, it would be simple to open a hatch aft and let the air spill from the Fleury. Then when Altman undogged the inner hatch of the Fleury's air lock, it would be sucked open violently and pull the skipper of the Cluster Queen into a vacuum. It would make a mess out of the air lock and the control compartment--but that would be advantageous. It would be evidence to prove at least that Altman had taken the initiative in boarding the Fleury without first dispatching his intention of doing so to the nearest port, as required by the law.  Brad planned that if he then found the Queen's locks dogged, he would temporarily close the Fleury's inner lock and fill the between-ships passage with normal pressure air so he would be able to open the Queen's hatches against the thirty-pound pressure in the other ship. After opening her hatches, he would leap back to the Fleury's inner hatch, release the single doglatch and let the vacuum suck all the air from the other ship too. He would immediately report the defensive action to Vega IV, borrow emergency cad rods from the Queen, prevent an internal pile blast aboard the Fleury and withdraw the crippled ship, together with its engine compartment evidence, to the node of the arc to await the arrival of investigators.  He clamped the helmet on his neck ring with a minute to spare as he reassured himself it was a perfect plan and had a reasonable chance to success. It was one too that required no physical exertion. He couldn't go through any rough stuff with his sprained arm.         *       *       *       *       *  Stiffening, he watched the first of the six doglatches on the hatch swing to the unlocked position. He moved over against the starboard bulkhead, well away from the hatch. He would have to get out of the suit again, and it would be a messy job if he were standing close to Altman when the vacuum went to work on him.  The final doglatch unsnapped. The hatch crashed open and he imagined he could almost hear the swoosh of escaping air.  Instead he heard a mocking voice over his audio.  \"You were right, captain,\" the voice laughed.  \"Who'd think Conally would try a trick like that?\" Altman taunted, extending a spacesuit clad leg across the hatch ledge.  \"You would and did.... He'll probably be right behind the hatch to the left there, boss.\"  Brad sprang forward.  But Altman turned suddenly in his direction and pointed a gun at Brad's stomach. It checked the attack. Brad backed away hopelessly.  \"Okay,\" Altman jerked his head in the confines of the helmet, \"go to work.\"  The crewman from the Queen stepped into the control cabin and walked toward the passageway aft while Altman held the gun on Brad.  \"Think you can do it quick enough?\" Altman asked the crewman. \"Radiation, you know.\"  The crewman thrust the wide-mouthed gun above his shoulder where Altman could see it. \"It'll just take one shot with this.\"  He disappeared down the passageway.  \"Hell, captain,\" the voice sounded a minute later. \"It's dead. He musta used up all his reserve juice in that last surge upward.\"  \"Okay,\" Altman smiled--a weird, distorted smile as seen through the thick, rounded helmet. \"Come on back.\" He looked at Brad. \"So you can't pull away from the trough any longer? That's tough.\"  Brad wanted to say, Okay, Altman, I'll go aboard the Queen with you. But he didn't. He realized the plea would have been futile anyway as he watched the crewman rejoin Altman and heard the latter say: \"Just think, Conally, you could have come aboard. I would have let you a while back. But you've made this thing too tough and gave my boys the chance to convince me we might have slipped up somewhere and you might be able to prove your side of the story.\"  The pair retreated to the air lock. Brad stood motionless, staring, not breathing.  \"The pile'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32657"],["title","Spillthrough (#4)"],["body",",\" the crewman announced, \"for another four hours, just about.\"  \"Fine!\" Altman exclaimed. \"This junk'll slip through within an hour. That'll give us another three hours, at least, to get this stiff aboard the Queen and transfer cargo before she blows. Then we can mop up on whatever crates we've....\"  But the air lock closed and the rest of his words were cut off.         *       *       *       *       *  If he could only get cleaned up before it came. If he could only enjoy the luxury of a bath, a shave, clean clothes. Brad laughed at the last item, wondering how clothes could be expected to remain clean if they were on someone making the spillthrough transition at coasting speed.  The Fleury lurched as the Queen cut loose and blasted away. Brad had watched the pressure gauge climb back to normal and was removing his helmet at the time. The ship's one-sided gravity field caught hold unexpectedly and he toppled to the deck rolling to the port bulkhead. His hurt shoulder rammed into metal and new pain knifed into existence as the heavy helmet clattered down and crashed against his head. The blow almost stunned him. But it left him with enough awareness to wish it _had_ knocked him insensible--permanently insensible.  The scope showed more cargo had spilled out in the last lurch. The Queen started over toward the crates, but coasted past, turned and came back to take post spatially alongside the disabled craft. Already the other ship's outline was beginning to blur as the Fleury slipped away from her hyperspatially--down the arc.  Brad straddle-stepped on the deck and bulkhead to the control column and broke out his pack of cigarettes. Suddenly his feet left the deck. The port gray coil had gone out, he realized grimly, the current having dropped below the minimum requirements. For a moment he became concerned over weightlessness. Then he cut in the heel magna-grips of his suit and clanged onto the floor. At least, he wasn't confronted with a topsy-turvy ship any longer. He blew a cloud of smoke into the air and half-centered his attention on the scope. Two more crates had left the Fleury's holds. With the grav fields out on the ship, they did not take up orbit. They just floated away, at an almost imperceptible speed. But the Queen was still apparently not interested in picking them up. There would be plenty of time to do that; right now she must stick close to the Fleury spatially, Brad realized, so her instruments would indicate the moment the spillthrough to normal space occurred, so her crew could get to work.  As though hypnotized in inconsequential thought, he watched the crates slowly draw away. Almost incredibly expensive cargo. Cargo that Altman would surely not allow to go unrecovered. Even as booty, the crated equipment would bring every bit of what it was worth. But Altman would see that they were delivered--every one of them. A contract with West Cluster meant a good deal more than the face value of the one shipment of inter-calc banks.  Brad started and his face became alive with expression as a sudden realization drove home. It was followed almost immediately by a second jarring consideration. He tossed away the half-consumed cigarette.  It wasn't more than fifteen minutes later when he stood before the mike again.  \"Altman,\" he called out.  Silence.  \"Altman,\" he shouted louder.  \"Go ahead and answer him, captain. Let's see what he has to say.\"  \"You can't come aboard, Conally,\" Altman said finally.  \"If you don't let me come aboard I'll slip through and be killed.\"  \"Ain't that touching!\"  \"You mean you won't pick me up?\"  \"We'll pick you up all right--we wanna take what's left of you back to show how you died.\"  \"It's like that then? You're going to kill me to get the cargo?\"  \"You're learning fast.\"  \"Are you going to hook on to the Fleury and drag her in to port?\"  \"Are you nuts? The inspectors could easily find out that we worked her over before you left port.... What's the matter--got a sentimental attachment for that old crate?\"  \"Look, Altman....\"  \"Go to hell, Conally.\"  The background hum died out of the Fleury's receiver abruptly. Brad called twice. But there was no answer.         *       *       *       *       *  The SS Fleury was vibrant with the final pounding of its weakening vital parts.  _Clank-sss, clank-sss_, the coolant's safety valve hissed. _Boom ... boom_, the jangling piston rod pounded. The expanding metal plate added its _throom-throom_ note.  The counter in the passageway _clackety-clacked_ louder.  Their lines snapped by persistent tremors and lurches, more crates danced in the holds. Some of them eventually found their way to the gaping holes in the hull and, receiving a final, brief kick from jagged metal, floated lightly out into space.  In the scope of the Cluster Queen, the Fleury's outline became fuzzier.  With mounting groans, the tortured vessel wrenched violently as she slipped down the descending arc.  Then suddenly she was through--in normal space where stars shown with pinpoint brilliancy and where the celestial sphere was no longer a lazy, crazy crisscross of blurred lines.  The Cluster Queen started a wide hyperspatial turn, remaining spatially alongside the Fleury. She gathered speed as she swung around and straightened out and, with hyperjets blasting full force, plunged through the barrier in somewhat less time than a milli-second.  Ahead, the Fleury was picked up immediately on the scope. Like a hawk, the Queen closed the distance to the other trembling, silent ship.         *       *       *       *       *  Vega IV's spaceport was bathed in brilliant, blue-cast light from the magnificent sun.  The Cluster Queen was docked. A tractor kept itself busy rolling up the ramp into the ship and out again with huge crates that were apparently in somewhat poorer condition than when they left Arcturus II. An occasional splintered board jutted outward, held to its box only by loose nails.  Three men were next to the hold's hatch. They stood grouped about an elongated form that lay on the concrete apron, covered with a white square of linen. A spacesuit clad arm jutted out under one side of the covered square.  \"We'll take you over to the office,\" Inspector Graham was saying. \"You'll have to make out an affidavit, you know. We'll need a couple of your crewmen to verify it.\"  \"Be glad to,\" Altman answered. \"Any time you're ready.\"  \"As soon as they pick up--Conally,\" the inspector looked down at the form.  \"I don't understand it,\" Jim muttered, rubbing a thumb and forefinger over closed eyelids.  \"_Maybe I've got a version that's easier to understand, Jim_,\" the voice sounded forcefully from the direction of the hatch.  Inspector Graham and Altman spun around.  Jim didn't have to. He was facing the hatch.  Altman blanched; backed away; stopped, and held his ground.  \"Brad!\" Jim shouted unbelievingly and rushed forward to grasp his arms as the Fleury's skipper leaped off the side of the ramp. He was haggard but smiling.  \"Who's this?\" the inspector asked.  \"This is Conally, the skipper of the Fleury,\" Jim explained jubilantly.  The inspector started, looked at the form on the apron, back at Brad, then at Altman.  \"A trick!\" Altman cried hoarsely. \"I see it all, inspector. It's a damned trick! I've been roped in!\"  He was putting on a rather good act, Brad thought. But he went along with his story anyway. As Brad unfolded the incidents of sabotage, threat, assault, refusal to assist, pirating cargo, plotting murder and disregard of Space Code Regulations, he watched Altman gain more control over himself.  \"I realized about an hour before spillthrough,\" Brad was approaching the end of his account, \"that the Fleury was no longer holding the spilled cargo in an orbit because its grav system wasn't working. Whatever crates broke free from the holds also broke free from the ship's system and were no longer being dragged down the descending node toward spillthrough. They were remaining stationary on the arc--where Altman was sure to pick them up.  \"Your spacesuit, Jim, came in handy. Without it, nothing could have been done. I just filled it up with anything I could find--extra clothing, insulation from the ruptured tube, a few utensils. It didn't make any difference. The crew members who would handle the \"body\" would believe it felt as torn apart as any other space suited body that experienced spillthrough at a snail's pace.  \"To add weight, I broke open a bin of hematite and poured about a hundred pounds or so of the stuff into the suit. I stirred it gently; got more hematite--red ocher, you know--and half-filled the helmet. We had enough control column oil left to wet it down rather thoroughly. The new mixture had a rich, dark-red color, just like I thought it would. I sloshed the goo around in the helmet so all the inner surface was coated with the mixture and with small bits of indistinguishable odds and ends; then I clamped the dome onto the suit and harnessed it in the pilot's seat.  \"I put on my own helmet again, went aft and crawled into a half-busted crate. With the wrist propulsor, I jockeyed the thing out of the hold to make damned sure it would break free of the Fleury's system and wouldn't spill through with the ship. After I saw I was drifting off, I worked my way well into the bracing between the crate and the inter-calc unit so I couldn't be seen through the broken sections of the box.  \"Sure enough--about three hours later, along comes grabbenheimer,\" he threw a thumb in Altman's direction, \"with his grapples. I was able to squeeze out of the suit an hour or so after that. But I've been cramped up in that crate for two days, with only emergency rations.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Altman loosed a sarcastic laugh and turned to the inspector. \"It's a damned clever trick, inspector!\" he shouted. \"I been grappled in on the scheme.... Like I said, I arrived when he was slipping through. I couldn't do anything to stop it. Naturally I"]]]
