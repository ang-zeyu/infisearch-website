She fumbled in her handbag for a cigarette. She found a stale pack, shook one out. She lit it with a safety match and extinguished the match with a nervous flick of her arm. She inhaled.  The invasion. For the first time since she'd left the hotel it reoccurred to her.  Oh, Lord! she thought. How much time before that! She dropped her cigarette and ground it out.  The clerk was bending over, comparing signatures.  I've got to do something about the invasion! I've got to tell somebody! But ... but ... how can I ever convince anyone?  They'd think I was crazy. They'd detain me for questioning. They'd lock me up. If they did, he could come upon me and I couldn't even run!  Her face was bloodless. If I had my powers back....  She began to pace. Two steps one way; two steps back; two steps the other way.  I could ... I could show them how to operate on a human to make the bridge; I could talk to a surgeon....  Could I?  Her mind was fuzzy. It was no longer easy to remember. So many compartments were no longer available.  Do I remember how? You ... you.... She concentrated with every fiber of her being.  \"Your signature is shakey,\" the clerk said.  She whirled on him. Her lips trembled. She choked back hot words.  \"I'm upset tonight,\" she said weakly.  He grunted.  _If he catches me_, she thought, _I'll be dead._ He'll kill me! I'll never be able to convince anyone then!  Hurry, hurry, hurry!  \"How do you want the money?\" the clerk asked.  \"Any way! Any way!\"  He began to count bills.  If I stand still, he'll catch me! she moaned to herself. Even now....  She glanced toward the door.  \"There,\" the clerk said.  Trembling, she stuffed bills into her handbag. She raced for the entrance.         *       *       *       *       *  She burst from the revolving doors. She cried out to the taxi idling across the street. The driver started the motor. She ran across the street to the car.  \"Take me to a car lot that's open!\"  \"Yes, Lady.\"  She fumbled out a bill and threw it at him. She settled back in the seat. \"Hurry!\"  He looked at the bill. \"_Yes, indeed._\" He started the car. \"I sure will.\"  The cab whirled away and U-turned toward Vermont.  She felt better to be moving.  And ten minutes later she was arguing with a salesman.  \"This will do,\" she insisted. \"I don't want a triple-guarantee, a road test, a service check, a--\"  \"I'll have to make out a bill of sale.\"  \"All I want to know is: Is the gas tank full?\"  Indignantly, the salesman said: \"Of course.\"  \"Mail me the bill of sale! Tear it up! I don't care! Here--Here's my hotel.\" After thrusting the card on him, she began to count money.  \"The keys are in the ignition. I'll get your extra set. The license--\" He began to recount the money.  She got behind the wheel, snapped on the lights, pressed the ignition button. The motor coughed and roared.  She spun the car out of the lot. She was weak with relief.  Maybe I can outrun him!  I hope.  _I've got to!_  I'll get as far away as I can. Then I'll ... I'll have to take a chance waiting for an airplane. Then ... then ... when my money gives out....  I can't hope to run forever.  She shuddered.         *       *       *       *       *  Walt crawled out of the wreck. It seemed to be a miracle he was unhurt.  He had switched the car to automatic drive as he had seen the driver on the desert do; he had not known that there was no automatic-drive beam on that particular stretch of highway.  At the first curve--in a heart beat of time; too fast for him to avert it--the car had hurtled the road and plowed into the embankment.  Walt cursed and shook his head and closed his eyes tightly, gathering his thoughts.  A few minutes later a car with intensely bright headlights stopped to give assistance. Walt threw the driver out and slipped behind the wheel.  In a moment he knew that he had a powerful motor under him.     CHAPTER VIII   An hour later (two of the twelve hours were gone) Julia was still free. She had weaved and twisted across the city. She had crossed and recrossed the super-highways and the local speedways. She had fled up ramps and through under passes.  She had no way of telling how near Walt was; or what moment and from what direction death might strike. She did not believe that he could reach out through space to snatch her life; if he tried teleportation, she was steeled to resist. The lifeless, glittering windows, the dull glare of overhead and curb lights, the shuttle movement of traffic, the heavy, motionless air--all these combined into bristling menace. Her foot strained against the accelerator; her muscles ached over the wheel.  She hoped she had confused him. Now she streamed for the open highway. She settled the car into a traffic slot on the north-bound coast super-highway. She switched the car on automatic and tried to relax.  The road curved gently toward the west to pick up the coast line. Soon the moonlit breakers hissed on white sand beaches. The ocean lay dark and mysterious toward the far horizon.  She prayed that Walt would not guess for long minutes that she had left the city; that he would lose more precious minutes locating the super-highway.  San Francisco was six hours ahead of her.         *       *       *       *       *  Walt was continually losing himself in a maze of Los Angeles streets. Ones that seemed to promise to deliver him cross-town to interrupt Julia in her erratic course twined away in improper directions. Occasionally he neared her. But she darted away each time: as if with the primeval instinct of a hunted animal.  At last he stopped the car and cried to a pedestrian across the street: \"Is there any place I can get a map of the city?\"  \"Ask inna filling station.\"  Walt snarled. And five minutes later he found the map. He memorized it carefully; it required scarcely more than a minute. During that time, he let his body rest and relax. He threw the map onto the driveway. He grew increasingly more confident of catching her as the information settled into his brain. He visualized the map.  He was ready for her now.  She was already on the super-highway. He left the filling station. He was in no hurry. He was waiting for her to return.  It soon became apparent that she would not.  He grunted and spun his car in her direction.  He lost several minutes in a traffic jam downtown. He got on the wrong lane in a clover leaf beyond the city limits. He had now passed beyond the boundaries of the map he had memorized. He took the ridge super-highway instead of the one Julia had taken. After twenty miles, he realized his mistake and had to cut over. He bounced along an east-west road that was so rough-surfaced he had to reduce his speed.  When he finally arrived on the proper highway he was almost an hour behind Julia.  He concentrated on understanding the physical assembly of the engine in front of him. He could teleport parts from it; he could hold other parts more tightly together by using the same power. But the engine was so very complex. There was (he could tell) something there--in the engine itself--that kept the power from being utilized. He could not locate the block.  He increased the speed by tightening the valves. But the required concentration was too great to be long maintained. It exhausted him and forced him to rest for a few miles. Then he tightened the valves again. The car moved forward in a sudden burst of speed.         *       *       *       *       *  In San Francisco Julia stopped long enough for a sandwich--long enough to gulp hot coffee--long enough to buy a box of \"Wide-awakes.\" She checked airline schedules by phone.  The eastern flights were held up by weather over the Rockies. The next strato-jet to Hawaii was due to leave in thirty minutes; but she would have to wait to see if any reservations were canceled before she could be assured of a seat. There would not be another plane south for an hour and a half. One was leaving just then.  She told herself that the airport would become a cul-de-sac unless she could time it perfectly; she could not risk it.  She cruised the city until she had been there over an hour. She was loggy and exhausted.  She was afraid to remain any longer. He might head her off; he might trap her in a dead end street. Once on the straight of way, there was--at least--no danger of that. She left the city and headed north again.         *       *       *       *       *  Walt arrived ten minutes before she left. He came to a stop at an all night lunch. Invisible, he slipped through walls into the kitchen. He stole food, returned to his car with it, ate it. He drove to a gas station, keeping her position sharply in mind.  \"Gas,\" he ordered the attendant.  The attendant began filling the tank.  \"All the way full,\" Walt said. \"I want a map of the city when you finish.\"  The attendant brought the map. Walt unfolded it.  Julia had left the city. Walt was not going to be fooled this time. But he wanted to memorize the city just in case she did double back.  \"Is there ... a larger map? Of this whole area?\"  The attendant brought him a California map. He memorized that one. He picked out Julia's route. He verified it.  \"Pay up, now,\" the attendant said. \"I gotta car waitin'. It's five sixty-seven altogether.\"  Walt reached through the rolled down window and seized the man. He jerked him forward and down; and, with the same motion, slammed his own weight against the inside of the unlocked door. The steel top of the opening door cracked the attendant across the forehead; he went limp. Walt let go of him, closed the door, and drove off.  By the time he sighted her car ahead of him on the highway, in the mist and fog of dawn, nearly eleven hours had elapsed since he had begun the pursuit. It had been only a half an hour before that he had located the governor and teleported it out of the engine.     CHAPTER IX   Julia saw the bright lights behind her.

In this book I have assumed that the many researchers now actually at work on this problem will achieve such a result in the next decade. It is not at all impossible that they may--for we all know that the more minds that work at a problem, the sooner it will be solved. The discovery of a means of negating, reversing or otherwise utilizing the immense force of gravitation for space flight purposes is now thought to be within the bounds of probability. It should occur some time within the next hundred years, possibly in even the short period I assume here.  Once solved, the severe handicaps imposed on space exploration by the weight and chemical limitations of rockets would no longer apply. The whole timetable of our conquest of the planets in our solar system would be tremendously speeded up, from hot Mercury all the way out to frigid Pluto.  In describing the visits of the spaceship _Magellan_ to the planets, I have endeavored to adhere to known facts and the more reasonable assumptions about each of these worlds. The planet Pluto, however, deserves further comment, occupying as it does both an important role in this adventure and a unique one in actual astronomical lore.  Back at the dawn of this century, many astronomers, and notably Dr. Percival Lowell, studied certain irregularities in the orbit and motion of Neptune, at that time believed to be the outermost planet. They decided that these eccentricities (or perturbations, as they are called) could only be caused by the presence of another, yet undiscovered planet beyond Neptune.  Following this line of research, a young astronomer, Dr. Clyde Tombaugh, working at Lowell's own observatory, was able to announce on March 13, 1930, that he had finally found this ninth world, which he named Pluto.  In the years that have followed, Pluto has proven to be a truly puzzling planet. Unlike its neighbors from Jupiter outward, it is not a giant world, light and gaseous in nature. Instead, it belongs physically to the small, dense inner planets of which Earth is one.  The latest viewpoint on this planet, whose size and weight seem quite like those of Earth, is that it may not be a true child of the Sun, but an outsider captured as it roamed the trackless realms of galactic space. Its orbit is highly eccentric and rather lopsided, taking it as far away from the Sun as four and a half billion miles and as close to the Sun as two and three-quarter billion miles, thereby cutting inside the orbit of Neptune itself. In fact, during the period from 1969 to 2009 (covering most of the lifetimes of the younger readers of this book) Pluto will not be the ninth planet, but the eighth, for it will be at its closest in those years. Huge Neptune will thus regain temporarily the title of being the Sun's farthest outpost!  This orbital eccentricity has lead some astronomers to speculate on the possibility that Pluto may once have been briefly held as a satellite of Neptune. And following that line of thought, the possibility also has been suggested that Neptune's larger moon, Triton, may once have been a companion of Pluto which failed to break away from Neptune's grip!  I think that the first men to land on Pluto are going to make some very astonishing discoveries. But I am also sure that they will never go there in rockets. They will have to make the immense trip by some more powerful means--like the anti-gravitational drive.  D.A.W.     _The Secret of the Ninth Planet_     Chapter 1. _Special Delivery--by Guided Missile_   On the morning that the theft of the solar system's sunlight began, Burl Denning woke up in his sleeping bag in the Andes, feeling again the exhilaration of the keen, rarefied, mountain air. He glanced at the still sleeping forms of his father and the other members of the Denning expedition, and sat up, enjoying the first rays of the early morning.  The llamas were already awake, moving restlessly back and forth on their padded feet, waiting for their tender to arise and unleash them. The mules were standing patiently as ever, staring quietly into the distant misty panorama of the mountains.  It was, thought Burl, a dim day, but this he supposed was due to the earliness of the morning. As the Sun rose, it would rapidly bring the temperatures up, and its unshielded rays would force them to cover up as they climbed along the high mountain passes.  The sky was cloudless as usual. Burl assumed that the dimness was due to volcanic dust, or some unseen high cloud far away. And, indeed, as the expedition came to life, and the day began in earnest, nobody paid any attention to the fact that the Sun was not quite so warm as it should have been.  The Denning expedition, questing among the untracked and forgotten byways of the lost Inca ruins in the vast, jagged mountains of inland Peru, was not alone in failing to notice the subtle channeling away of the Sun's warmth and brilliance. They were, in this respect, one with virtually the entire population of Earth.  In New York, in San Francisco, in Philadelphia and Kansas City, people going about their day's chores simply assumed that there must be clouds somewhere--the temperature only slightly less than normal for a July day. A few men shaded their eyes and looked about, noticing that the heat was not so intense--and thought it a blessing.  In some places in Europe, there were clouds and a little rain, and the dimness was ascribed to this. It was raining in much of Asia, and there were scattered afternoon showers throughout Latin America, which were standard for the season. There was a flurry of snow in Melbourne and a cold blow in Santiago de Chile.  The men in the weather bureaus noted on their day's charts that temperatures were a few degrees lower than had been predicted, but that was nothing unusual. Weather was still not entirely predictable, even with the advances of meteorology that were to be expected of the latter years of the twentieth century.  The world was reading about other things than the vagaries of the weather. In the United States, baseball occupied the headlines, and the nonathletic-minded could find some speculative interest in the completion of another manned space platform racing along in its eternal orbit twelve thousand miles away from Earth's surface. The U.S. Moon Base in the center of the Crater Ptolemaeus had described the appearance of this platform in an interesting radio dispatch which appeared on the first pages of most newspapers. The third prober rocket sent to Venus had been unreported for the tenth day after penetrating the clouds that hid that planet's surface from human eyes. It was, like its two predecessors, a minimum-sized, unmanned instrument device designed to penetrate the clouds and radio back data on the nature of the Venusian atmosphere and the surface. But after its first report, nothing more had been heard.  Some discussion was going on in science circles about what had happened. Speculation centered on the possible success of other types of prober rockets, but it was universally agreed that the time had not come when a manned rocket could safely undertake the difficult trip to Venus and return.  The years of space flight since the orbiting of Sputnik I back in 1957 had produced many fascinating results, but they had also brought a realization of the many problems that surrounded the use of rockets for space flight. It was generally believed that no one should risk a manned flight until absolutely everything possible that could be learned by robot and radio-controlled missiles had been learned. It now looked as if Venus and Mars trips were still a dozen years away.  Burl Denning was keenly interested in all of this. As a senior in high school, the newly expanding frontiers of the universe represented something special to his generation. It would be men of his own age who would eventually man those first full-scale expeditions to neighbor worlds. By the time he was out of college, with an engineering degree, he might himself hope to be among those adventurers of space.  Burl was torn between two interests. Archaeology was both a profession and a hobby in the Denning family. His grandfather had been among the first to explore the jungle ruins of Indochina. His father, although a businessman and industrial engineer, made annual vacation pilgrimages to the ruins of the old Indian civilizations of the Americas. Burl had been with him once before, when they had trekked through the chicle forests of Guatemala in search of a lost Mayan city. And now they were again on "]]]
