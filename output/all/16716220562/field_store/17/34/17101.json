The telephone rang again in another half minute. It was Stoddard again.  \"Mr. Kermit, pleeeease listen to me! I beg of you, come out here at once. It's terribly important!\"  I didn't say a word this time. I just hung right up.  In another half minute the telephone was jangling again. I was purple when I picked it up this time.  \"Listen,\" I bellowed. \"I don't care what noises you're hearing now--\"  Stoddard cut in desperately, shouting at the top of his lungs to do so.  \"I'm not only hearing the noises, Kermit,\" he yelled, \"I'm _seeing_ the people who cause them!\"         *       *       *       *       *  This caught me off balance.  \"Huh?\" I gulped.  \"The belfry,\" he yelled, \"I went up in the belfry, and you can see the people who's voices we heard!\" There was a pause, while he found breath, then he shouted, \"You have to come over. You're the only one I can think of to show this to!\"  Stoddard was an eccentric, but only so far as his tastes in architecture were concerned. I realized this, as I sat there gaping foolishly at the still vibrating telephone in my hand.  \"Okay,\" I said, for no earthly reason that I could think of, \"okay, hang on. I'll be there in twenty minutes.\"  Mrs. Stoddard met me at the door this time. She was worried, almost frightened, and very bewildered.  \"George is upstairs, Mr. Kermit. He won't let me come up there. He told me to send you up the minute you arrived. He's up in the attic.\"  \"What on earth,\" I began.  \"I don't know,\" his wife said. \"I was down in the basement drying some clothes, when I heard this terrible yelling from George. Then he was calling you on the telephone. I don't know what it's all about.\"  I raced up to the attic in nothing flat, almost knocking my teeth out on the bottom step of the attic stairs.  Then I stumbled into the darkness of the attic, and saw Stoddard's flashlight bobbing around in a corner.  \"Kermit?\"  It was Stoddard's voice.  \"Yes,\" I answered. \"What in the hell is up? It had better be goo--.\"  \"Hurry,\" Stoddard said. \"Over here, quickly!\"  I stumbled across the board spacings until I was standing beside Stoddard and peering up at what the beam of his flashlight revealed on the ceiling--a ragged, open hole, which he'd made by tearing several coatings of insulation from the spot.  For a minute, I couldn't make out anything in that flash beam glare. Stoddard had hold of my arm, and was saying one word over and over, urgently.  \"Look. Look. Look!\"  Then my eyes got adjusted to the light change, and I was aware that I was gazing up into the interior of the crazy belfry atop the monstrous house. Gazing up into the interior, while voices, quite loud and clearly distinguishable, were talking in a language which I didn't recognize immediately. As far as my vision was concerned, I might as well have been looking at a sort of grayish vaporish screen of some sort, that was all I saw.  \"Shhhh!\" Stoddard hissed now. \"Don't say a word. Just listen to them!\"  I held my breath, although it wasn't necessary. As I said, the voices coming down from that belfry were audible enough to have been a scant ten or twelve feet away. But I held my breath anyway, meanwhile straining my eyes to pierce that gray screen of vapor on which the light was focused.  And then I got it. The voices were talking in German, two of them, both harsh, masculine.  \"What in the hell,\" I began. \"Is there a short wave set up there or--\"  Stoddard cut me off. \"Can't you see it yet?\" he hissed.         *       *       *       *       *  The voices went on talking, while I strained my eyes even more in an effort to pierce that gray fog covering the rent in the ceiling. And then I saw. Saw at first, as if through a thin gray screen of gauze.  I was looking up into a room of some sort. A big room. An incredibly big room. A room so big that two dozen belfry rooms would have fit into it!  And then it got even clearer. There was a desk at the end of the room. A tremendously ornate desk. A desk behind which was sitting a small, gray uniformed, moustached man.  There was another uniformed person of porcine girth standing beside that desk and pointing to a map on the wall in front of him. He was jabbering excitedly to the little man at the desk, and he wore a uniform that was so plushily gaudy it was almost ridiculous.  The two kept chattering back and forth to each other in German, obviously talking about the map at which the fat, plush-clad one was pointing.  I turned incredulously to Stoddard.  \"Wh-wh-what in the hell goes?\" I demanded.  Stoddard seemed suddenly vastly relieved. \"So you see it and hear it, too!\" he exclaimed. \"Thank God for that! I thought I'd lost my mind!\"  I grabbed hard on his arm. \"But listen,\" I began.  \"Listen, nothing,\" he hissed. \"We _both_ can't be crazy. Those are the voices we kept hearing before. And those two people are the talkers. Those two German (five words censored) louses. Hitler and Goering!\"  There, he'd said it. I hadn't dared to. It sounded too mad, too wildly, babblingly insane to utter. But now I looked back through that thin gray cheesecloth of fog, back into the room.  The two occupants couldn't be anyone other than Hitler and Goering. And I was suddenly aware that the map Goering pointed to so frequently was a map of Austria.  \"But what,\" I started again.  Stoddard looked me in the eye. \"I can understand a little German,\" he said. \"They're talking about an invasion of Austria, and if you will look hard at the corner of that map, you'll see a date marked--1938!\"  I did look hard, and of course I saw that date. I turned back to Stoddard.  \"We're both crazy,\" I said a little wildly, \"we're both stark, raving nuts. Let's get out of here.\"  \"We are looking back almost five years into the past,\" Stoddard hissed. \"We are looking back five years into Germany, into a room in which Hitler and Goering are talking over an approaching invasion of a country called Austria. I might have believed I was crazy when I first found this alone, but not now!\"  Maybe we were both crazy. Maybe he was wrong. But then and there I believed him, and I knew that somehow, in some wild, impossible fashion, that belfry on Stoddard's asinine house had become a door leading through space and time, back five years into Germany, into the same room where Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering planned the conquest of Austria!  Stoddard was taking something out of his pocket.  \"Now that you're here I can try it,\" he said. \"I didn't dare do so before, since I felt I couldn't trust my own mind alone in the thing.\"  I looked at what he held in his hands. A stone, tied to a long piece of string.  \"What's that for?\" I demanded.  \"I want to see if that veil, that gray fog door, can be penetrated,\" he hissed.         *       *       *       *       *  Stoddard was swinging the stone on a string in a sharp arc now. And suddenly he released it, sending it sailing through the grayish aperture in the ceiling, straight into the belfry, or rather, the big room.  I saw and heard the stone on the string hit the marble floor of that room. Then, just as sharply, Stoddard jerked it back, yanking it into the attic again.  The result in the room beyond the fog sheet was instantaneous. Goering wheeled from the map on the wall, glaring wildly around the room. A pistol was in his hand.  Hitler had half risen behind that ornate desk, and was searching the vast, otherwise unoccupied room wildly with his eyes.  Of course neither saw anything. Stoddard, breathing excitedly at my side, had pulled the stone back into our section of time and space. But his eyes were gleaming.  \"It can be done,\" he whispered fiercely. \"It can be crossed!\"  \"But what on--\" I started. He cut me off with a wave of his hand, pointing back to the gray screen covering the hole in the ceiling.  Goering had put the pistol back in the holster at his side, and was grinning sheepishly at der Fuehrer, who was resuming his seat behind the desk in confused and angry embarrassment.  The voices picked up again.  \"They're saying how silly, to be startled by a sound,\" Stoddard hissed in my ear.  Then he grabbed my arm. \"But come, we can't wait any longer. Something has to be done immediately.\"  He was pulling me away from the rent in the ceiling, away from the door that had joined our time and space to the time and space of a world and scene five years ago.  As we emerged from the attic and started blinkingly down the steps, Stoddard almost ran ahead of me.  \"We must hurry,\" he said again and again.  \"To where?\" I demanded bewilderedly. \"Hadn't we better do something about th--\"  \"Exactly,\" Stoddard panted. \"We're really going to do something about that phenomenon in the belfry. We're going to the first place in two where we can buy two rifles, quick!\"  \"Rifles?\" I gasped, still not getting it.  \"For that little moustached swine up there,\" Stoddard said, pointing toward the attic. \"If a stone can cross that gray barrier, so can bullets. We are both going to draw bead on Adolf Hitler in the year of 1938, and thus avert this hell he's spread since then. With two of us firing, we can't miss.\"  And then, of course, I got it. It was incredible, impossible. But that gray screen covering the rent in the attic ceiling upstairs wasn't impossible. I'd seen it. Neither was the room behind it, the room where the belfry was supposed to be, but where Adolf Hitler's inner sanctum was instead. I'd seen that, too. So was it impossible that we'd be able to eliminate the chief cause of the world's trouble by shooting accurately back across time and space?  At that moment I didn't think so!  Our mad clattering dash down the attic steps, and then down to the first floor brought Mrs. Stoddard up from the basement. She looked frightenedly from her husband to me, then back to him again.  \"What's wrong?\" she quavered.  \"Nothing,\" Stoddard said,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32900"],["title","Rats in the Belfry (#3)"],["body"," pushing her gently but quickly aside as we dashed for the door.  \"But, George!\" Mrs. Stoddard shrilled behind us. We heard her footsteps hurrying toward the door, even as we were out of it.  \"My car,\" I yelled. \"It's right in front. I know the closest place where we can get the guns!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Stoddard and I piled into the car like a pair of high school kids when the last bell rings. Then I was gunning the motor, while out of the corner of my eye I could see Stoddard's wife running down the front steps shouting shrilly after us.  We jumped from the curb like a plane from a catapult, doing fifty by my quick shift to second gear. Then we were tearing the quiet streets of Mayfair's second subdivision apart with the noise of a blasting horn and a snarling motor.  It was ten minutes later when I screeched to a stop in front of the sports and gun store I'd remembered existed in Mayfair's first subdivision. The clerk was amazed at the wild speed with which we raced in, grabbed the guns, threw the money on the counter, and dashed out.  We must have looked like something out of a gangster movie as we raced back to Stoddard's place.  I was doing the driving, and Stoddard had clambered in beside me, both rifles, and several cartridge packages in his hands. He was rocking back and forth in mad impatience, as if by rocking he could increase our speed. The expression on his face was positively bloodthirsty.  And then we heard the sirens behind us. Shrill, coming up like comet wails in spite of our own speed.  \"Oh, God!\" Stoddard groaned. \"Police!\"  I squinted up into my rear vision mirror. We were less than two blocks from the Stoddard house, now, and the thought of being overhauled by police at the juncture was sickening, unbearable even to contemplate.  And then I saw the reason for the sirens. Saw them in the rear vision mirror. Two fire engines, one a hook and ladder outfit, the other a hose truck!  \"It's all right,\" I yelped. \"It's only two fire trucks!\"  \"Thank God!\" Stoddard gasped.  We were a block from his place now, with only one corner left to turn before we'd see the mad architectural monstrosity he called him home; before we'd see the crazy belfry which held the salvation of the world in its screwballish, queer-angled lines.  And then the fire trucks and the sirens were nearer and louder, less than a block behind us. At that instant we turned the corner and came into full view of the Stoddard place.  It was a mass of flames, utterly, roaringly ablaze!  [Illustration: It was tragedy! The house was in flames; the rats would escape....]  I almost drove us off the street and into a tree. And by the time I'd gotten a grip on myself, we were just a few houses away from the blazing inferno of Stoddard's crazy quilt dwelling.  I stopped by the curb, and clambered out of the car onto knees which would scarcely support me. My stomach was turning over and over in an apparently endless series of nauseating somersaults.  Stoddard, white-faced, frozen, stood there beside me, clutching the guns and the cartridge boxes foolishly in his hands.  Then someone was running up to us. Running and crying sobbingly, breathlessly. It was Stoddard's wife.  The fire trucks screeched to a stop before the blazing building at that instant, and her first words were drowned in the noise they made.  \"... just drying out some clothes, George,\" she sobbed. \"Just drying them out and turned on the furnace to help dry them. You left like that, and I got frightened. I ran to a neighbor's. The explosion and fire started not five minutes later.\"  Sickly, I thought of the naphtha Stoddard had piled near his boiler. I didn't say anything, though, for I knew he was thinking of it also.  He dropped the guns and cartridge boxes, and in a tight, strained voice, while putting his arms comfortingly around his wife, said: \"That's all right, Laura. It wasn't your fault. We'll have another house like this. So help me God, _just like this_!\"         *       *       *       *       *  It has been six months now since Stoddard's architectural eyesight burned to the ground. He started rebuilding immediately after that. I turned over all the drafts my company made from his first crude \"plans,\" and he handed them to the supervisor of the construction company he bought out. You see, he took every dime he owned, sold out his insurance business, and has gone into the building game in dead earnest.  He explained it to me this way.  \"I couldn't go on having house after house built and torn down on the same spot, Kermit. It would break me in no time. This way, with my own company to construct the house every time, I'll save about half each time.\"  \"Then you're going to build precisely the same house?\" I demanded.  His jaw went hard, and he peered from behind his spectacles with the intense glare of a fanatic. For once he didn't look like Mr. Suburbanite.  \"You know damned well I am,\" he said. \"And until it is _precisely_ the same as the first, I'll keep tearing 'em down and putting 'em up again. I don't care if I have to build a thousand to do it, right on this spot!\"  Of course I knew what he meant by precisely the same. And I wondered what on earth the odds were he was bucking. Through chance and a mad combination of angles, that time and space door had appeared the first time. But it might have been hanging on the tiniest atom of a fractional difference.  Stoddard has already finished his second house, and although it _looks_ exactly like the monstrosity I first built for him, it can't be _precisely_ like it. For he didn't get the gray shrouded door when he poked a hole in the attic ceiling and looked up into the second crazy belfry. All he saw was the belfry.  Tomorrow he starts tearing down to build another, and pretty soon people are going to be certain he's crazy.  As a matter of fact, they'll soon be pretty sure I'm loony also. For of course I can't help going over there now and then to sort of lend a hand...."]]]
