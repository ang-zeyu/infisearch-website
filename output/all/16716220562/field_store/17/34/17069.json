One end of it was fastened to the mast, and to the hook hanging from the other end the master-at-arms secured himself. The hand on the dial plate moved a certain distance and stopped at seventeen pounds. The expression on the Irishman's face was something awful to behold.  \"Does this machine tell the thruth?\" he inquired in a tearful voice.  We assured him it was absolutely correct. He only weighed seventeen pounds.  \"Oh, howly Mother of Mercy!\" yelled Flathootly. \"Consumption has me by the back of the neck. I've lost a hundred and sixty pounds in three days. Oh, sir, for the love of heaven, take me back to me mother. I'm kilt entoirely.\"  It was some time before Flathootly could understand that his lightness of weight was due to the lesser-sized world he was continually arriving upon, together with centrifugal gravity, and that we all suffered from his affliction of being each \"less than half a man\" as he termed it. The weighing of the weights wherewith he had weighed himself proved conclusively that the depreciation in gravity applied equally to everything around us.  The extreme lightness of our bodies, and the fact that our muscles had been used to move about ten times our then weight, was the cause of our wonderful buoyancy.  The sailors began leaping from the ship to a large rock that rose out of the water about half a mile off. Their agility was marvellous, and Flathootly covered himself with glory in leaping over the ship hundreds of feet in the air and alighting on the same spot on deck again.  Their officers and scientific staff remained on deck as became their dignity, although tempted to try their agility like the sailors.  Flathootly surprised us by leaping on a yardarm and exclaiming: \"Gintlemen, I tell ye what it is, I'm no weight at all.\"  \"How do you make that out?\" said the professor.  \"Well, Oi've been thinking,\" said he, \"that, as you say, we're in the middle of the two wurrlds. Now it stands to sense that the wan wurrld, I mane the sun up there, is pullin' us up an' the t'other wurrld is pullin' us down, an' as both wurrlds is pulling aqually, why av corse we don't amount to no weight at all. How could I turn fifteen summersaults at wance if I was any weight? That shows yer weighing machine is all wrang again.\"  \"How can you stand on the deck if you are no weight?\" inquired the professor.  \"Why, I'm only pressing me feet on the boards,\" said the Irishman; \"look here!\" So saying, he leaped from the yard and revolved in the air at least twenty times before alighting on the deck.  \"Now,\" said the professor, \"I'll explain why you only weigh seventeen pounds as indicated by the spring-balance. We have sailed, down the gulf 500 miles, haven't we?\"  \"Yis, sorr.\"  \"And here we are sailing upside down on the inside roof of the world----\"  \"Sailin' upside down? Indeed, sorr, an' ye can't make me believe that, for shure I'm shtandin' on me feet like yourself, head uppermost.\"  \"Well, whether you believe it or not, we are sailing upside down, just as ships going to Australia sail upside down as compared with ships sailing the North Atlantic. But the point of gravity is this: Here we are surrounded on all sides by the shell of the earth, which attracts equally in all directions. Hence all objects in the interior world have no weight as regards whatever thickness of the earth's shell surrounds them. You see, weight is caused by an object having the world on one side of it. Thus both the world and the object attract each other according to the density and distance apart. What we call a pound weight is a mass of matter attracted by the earth on its surface with a force equal to the weight of sixteen ounces. A pound weight on the surface of the earth weighs sixteen ounces, and all the mighty volume of our planet, with all its mountains, continents and seas, weighs only sixteen ounces on the surface of a pound weight. The earth may still weigh many millions of tons as regards the sun, but as regards a pound weight it only weighs sixteen ounces.\"  \"That is an illustration of Flathootly's mental calibre,\" said Captain Wallace. \"He only believes what his brain can accommodate in the way of knowledge.\"  \"God bless the captain,\" said Flathootly, \"I'm shure his brain is as big as mine any day in the week.\"  \"Now,\" continued the astronomer, \"it seems to me that the substances of the earth, rocks, metals, and water, have, under the influence of centrifugal gravity, massed themselves very thickly at the equator or point of greatest motion, and stretch toward the poles in a gradually-lessening mass until the polar gulfs are reached. Thus the earth's shell resembles a musk-melon with the inside cleaned out.\"  \"It makes me mouth wather to think of it,\" said Flathootly.  \"Now, listen,\" said the astronomer; \"we are also under the influence of the earth's centrifugal motion, and wherever we are on the interior surface we swing round our circle of latitude in twenty-four hours, and thus men, ship, and ocean are held up against the interior vault like a boy being able to hold water in a vertical position at the bottom of the pail he swings round him at the end of a cord.\"  \"Don't you think, professor,\" I inquired, \"we will become heavier as we approach the region of greatest motion under the equator?\"  \"I don't think so,\" he replied, \"for the ocean around the poles has naturally gravitated to the internal as well as to the external equator, to restore the equilibrium of gravity. The reason why a man does not weigh less on the external equator than at the poles, although flying around at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, is that the deeper ocean, that is, the extra twenty-six miles that the earth is thicker on the equator, counterbalances by its attraction the loss of weight due to the rapid centrifugal motion, and so preserves in all objects on the earth a uniform weight.\"  \"The whole thing,\" said Flathootly, \"is as clear as mud. I'm glad to know, sorr, I haven't lost me entire constitution at all evints, an' if I can only carry home what weight I've got lift I'll make a fortune in a dime museum.\"     CHAPTER IX.  AFLOAT ON THE INTERIOR OCEAN.   As the _Polar King_ sped southward over the interior sea the wonders of the strange world we had discovered began to dawn upon us. The colossal vault rose more and more above us and the sun threw his mild and vertical rays directly upon ship and sea, producing a most delightful climate. The ocean had a temperature of 75 degrees Fahr. and the air 85 degrees. We were absolutely sailing upside down to an inhabitant of the outer sphere, yet we seemed to ourselves to be sailing naturally erect on the sea with the sun above us.  Our first experience in the internal sphere was that of a sudden storm. The sun grew dark and appeared like a disc of sombre gold. The ocean was lashed by a furious hurricane into incredible mountains of water. Every crest of the waves seemed a mass of yellow flame. The internal heavens were rent open with gulfs of sulphur-colored fire, while the thunder reverberated with terrible concussions. The ship would spin upon the water as though every wave were a whirlpool. A golden-yellow phosphorescence covered the ocean. The water boiled in maddening eddies of lemon-colored seas, while from the hurricane decks streamed cataracts of saffron fire. The lightning, like streaks of molten gold, hurled its burning darts into the sea. Everything bore the glow of amber-colored fire. The sailors congratulated themselves on the shelter provided by the deck overhead. The motion of the ship exceeded all former experiences, for it leaped and plunged in a terrific manner. It was a question whether we would survive the storm or not, so violent was the shaking up both ship and men received. Fortunately, the loss of weight in everything, which was the cause of the rapid motion, permitted no more damage than would be caused by a lesser storm on heavier objects.  The professor stated that he believed the tempest was occasioned by a polar tidal wave of air rushing into the interior sphere, to supply the exhaustion caused by outgoing warm currents, owing perhaps to a periodical overheating of the air by the internal sun. When a certain volume of the air was expelled, so that it could no longer resist external pressure, then the external air rushed down the polar gulf, creating by meeting warm outward-flowing currents cyclones such as we were then experiencing.  By degrees the storm abated, the sea grew calm, the heavens above us became clearer, and the sun assumed the rose-color he first presented to our gaze, standing right in the zenith.  The only damage done to the crew was a few broken limbs and some severe bruises. The ship had lost several spars, and one of her boats was blown out of its lashings on deck and was lost.  It was a week since we had left the outer world, and what a change had occurred in that short space of time! The excitement had been so intense that not a man of us had slept during that period, and as for meals, we had forgotten about them altogether.  A general order was given the cooks to prepare a banquet to duly inaugurate our discovery of the new world. Both officers and men, including myself, sat down at the same table, where we satisfied the cravings of a week's hunger.  I expressed my heartfelt pleasure in the safety of the crew and ship so far in making so tremendous a discovery. I relied on the courage and loyalty of the crew for still further explorations in the strange and mysterious planet we had discovered. I declared that those who shared the dangers of the expedition would also share in whatever reward fortune might bestow upon us.  It is needless to say such sentiments were enthusiastically applauded.  I praised my able coadjutor, Captain Wallace, without whose skilful seamanship not a soul of us could ever have reached that secret world. \"It was he,\" said I, \"who has guided us"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32827"],["title","Think Yourself to Death (#0)"],["body","YOURSELF TO DEATH                         A \"JOHNNY MAYHEM\" ADVENTURE                               By C.

Johnny, who wears different bodies the way ordinary people wear clothes, is one of the most fascinating series characters in science fiction._]   When he reached Ophiuchus, Johnny Mayhem was wearing the body of an elderly Sirian gentleman.  Nothing could have been more incongruous. The Sirian wore a pince-nez, a dignified two-piece jumper in a charcoal color, sedate two-tone boots and a black string-tie.  The loiterers in the street near the Galactic Observer's building looked, and pointed, and laughed. Using the dignity of the dead Sirian, whose body he wore like other people wear clothing, Johnny Mayhem ignored them. They had a point, of course. It was hot and humid on Ophiuchus IX. The loiterers in the dusty, evil-smelling streets wore nothing but loin cloths.  Mayhem went inside the building, which was air-conditioned. Probably it was the only air-conditioned structure on the entire planet. Mayhem dabbed at his Sirian forehead gratefully, mopping at sweat. As near as he could figure, his life expectancy in this body was down to three days, Earth style. He wondered fleetingly why the Galactic League had sent him here to Ophiuchus. He shrugged, knowing he would find out soon enough.  The Galactic Observer on Ophiuchus IX, a middle-aged Indian from Bombay named Kovandaswamy, wore an immaculate white linen loin cloth on his plump body and a relieved smile on his worried face when Mayhem entered his office. The two men shook hands.  \"So you're Mayhem?\" Kovandaswamy said in English. \"They told me to expect you, sir. Pardon my staring, but I've never been face to face with a legend before. I'm impressed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mayhem laughed. \"You'll get over it.\"  \"Well, at least as a Sirian gentleman, you're not very prepossessing. That helps.\"  \"It wasn't my idea. It never is.\"  \"I know. I know that, sir.\" Kovandaswamy got up nervously from his desk and paced across the room. \"Do you know anything about Ophiuchus IX, Mayhem?\"  \"Not much. It's one of the Forgotten Worlds, isn't it?\"  \"Precisely, sir. Ophiuchus IX is one of scores of interstellar worlds colonized in the first great outflux from Earth.\"  \"You mean during the population pressure of the 24th century?\"  \"Exactly. Then Ophiuchus IX, like the other Forgotten Worlds, was all but forgotten. As you know, Mayhem, the first flux of colonization receded like a wave, inertia set in, and the so-called Forgotten Worlds became isolated from the rest of the galaxy for generations. Only in the past fifty years are we finding them again, one by one. Ophiuchus IX is typical, isolated from the galaxy at large by a dust cloud that--\"  \"I know. I came through it.\"  \"It was colonized originally with Indians from southern and eastern India, on Earth. That's why the Galactic League appointed me Observer. I'm an Indian. These people--well, they're what my people might have developed into if they'd lived for hundreds of years in perfect isolation.\"  \"What's the trouble?\"  Kovandaswamy answered with a question of his own. \"You are aware of the Galactic League's chief aim?\"  \"Sure. To see that no outworld, however small or distant, is left in isolation. Is that what you mean?\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Kovandaswamy. \"Their reason is obvious. For almost a thousand years now the human race has outpaced its social and moral development with development in the physical sciences. For almost a thousand years mankind has had the power to destroy itself. In isolation this is possible. With mutual interchange of ideas, it is extremely unlikely. Thus, in the interests of human survival, the Galactic League tries to thwart isolated development. So far, the Forgotten Worlds have cooperated. But Ophiuchus IX is an exception.\"  \"And the League wants me to find out why?\"  \"Precisely.\"  \"How are they thwarting--\"  Kovandaswamy was sweating despite the air-conditioning, despite his almost-naked state. \"You have the right to turn this mission down, of course. The League told me that.\"  \"I'm here,\" Mayhem said simply.  \"Very well, sir. Sooner or later, every outworlder who ventures out among the Ophiuchans kills himself.\"  \"I guess I didn't hear you. Did you say kills himself?\"  \"Suicide, Mayhem. Exactly.\"  \"But how can you blame--\"  \"Like their ancestors from the Earthian sub-continent of India, Mayhem, the Ophiuchans are mystics. The trance, the holy man who sits in contemplation of his navel, the World Spirit--these are the things of their culture most important to them. Mayhem, did you ever see a hundred holy men of India working together?\"  \"Usually they don't work together.\"  \"Precisely, sir. Precisely. Here on Ophiuchus, they do. And not merely a hundred. All of them. Virtually all of them. Working together, their minds in trance, unified, seeking their World Spirit, they can do amazing things.\"  \"Like mentally forcing the outworlders to kill themselves?\"  \"Yes, sir. Legally, they are innocent. Morally, they do not recognize the outworlders as equals of themselves. The League wants to know what they are trying to hide. It could be a threat to peace and--existence.\"  \"You have a body for me?\" Johnny would be ready with that provided.         *       *       *       *       *  If anyone but Johnny Mayhem had asked that question, Kovandaswamy would not have known what he was talking about, or would have thought him insane, or both. But Johnny Mayhem was, of course, the legandary Man Without a Body. How many corporeal shells had he inhabited in the past half dozen years? He shrugged, not remembering. He couldn't remain in one body more than a month: it would mean the final death of his _elan_, his bodiless sentience. So far he had avoided that death.  The Galactic League would help him if it could. Every world which had a human population and a Galactic League post, however small, must have a body in cold storage, waiting for Johnny Mayhem if his services were required. But no one knew exactly under what circumstances the Galactic League Council, operating from the hub of the Galaxy, might summon Mayhem. And only a very few people, including those at the Hub and the Galactic League Firstmen on civilized worlds and Observers on primitive worlds, knew the precise mechanism of Mayhem's coming. To others it was a weird mystery.  Johnny Mayhem, bodiless sentience. Mayhem--Johnny Marlow then--who had been chased from Earth, a pariah and a criminal, almost seven years ago, who had been mortally wounded on a wild planet deep within the Saggitarian Swarm, whose life had been saved--after a fashion--by the white magic of the planet. Mayhem, doomed now to possible immortality as a bodiless sentience, an _elan_, which could occupy and activate a fresh corpse or one which had been frozen properly ... an _elan_ doomed to wander eternally because it could not remain in one body for more than a month without body and _elan_ perishing. Mayhem, who had dedicated his strange, lonely life to the service of the Galactic League because a normal life and normal social relations were not possible for him....  \"Then you'll do it?\" Kovandaswamy asked on Ophiuchus IX. \"Even though you realize we can give you no official help not only because the Galactic League approves of your work unofficially but can't sanction it officially, but because an outworlder can't set his foot outside this building for long or off the spacefield without risking death....\"  \"By suicide?\"  \"Yes. I'm practically a prisoner in Galactic League Headquarters, as is my staff. You see--\"  \"What about the body?\"  Kovandaswamy looked at him nervously. \"A native, Mayhem. A native won't be molested, you see.\"  \"That figures. What kind of native?\"  \"In top shape, sir. Healthy, young, in the prime of life you might say.\"  \"Then what's bothering you?\"  \"Nothing. Nothing, sir.\"  \"Your technicians are ready?\"  \"Yes, sir. And vowed to secrecy.\"  Mayhem found a tiny capsule in the pocket of his Sirian jumper, and popped it in his mouth.  \"What--what's that?\" Kovandaswamy asked.  Mayhem swallowed. \"Curare,\" he said.  \"Curare! A poison!\"  \"Paralysis,\" said Mayhem quickly. \"Muscular paralysis. You die because you stop breathing. Painless ... and....\"  \"But--\"  \"Call your technicians ... new body ... ready....\" Gasping, the Sirian gentleman, hardly Johnny Mayhem now, fell to the floor.  Trembling, Kovandaswamy pressed a button on his desk. A few moments later, two white-coated technicians entered the office.  \"Project M,\" Kovandaswamy said.  Grimly the technicians went to work.         *       *       *       *       *  Mayhem awoke.  Ordinarily it was his _elan_ alone which journeyed between the worlds, his _elan_ which was fed the information it would need in hypno-sleep while the frozen body was thawed out. Sometimes, however, he came the normal way in a body which still had some of its thirty days left, as he had come to Ophiuchus IX in the Sirian gentleman.  Darkness. The body felt young and healthy. Mayhem wondered vaguely how it had died, then decided it did not really matter. For the next thirty days the body would live again, as Johnny Mayhem.  Recessed lighting glowed at the juncture of walls and ceiling. Mayhem was reclining on a cot. A loin cloth and a large shawl had been laid out for him. On the far wall of the room was a tinted mirror. Mayhem got up and went over there.  What his new body looked like hardly mattered, he told himself. Youth, health, strength--these were important. He could sense them internally. He could....  He stared at the image in the mirror. His face turned beet red. He went for the shawl and the loin cloth and put them on."]]]
