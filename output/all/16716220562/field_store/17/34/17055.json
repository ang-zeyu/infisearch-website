We have heard on the undoubted authority of ear and eyewitnesses, that in a neighbouring province there is a church where the psalms are sung to a barrel-organ, but unfortunately the psalm tunes come in the middle of the set, and the jigs and waltzes have to be played through before the psalm can start.  Just so is it with Darwinism and all similar theories.  All his fantasias, as we saw in a late article, are made to come round at last to religious questions, with which really and truly they have nothing to do, but were it not for their supposed effect upon religion, no one would waste his time in reading about the possibility of Polar bears swimming about and catching flies so long that they at last get the fins they wish for.    Darwin on Species [From the _Press_, 21 February, 1863.]                         To the Editor of the _Press_.  Sir—In two of your numbers you have already taken notice of Darwin’s theory of the origin of species; I would venture to trespass upon your space in order to criticise briefly both your notices.  The first is evidently the composition of a warm adherent of the theory in question; the writer overlooks all the real difficulties in the way of accepting it, and, caught by the obvious truth of much that Darwin says, has rushed to the conclusion that all is equally true.  He writes with the tone of a partisan, of one deficient in scientific caution, and from the frequent repetition of the same ideas manifest in his dialogue one would be led to suspect that he was but little versed in habits of literary composition and philosophical argument.  Yet he may fairly claim the merit of having written in earnest.  He has treated a serious subject seriously according to his lights; and though his lights are not brilliant ones, yet he has apparently done his best to show the theory on which he is writing in its most favourable aspect.  He is rash, evidently well satisfied with himself, very possibly mistaken, and just one of those persons who (without intending it) are more apt to mislead than to lead the few people that put their trust in them.  A few will always follow them, for a strong faith is always more or less impressive upon persons who are too weak to have any definite and original faith of their own.  The second writer, however, assumes a very different tone.  His arguments to all practical intents and purposes run as follows:—  Old fallacies are constantly recurring.  Therefore Darwin’s theory is a fallacy.  They come again and again, like tunes in a barrel-organ.  Therefore Darwin’s theory is a fallacy.  Hallam made a mistake, and in his _History of the Middle Ages_, p. 398, he corrects himself.  Therefore Darwin’s theory is wrong.  Dr. Darwin in the last century said the same thing as his son or grandson says now—will the writer of the article refer to anything bearing on natural selection and the struggle for existence in Dr. Darwin’s work?—and a foolish nobleman said something foolish about monkey’s tails. Therefore Darwin’s theory is wrong.  Giordano Bruno was burnt in the year 1600 A.D.; he was a Pantheist; therefore Darwin’s theory is wrong.  And finally, as a clinching argument, in one of the neighbouring settlements there is a barrel-organ which plays its psalm tunes in the middle of its jigs and waltzes.  After this all lingering doubts concerning the falsehood of Darwin’s theory must be at an end, and any person of ordinary common sense must admit that the theory of development by natural selection is unwarranted by experience and reason.  The articles conclude with an implied statement that Darwin supposes the Polar bear to swim about catching flies for so long a period that at last it gets the fins it wishes for.  Now, however sceptical I may yet feel about the truth of all Darwin’s theory, I cannot sit quietly by and see him misrepresented in such a scandalously slovenly manner.  What Darwin does say is that sometimes diversified and changed habits may be observed in individuals of the same species; that is that there are eccentric animals just as there are eccentric men.  He adduces a few instances and winds up by saying that “in North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching—almost like a whale—insects in the water.”  This and nothing more.  (See pp. 201 and 202.)  Because Darwin says that a bear of rather eccentric habits happened to be seen by Hearne swimming for hours and catching insects almost like a whale, your writer (with a carelessness hardly to be reprehended in sufficiently strong terms) asserts by implication that Darwin supposes the whale to be developed from the bear by the latter having had a strong desire to possess fins.  This is disgraceful.  I can hardly be mistaken in supposing that I have quoted the passage your writer alludes to.  Should I be in error, I trust he will give the reference to the place in which Darwin is guilty of the nonsense that is fathered upon him in your article.  It must be remembered that there have been few great inventions in physics or discoveries in science which have not been foreshadowed to a certain extent by speculators who were indeed mistaken, but were yet more or less on the right scent.  Day is heralded by dawn, Apollo by Aurora, and thus it often happens that a real discovery may wear to the careless observer much the same appearance as an exploded fallacy, whereas in fact it is widely different.  As much caution is due in the rejection of a theory as in the acceptation of it.  The first of your writers is too hasty in accepting, the second in refusing even a candid examination.  Now, when the _Saturday Review_, the _Cornhill Magazine_, _Once a Week_, and _Macmillan’s Magazine_, not to mention other periodicals, have either actually and completely as in the case of the first two, provisionally as in the last mentioned, given their adherence to the theory in question, it may be taken for granted that the arguments in its favour are sufficiently specious to have attracted the attention and approbation of a considerable number of well-educated men in England.  Three months ago the theory of development by natural selection was openly supported by Professor Huxley before the British Association at Cambridge.  I am not adducing Professor Huxley’s advocacy as a proof that Darwin is right (indeed, Owen opposed him tooth and nail), but as a proof that there is sufficient to be said on Darwin’s side to demand more respectful attention than your last writer has thought it worth while to give it.  A theory which the British Association is discussing with great care in England is not to be set down by off-hand nicknames in Canterbury.  To those, however, who do feel an interest in the question, I would venture to give a word or two of advice.  I would strongly deprecate forming a hurried opinion for or against the theory.  Naturalists in Europe are canvassing the matter with the utmost diligence, and a few years must show whether they will accept the theory or no.  It is plausible; that can be decided by no one.  Whether it is true or no can be decided only among naturalists themselves.  We are outsiders, and most of us must be content to sit on the stairs till the great men come forth and give us the benefit of their opinion.                                  I am, Sir,                                                      Your obedient servant,                                                                      A. M.    Darwin on Species [From the _Press_, March 14th, 1863.]                         To the Editor of the _Press_.  Sir—A correspondent signing himself “A. M.” in the issue of February 21st says:—“Will the writer (of an article on barrel-organs) refer to anything bearing upon natural selection and the struggle for existence in Dr. Darwin’s work?”  This is one of the trade forms by which writers imply that there is no such passage, and yet leave a loophole if they are proved wrong.  I will, however, furnish him with a passage from the notes of Darwin’s _Botanic Garden_:—  “I am acquainted with a philosopher who, contemplating this subject, thinks it not impossible that the first insects were anthers or stigmas of flowers, which had by some means loosed themselves from their parent plant; and that many insects have gradually in long process of time been formed from these, some acquiring wings, others fins, and others claws, from their ceaseless efforts to procure their food or to secure themselves from injury.  The anthers or stigmas are therefore separate beings.”  This passage contains the germ of Mr. Charles Darwin’s theory of the origin of species by natural selection:—  “Analogy would lead me to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from one prototype.”  Here are a few specimens, his illustrations of the theory:—  “There seems to me no great difficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a swim-bladder into a lung or organ used exclusively for respiration.”  “A swim-bladder has apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung.”  “We must be cautious in concluding that a bat could not have been formed by natural selection from an animal which at first could only glide through the air.”  “I can see no insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membrane-connected fingers and forearm of the galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection, and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would convert it into a bat.”  “The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of a porpoise, and leg of a horse, the same number of vertebræ forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant, and innumerable other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications.”  I do not mean to go through your correspondent’s letter,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3279"],["title","Canterbury Pieces (#4)"],["body","“I could hardly reprehend in sufficiently strong terms” (and all that sort of thing) the perversion of what I said about Giordano Bruno.  But “ex uno disce omnes”—I am, etc.,                                                             “THE SAVOYARD.”    Darwin on Species [From the _Press_, 18 March, 1863.]                         To the Editor of the _Press_.  Sir—The “Savoyard” of last Saturday has shown that he has perused Darwin’s _Botanic Garden_ with greater attention than myself.  I am obliged to him for his correction of my carelessness, and have not the smallest desire to make use of any loopholes to avoid being “proved wrong.”  Let, then, the “Savoyard’s” assertion that Dr. Darwin had to a certain extent forestalled Mr. C. Darwin stand, and let my implied denial that in the older Darwin’s works passages bearing on natural selection, or the struggle for existence, could be found, go for nought, or rather let it be set down against me.  What follows?  Has the “Savoyard” (supposing him to be the author of the article on barrel-organs) adduced one particle of real argument the more to show that the real Darwin’s theory is wrong?  The elder Darwin writes in a note that “he is acquainted with a philosopher who thinks it not impossible that the first insects were the anthers or stigmas of flowers, which by some means, etc. etc.”  This is mere speculation, not a definite theory, and though the passage above as quoted by the “Savoyard” certainly does contain the germ of Darwin’s theory, what is it more than the crudest and most unshapen germ?  And in what conceivable way does this discovery of the egg invalidate the excellence of the chicken?  Was there ever a great theory yet which was not more or less developed from previous speculations which were all to a certain extent wrong, and all ridiculed, perhaps not undeservedly, at the time of their appearance? There is a wide difference between a speculation and a theory.  A speculation involves the notion of a man climbing into a lofty position, and descrying a somewhat remote object which he cannot fully make out.  A theory implies that the theorist has looked long and steadfastly till he is clear in his own mind concerning the nature of the thing which he is beholding.  I submit that the “Savoyard” has unfairly made use of the failure of certain speculations in order to show that a distinct theory is untenable.  Let it be granted that Darwin’s theory has been foreshadowed by numerous previous writers.  Grant the “Savoyard” his Giordano Bruno, and give full weight to the barrel-organ in a neighbouring settlement, I would still ask, has the theory of natural development of species ever been placed in anything approaching its present clear and connected form before the appearance of Mr. Darwin’s book?  Has it ever received the full attention of the scientific world as a duly organised theory, one presented in a tangible shape and demanding investigation, as the conclusion arrived at by a man of known scientific attainments after years of patient toil? The upshot of the barrel-organs article was to answer this question in the affirmative and to pooh-pooh all further discussion.  It would be mere presumption on my part either to attack or defend Darwin, but my indignation was roused at seeing him misrepresented and treated disdainfully.  I would wish, too, that the “Savoyard” would have condescended to notice that little matter of the bear.  I have searched my copy of Darwin again and again to find anything relating to the subject except what I have quoted in my previous letter.                      I am, Sir, your obedient servant,                                                                       A. M.    Darwin on Species [From the _Press_, April 11th, 1863.]                         To the Editor of the _Press_.  Sir—Your correspondent “A. M.” is pertinacious on the subject of the bear being changed into a whale, which I said Darwin contemplated as not impossible.  I did not take the trouble in any former letter to answer him on that point, as his language was so intemperate.  He has modified his tone in his last letter, and really seems open to the conviction that he may be the “careless” writer after all; and so on reflection I have determined to give him the opportunity of doing me justice.  In his letter of February 21 he says: “I cannot sit by and see Darwin misrepresented in such a scandalously slovenly manner.  What Darwin does say is ‘that SOMETIMES diversified and changed habits may be observed in individuals of the same species; that is, that there are certain eccentric animals as there are certain eccentric men.  He adduces a few instances, and winds up by saying that in North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, ALMOST LIKE A WHALE, insects in the water.’  THIS, AND NOTHING MORE, pp. 201, 202.”  Then follows a passage about my carelessness, which (he says) is hardly to be reprehended in sufficiently strong terms, and he ends with saying: “This is disgraceful.”  Now you may well suppose that I was a little puzzled at the seeming audacity of a writer who should adopt this style, when the words which follow his quotation from Darwin are (in the edition from which I quoted) as follows: “Even in so extreme a case as this, if the supply of insects were constant, and if better adapted competitors did not already exist in the country, I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered by natural selection more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale.”  Now this passage was a remarkable instance of the idea that I was illustrating in the article on “Barrel-organs,” because Buffon in his _Histoire Naturelle_ had conceived a theory of degeneracy (the exact converse of Darwin’s theory of ascension) by which the bear might pass into a seal, and that into a whale.  Trusting now to the fairness of “A. M.”  I leave to him to say whether he has quoted from the same edition as I have, and whether the additional words I have quoted are in his edition, and if so whether he has not been guilty of a great injustice to me; and if they are not in his edition, whether he has not been guilty of great haste and “carelessness” in taking for granted that I have acted in so “disgraceful” a manner.                                                            I am, Sir, etc.,                                                  “The Savoyard,” or player                                                          on Barrel-organs.  (The paragraph in question has been the occasion of much discussion.  The only edition in our hands is the third, seventh thousand, which contains the paragraph as quoted by “A. M.”  We have heard that it is different in earlier editions, but have not been able to find one.  The difference between “A. M.” and “The Savoyard” is clearly one of different editions. Darwin appears to have been ashamed of the inconsequent inference suggested, and to have withdrawn it.—Ed. the _Press_.)    Darwin on Species [From the _Press_, 22nd June, 1863.]                         To the Editor of the _Press_.  Sir—I extract the following from an article in the _Saturday Review_ of January 10, 1863, on the vertebrated animals of the Zoological Gardens.  “As regards the ducks, for example, inter-breeding goes on to a very great extent among nearly all the genera, which are well represented in the collection.  We think it unfortunate that the details of these crosses have not hitherto been made public.  The Zoological Society has existed about thirty-five years, and we imagine that evidence must have been accumulated almost enough to make or mar that part of Mr. Darwin’s well-known argument which rests on what is known of the phenomena of hybridism.  The present list reveals only one fact bearing on the subject, but that is a noteworthy one, for it completely overthrows the commonly accepted theory that the mixed offspring of different species are infertile _inter se_.  At page 15 (of the list of vertebrated animals living in the gardens of the Zoological Society of London, Longman and Co., 1862) we find enumerated three examples of hybrids between two perfectly distinct species, and even, according to modern classification, between two distinct genera of ducks, for three or four generations. There can be little doubt that a series of researches in this branch of experimental physiology, which might be carried on at no great loss, would place zoologists in a far better position with regard to a subject which is one of the most interesting if not one of the most important in natural history.”  I fear that both you and your readers will be dead sick of Darwin, but the above is worthy of notice.  My compliments to the “Savoyard.”                            Your obedient servant,  May 17th.                                                                       A. M.
