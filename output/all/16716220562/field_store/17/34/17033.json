The possibility exists. While the probability is very great that such an analysis will not be made until after we have declared ourselves, it is not a certainty. Immediately upon deducing our existence, however, the Eddorians would begin to build against us, upon the four planets and elsewhere. Since there is only one effective counter-structure possible, and since we Elders have long been alert to detect the first indications of that particular activity, we know that the situation remains unchanged. If it changes, we will call at once another full meeting of minds. Are there any other matters of moment...? If not, this conference will dissolve.\"   3. ATLANTIS  Ariponides, recently elected Faros of Atlantis for his third five-year term, stood at a window of his office atop the towering Farostery. His hands were clasped loosely behind his back. He did not really see the tremendous expanse of quiet ocean, nor the bustling harbor, nor the metropolis spread out so magnificently and so busily beneath him. He stood there, motionless, until a subtle vibration warned him that visitors were approaching his door.  \"Come in, gentlemen.... Please be seated.\" He sat down at one end of a table molded of transparent plastic. \"Psychologist Talmonides, Statesman Cleto, Minister Philamon, Minister Marxes and Officer Artomenes, I have asked you to come here personally because I have every reason to believe that the shielding of this room is proof against eavesdroppers; a thing which can no longer be said of our supposedly private television channels. We must discuss, and if possible come to some decision concerning, the state in which our nation now finds itself.  \"Each of us knows within himself exactly what he is. Of our own powers, we cannot surely know each others' inward selves. The tools and techniques of psychology, however, are potent and exact; and Talmonides, after exhaustive and rigorous examination of each one of us, has certified that no taint of disloyalty exists among us.\"  \"Which certification is not worth a damn,\" the burly Officer declared. \"What assurance do we have that Talmonides himself is not one of the ringleaders? Mind you, I have no reason to believe that he is not completely loyal. In fact, since he has been one of my best friends for over twenty years, I believe implicitly that he is. Nevertheless the plain fact is, Ariponides, that all the precautions you have taken, and any you can take, are and will be useless insofar as definite knowledge is concerned. The real truth is and will remain unknown.\"  \"You are right,\" the Psychologist conceded. \"And, such being the case, perhaps I should withdraw from the meeting.\"  \"That wouldn't help, either.\" Artomenes shook his head. \"Any competent plotter would be prepared for this, as for any other contingency. One of us others would be the real operator.\"  \"And the fact that our Officer is the one who is splitting hairs so finely could be taken to indicate which one of us the real operator could be,\" Marxes pointed out, cuttingly.  \"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!\" Ariponides protested. \"While absolute certainty is of course impossible to any finite mind, you all know how Talmonides was tested; you know that in his case there is no reasonable doubt. Such chance as exists, however, must be taken, for if we do not trust each other fully in this undertaking, failure is inevitable. With this word of warning I will get on with my report.  \"This worldwide frenzy of unrest followed closely upon the controlled liberation of atomic energy and may be--probably is--traceable to it. It is in no part due to imperialistic aims or acts on the part of Atlantis. This fact cannot be stressed too strongly. We never have been and are not now interested in Empire. It is true that the other nations began as Atlantean colonies, but no attempt was ever made to hold any one of them in colonial status against the wish of its electorate. All nations were and are sister states. We gain or lose together. Atlantis, the parent, was and is a clearing-house, a co-ordinator of effort, but has never claimed or sought authority to rule; all decisions being based upon free debate and free and secret ballot.  \"But now! Parties and factions everywhere, even in old Atlantis. Every nation is torn by internal dissensions and strife. Nor is this all. Uighar as a nation is insensately jealous of the Islands of the South, who in turn are jealous of Maya. Maya of Bantu, Bantu of Ekopt, Ekopt of Norheim, and Norheim of Uighar. A vicious circle, worsened by other jealousies and hatreds intercrossing everywhere. Each fears that some other is about to try to seize control of the entire world; and there seems to be spreading rapidly the utterly baseless belief that Atlantis itself is about to reduce all other nations of Earth to vassalage.  \"This is a bald statement of the present condition of the world as I see it. Since I can see no other course possible within the constituted framework of our democratic government, I recommend that we continue our present activities, such as the international treaties and agreements upon which we are now at work, intensifying our effort wherever possible. We will now hear from Statesman Cleto.\"  \"You have outlined the situation clearly enough, Faros. My thought, however, is that the principal cause of the trouble is the coming into being of this multiplicity of political parties, particularly those composed principally of crackpots and extremists. The connection with atomic energy is clear: since the atomic bomb gives a small group of people the power to destroy the world, they reason that it thereby confers upon them the authority to dictate to the world. My recommendation is merely a special case of yours; that every effort be made to influence the electorates of Norheim and of Uighar into supporting an effective international control of atomic energy.\"  \"You have your data tabulated in symbolics?\" asked Talmonides, from his seat at the keyboard of a calculating machine.  \"Yes. Here they are.\"  \"Thanks.\"  \"Minister Philamon,\" the Faros announced.  \"As I see it--as any intelligent man should be able to see it--the principal contribution of atomic energy to this worldwide chaos was the complete demoralization of labor,\" the gray-haired Minister of Trade stated, flatly. \"Output per man-hour should have gone up at least twenty percent, in which case prices would automatically have come down. Instead, short-sighted guilds imposed drastic curbs on production, and now seem to be surprised that as production falls and hourly wages rise, prices also rise and real income drops. Only one course is possible, gentlemen; labor _must_ be made to listen to reason. This feather-bedding, this protected loafing, this....\"  \"I protest!\" Marxes, Minister of Work, leaped to his feet. \"The blame lies squarely with the capitalists. Their greed, their rapacity, their exploitation of....\"  \"One moment, please!\" Ariponides rapped the table sharply. \"It is highly significant of the deplorable condition of the times that two Ministers of State should speak as you two have just spoken. I take it that neither of you has anything new to contribute to this symposium?\"  Both claimed the floor, but both were refused it by vote.  \"Hand your tabulated data to Talmonides,\" the Faros directed. \"Officer Artomenes?\"  \"You, our Faros, have more than intimated that our defense program, for which I am primarily responsible, has been largely to blame for what has happened,\" the grizzled warrior began. \"In part, perhaps it was--one must be blind indeed not to see the connection, and biased indeed not to admit it. But what should I have done, knowing that there is no practical defense against the atomic bomb? Every nation has them, and is manufacturing more and more. Every nation is infested with the agents of every other. Should I have tried to keep Atlantis toothless in a world bristling with fangs? And could I--or anyone else--have succeeded in doing so?\"  \"Probably not. No criticism was intended; we must deal with the situation as it actually exists. Your recommendations, please?\"  \"I have thought this thing over day and night, and can see no solution which can be made acceptable to our--or to any real--democracy. Nevertheless, I have one recommendation to make. We all know that Norheim and Uighar are the sore spots--particularly Norheim. We have more bombs as of now than both of them together. We know that Uighar's super-sonic jobs are ready. We don't know exactly what Norheim has, since they cut my Intelligence line a while back, but I'm sending over another operative--my best man, too--tonight. If he finds out that we have enough advantage in speed, and I'm pretty sure that we have, I say hit both Norheim and Uighar right then, while we can, before they hit us. And hit them hard--pulverize them. Then set up a world government strong enough to knock out any nation--including Atlantis--that will not cooperate with it. This course of action is flagrantly against all international law and all the principles of democracy, I know; and even it might not work. It is, however, as far as I can see, the only course which _can_ work.\"  \"You--we all--perceive its weaknesses.\" The Faros thought for minutes. \"You cannot be sure that your Intelligence has located all of the danger points, and many of them must be so far underground as to be safe from even our heaviest missiles. We all, including you, believe that the Psychologist is right in holding that the reaction of the other nations to such action would be both unfavorable and violent. Your report, please, Talmonides.\"  \"I have already put my data into the integrator.\" The Psychologist punched a button and the mechanism began to whir and to click. \"I have only one new fact of any importance; the name of one of the higher-ups and its corollary implication that there may be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],["title","Triplanetary (#4)"],["body"," degree of cooperation between Norheim and Uighar....\"  He broke off as the machine stopped clicking and ejected its report.  \"Look at that graph--up ten points in seven days!\" Talmonides pointed a finger. \"The situation is deteriorating faster and faster. The conclusion is unavoidable--you can see yourselves that this summation line is fast approaching unity--that the outbreaks will become uncontrollable in approximately eight days. With one slight exception--here--you will notice that the lines of organization and purpose are as random as ever. In spite of this conclusive integration I would be tempted to believe that this seeming lack of coherence was due to insufficient data--that back of this whole movement there is a carefully-set-up and completely-integrated plan--except for the fact that the factions and the nations are so evenly matched. But the data are sufficient. It is shown conclusively that no one of the other nations can possibly win, even by totally destroying Atlantis. They would merely destroy each other and our entire Civilization. According to this forecast, in arriving at which the data furnished by our Officer were prime determinants, that will surely be the outcome unless remedial measures be taken at once. You are of course sure of your facts, Artomenes?\"  \"I am sure. But you said you had a name, and that it indicated a Norheim-Uighar hookup. What is that name?\"  \"An old friend of yours....\"  \"Lo Sung!\" The words as spoken were a curse of fury.  \"None other. And, unfortunately, there is as yet no course of action indicated which is at all promising of success.\"  \"Use mine, then!\" Artomenes jumped up and banged the table with his fist. \"Let me send two flights of rockets over right now that will blow Uigharstoy and Norgrad into radioactive dust and make a thousand square miles around each of them uninhabitable for ten thousand years! If that's the only way they can learn anything, let them learn!\"  \"Sit down, Officer,\" Ariponides directed, quietly. \"That course, as you have already pointed out, is indefensible. It violates every Prime Basic of our Civilization. Moreover, it would be entirely futile, since this resultant makes it clear that every nation on Earth would be destroyed within the day.\"  \"What, then?\" Artomenes demanded, bitterly. \"Sit still here and let them annihilate us?\"  \"Not necessarily. It is to formulate plans that we are here. Talmonides will by now have decided, upon the basis of our pooled knowledge, what must be done.\"  \"The outlook is not good: not good at all,\" the Psychologist announced, gloomily. \"The only course of action which carries any promise whatever of success--and its probability is only point one eight--is the one recommended by the Faros, modified slightly to include Artomenes' suggestion of sending his best operative on the indicated mission. For highest morale, by the way, the Faros should also interview this agent before he sets out. Ordinarily I would not advocate a course of action having so little likelihood of success; but since it is simply a continuation and intensification of what we are already doing, I do not see how we can adopt any other.\"  \"Are we agreed?\" Ariponides asked, after a short silence.  They were agreed. Four of the conferees filed out and a brisk young man strode in. Although he did not look at the Faros his eyes asked questions.  \"Reporting for orders, sir.\" He saluted the Officer punctiliously.  \"At ease, sir.\" Artomenes returned the salute. \"You were called here for a word from the Faros. Sir, I present Captain Phryges.\"  \"Not orders, son ... no.\" Ariponides' right hand rested in greeting upon the captain's left shoulder, wise old eyes probed deeply into gold-flecked, tawny eyes of youth; the Faros saw, without really noticing, a flaming thatch of red-bronze-auburn hair. \"I asked you here to wish you well; not only for myself, but for all our nation and perhaps for our entire race. While everything in my being rebels against an unprovoked and unannounced assault, we may be compelled to choose between our Officer's plan of campaign and the destruction of Civilization. Since you already know the vital importance of your mission, I need not enlarge upon it. But I want you to know fully, Captain Phryges, that all Atlantis flies with you this night.\"  \"Th ... thank you, sir.\" Phryges gulped twice to steady his voice. \"I'll do my best, sir.\"  And later, in a wingless craft flying toward the airfield, young Phryges broke a long silence. \"So _that_ is the Faros ... I like him, Officer ... I have never seen him close up before ... there's something about him.... He isn't like my father, much, but it seems as though I have known him for a thousand years!\"  \"Hm ... m ... m. Peculiar. You two are a lot alike, at that, even though you don't look anything like each other. ... Can't put a finger on exactly what it is, but it's there.\" Although Artomenes nor any other of his time could place it, the resemblance was indeed there. It was in and back of the eyes; it was the \"look of eagles\" which was long later to become associated with the wearers of Arisia's Lens. \"But here we are, and your ship's ready. Luck, son.\"  \"Thanks, sir. But one more thing. If it should--if I don't get back--will you see that my wife and the baby are...?\"  \"I will, son. They will leave for North Maya tomorrow morning. They will live, whether you and I do or not. Anything else?\"  \"No, sir. Thanks. Goodbye.\"  The ship was a tremendous flying wing. A standard commercial job. Empty--passengers, even crewmen, were never subjected to the brutal accelerations regularly used by unmanned carriers. Phryges scanned the panel. Tiny motors were pulling tapes through the controllers. Every light showed green. Everything was set. Donning a water-proof coverall, he slid through a flexible valve into his acceleration-tank and waited.  A siren yelled briefly. Black night turned blinding white as the harnessed energies of the atom were released. For five and six-tenths seconds the sharp, hard, beryllium-bronze leading edge of the back-sweeping V sliced its way through ever-thinning air.  The vessel seemed to pause momentarily; paused and bucked viciously. She shuddered and shivered, tried to tear herself into shreds and chunks; but Phryges in his tank was unconcerned. Earlier, weaker ships went to pieces against the solid-seeming wall of atmospheric incompressibility at the velocity of sound; but this one was built solidly enough, and powered to hit that wall hard enough, to go through unharmed.  The hellish vibration ceased; the fantastic violence of the drive subsided to a mere shove; Phryges knew that the vessel had leveled off at its cruising speed of two thousand miles per hour. He emerged, spilling the least possible amount of water upon the polished steel floor. He took off his coverall and stuffed it back through the valve into the tank. He mopped and polished the floor with towels, which likewise went into the tank.  He drew on a pair of soft gloves and, by manual control, jettisoned the acceleration tank and all the apparatus which had made that unloading possible. This junk would fall into the ocean; would sink; would never be found. He examined the compartment and the hatch minutely. No scratches, no scars, no mars; no tell-tale marks or prints of any kind. Let the Norskies search. So far, so good.  Back toward the trailing edge then, to a small escape-hatch beside which was fastened a dull black ball. The anchoring devices went out first. He gasped as the air rushed out into near-vacuum, but he had been trained to take sudden and violent fluctuations in pressure. He rolled the ball out upon the hatch, where he opened it; two hinged hemispheres, each heavily padded with molded composition resembling sponge rubber. It seemed incredible that a man as big as Phryges, especially when wearing a parachute, could be crammed into a space so small; but that lining had been molded to fit.  This ball _had_ to be small. The ship, even though it was on a regularly-scheduled commercial flight, would be scanned intensively and continuously from the moment of entering Norheiman radar range. Since the ball would be invisible on any radar screen, no suspicion would be aroused; particularly since--as far as Atlantean Intelligence had been able to discover--the Norheimans had not yet succeeded in perfecting any device by the use of which a living man could bail out of a super-sonic plane.  Phryges waited--and waited--until the second hand of his watch marked the arrival of zero time. He curled up into one half of the ball; the other half closed over him and locked. The hatch opened. Ball and closely-prisoned man plummeted downward; slowing abruptly, with a horrible deceleration, to terminal velocity. Had the air been any trifle thicker the Atlantean captain would have died then and there; but that, too, had been computed accurately and Phryges lived.  And as the ball bulleted downward on a screaming slant, it _shrank_!  This, too, the Atlanteans hoped, was new--a synthetic which air-friction would erode away, molecule by molecule, so rapidly that no perceptible fragment of it would reach ground.  The casing disappeared, and the yielding porous lining. And Phryges, still at an altitude of over thirty thousand feet, kicked away the remaining fragments of his cocoon and, by judicious planning, turned himself so that he could see the ground, now dimly visible in the first dull gray of dawn. There was the highway, paralleling his line of flight; he wouldn't miss it more than a hundred yards.  He fought down an almost overwhelming urge to pull his rip-cord too soon. He had to wait--wait until the last possible second--because parachutes were big and Norheiman radar practically swept the ground.  Low enough at last, he pulled the ring. Z-r-r-e-e-k--WHAP! The chute banged open; his harness tightened with a savage jerk, mere seconds before his hard-sprung knees took the shock of landing.  That"]]]
