The green borders of the secondaries are never very well marked, and sometimes virtually absent.  Seven females from the same region measure: Bill, 18.5-21; Wing 117.5-129; Tail, 149-169.  One male collected in the Uele District, in a small forest tract between Faradje and Aba, is strikingly larger; wing, 134; tail 194. This example is probably referable to _A. n. narina_.   =Ceriocleptes= gen. nov. (Indicatoridæ).       Resembling _Indicator_ in its bill and general form, save for the      tail, which is composed of 12 quills, the two middle pairs of      nearly equal length, somewhat pointed and curved strongly      outwards, the next pair considerably shorter, but also pointed      and slightly curved; while the fourth, fifth and sixth are      straight, greatly narrowed, and stiffened, becoming successively      shorter, so that the outermost pair is not half so long as the      median. The tail-coverts are unusually long, those below as long      as the longest rectrices, and projecting in the fork of the tail.   =Ceriocleptes xenurus= sp. nov.       Description of type, collector's No. 5628, Congo Exp. A. M. N. H.      [Male] ad., Avakubi, Ituri District, Belgian Congo. Apr. 17,      1914.       Feathers of forehead, crown, back, and rump blackish-brown,      bordered or washed with yellowish-citrine, those of nape and      upper back whitish at the base. Sides of head lighter, shading      gradually to olive-buff on throat, breast, and sides; middle of      abdomen still lighter, ivory-yellow. Upper wing-coverts and      secondaries fuscous-black (freshly molted feathers blacker)      narrowly edged with olive-ocher. Primaries similar, but yellowish      border almost entirely lacking; both primaries and secondaries      fading to pale olive-buff on their inner edges. Under      wing-coverts colored like the breast, but with faint dusky      shaft-streaks. Feathering of flanks ivory-yellow, with strong      blackish median lines. Two middle pairs of rectrices dull      blackish, 3rd pair whitish, with a small blackish spot on the      outer edge close to the tip, and a larger concealed black spot on      the inner web towards the base; the 3 remaining pairs of      rectrices white. The long median pair of under tail-coverts      blackish, the next pair similar, but margined with whitish, the      remainder ivory-yellow with faint shaft-streaks of dark brown.      Upper tail-coverts fuscous-black, bordered with amber-yellow.[1]       The bill, nostril, and feet resemble those of _Indicator      indicator_, but the bill is somewhat stouter, while the wings and      tail are shorter. The 9th (outer) primary is intermediate in      length between the 6th and 5th; the 7th and 8th are longest.       Iris bright brown, naked edges of eyelids grayish-brown; bill      dusky-brown; feet dull grayish-green.       Length (skin), 160 mm.; wing, 93.5; tail 56; bill (culmen from      base), 13.5; metatarsus, 14.  This unique specimen was shot by the describer from a tall tree in the forest, where it was accompanied by one other of its kind. The sexual organs were somewhat enlarged; the stomach filled with beeswax, mixed with small pieces of insects. Apparently this species is not in the habit of leading men to beehives.
