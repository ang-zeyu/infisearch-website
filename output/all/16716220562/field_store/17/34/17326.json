KELSON   In preparing maps showing the geographic distribution of North American mammals we have found in the literature conflicting statements concerning the subspecific identity of several rodents. Wherever possible, we have examined the pertinent specimens. Results of our examination are given below.  Our studies have been aided by a contract (NR 161-791) between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy, and the University of Kansas. Also, a grant from the Kansas University Endowment Association has permitted field work that yielded some of the specimens used for comparison. Grateful acknowledgment is made to the persons in charge of the several collections of mammals that we have consulted in order to satisfy ourselves concerning the subspecific status of specimens from many localities.   ~Marmota flaviventer luteola~ A. H. Howell  A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 37:50, April 7, 1915) referred specimens from Bridgers Pass, Wyoming, to _Marmota flaviventer dacota_, on the basis of paler underparts because, according to the data of Howell (_op. cit._), _M. f. dacota_ and _M. f. luteola_, the contiguous subspecies, do not differ significantly in other ways. Casual comparison reveals to us no additional differences between the two. We have examined the three specimens available to Howell from Bridgers Pass (Nos. 18733/25527, 18734/25528, and 18735/25529 U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.) and find the tone of the underparts to be darker (more nearly russet) than in typical _luteola_. The tone, however, varies considerably, both individually and geographically, in _luteola_ and it is possible to match almost exactly the ventral coloration of the specimens from Bridgers Pass with that of specimens from within the geographic range of _luteola_; Nos. 160509, from Bear Creek, 8 miles west of Eagle Peak, Wyoming, 18875 and 18731/25535, from the Laramie Mts., Wyoming, and No. 203744 from Sulphur Springs, Grand County, Colorado, all in the United States Biological Surveys Collection, are examples to the point. Being influenced by the geography of the region, we therefore consider the three specimens from Bridgers Pass best referred to the subspecies _Marmota flaviventer luteola_.   ~Spermophilus variegatus grammurus~ (Say)  A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 56:147, May 18, 1938) accorded _Citellus_ [= _Spermophilus_] _variegatus utah_ Merriam a geographic range that included the Kaibab Plateau of Arizona. Durrant (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., 6:119, August 10, 1952) assigned to _S. v. grammurus_ a geographic range that included southern Utah from the eastern to the western border but in doing this did not mention the rock squirrel of the Kaibab Plateau of Arizona that also might be expected to be referable to _S. v. grammurus_. Howell (_loc. cit._) had two specimens from the Kaibab Plateau. Of these we have examined the one from Big Spring (161566 BS) and find that it lacks the darker (more tawny) head and posterior back of _C. v. utah_ and agrees with _C. v. grammurus_. On this basis we refer the rock squirrel of the Kaibab Plateau to the subspecies _Spermophilus variegatus grammurus_ (Say).   ~Tamias amoenus caurinus~ Merriam  This subspecies was named from the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. A. H. Howell, in his \"Revision of the American chipmunks\" (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:77, and fig. 5, 1929) regarded the geographic range of _Eutamias_ [= _Tamias_] _amoenus caurinus_ as the mountains of the Olympic Peninsula and most of Mt. Rainier. The geographic range of the _amoenus_ chipmunk on Mt. Rainier almost certainly is continuous with that of _T. a. ludibundus_ in the Cascade Mountains of which Mt. Rainier is a westward-projecting arm. There is no contact between the chipmunks of Mt. Rainier and those of the Olympic Peninsula; those on the Peninsula are geographically isolated from all others of the species and are separated from those on Mt. Rainier by approximately eighty miles of low-lying country, which is uninhabited by chipmunks of the species _Tamias amoenus_. Therefore, Howell's (_loc. cit._) assignment of most of the chipmunks on Mt. Rainier to _caurinus_ is open to question and Dalquest, in the \"Mammals of Washington\" (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., vol. 2, 1948) evidently thought that Howell had incorrectly identified them. On page 256 Dalquest (_op. cit._) defined the geographic range of _T. a. caurinus_ as restricted to the Olympic Peninsula and showed (fig. 81) Mt. Rainier to be in the geographic range of _T. a. ludibundus_. We would accept Dalquest's (_op. cit._) arrangement without question and also would follow it because it is the more recent one were it not for the fact that Dalquest gives no reason for his changes. To allow us to decide the matter we have compared the pertinent materials ourselves. Catalogue numbers below are of the United States National Museum, Biological Surveys Collection, and each specimen mentioned by catalogue number is an adult female which shows much wear on the fourth upper premolar.  Of _T. a. caurinus_, Nos. 241902 and 241903 are from 2 mi. SW of Mount Angeles; No. 241911 is from \"near\" head of Dosewallips River, 6000 ft., and No. 241915 is from Canyon Creek, 3 mi. S Soleduc River, 3550 ft. Of _T. a. ludibundus_, Nos. 234776 and 235018 are from Barron, 5000 ft., and No. 230685 is from Suiattle River, 6500 ft. Of specimens in question, from Mount Rainier, No. 90635 is from 6500 ft., west slope; No. 232729 is from 4900 ft., Reflection Lakes, and No. 233114 is from 5300 ft., Indian Henrys.  In comparison with _T. a. ludibundus_, _T. a. caurinus_ is grayer on most, or all, parts of the pelage, has less ochraceous on the sides, and the dark stripes on the sides of the head are narrower and less reddish (more grayish). The skull of _caurinus_ is larger in certain measurements, as shown below:  ======================================================================= Catalogue  Occipitonasal  Zygomatic  Cranial  Length of  Greatest width number     length         breadth    breadth  nasals     across upper                                                          molars ----------------------------------------------------------------------- _T. a. ludibundus_  234776        34.0        19.3        15.6        10.2        ... 235018        34.1        ....        ....        10.4        8.0 230685        33.5        18.8        15.5        10.4        7.9  Mt.

Our comparisons indicate the correctness of Howell's identification of the specimens from Glacier Basin; they more closely resemble _ludibundus_ than _caurinus_. The specimen from Reflection Lakes, however, is only one of five or six from the same place; the others were lumped by him among the 49 that he recorded from Mount Rainier under the name _caurinus_. The series from Reflection Lakes, so far as we can detect, is not unusually variable and the differences that are apparent are within the normal range of variation ascribable to season, age, and individualism. Also, the series from Reflection Lakes, to us, is not appreciably different from the other series, representing the following places on Mount Rainier: Indian Henrys, 5300 ft.; W slope Mt. Rainier, 6600 ft.; St. Andrews Park, 5500 ft.; Spray Park, 5500 ft.; Paradise Park; Muddy Fork of Cowlitz River; Sunset Park, 5000 ft.; ridge between St. Andrews Park and South Puyallup River, 6000 ft.; and Owyhigh Lakes, 5350 ft.  Collectively, or individually, where there are as many as six specimens from a place, the material from Mt. Rainier (Glacier Basin excepted) is intermediate in color between _T. a. ludibundus_ and _T. a. caurinus_ and no more closely resembles one subspecies than the other. As may be seen from the cranial measurements recorded above, specimens from Mt. Rainier, although intermediate between the two subspecies just mentioned, resemble _ludibundus_ in lesser zygomatic breadth and lesser cranial breadth (and, it may be added, in lesser dorsolateral inflation of the braincase), but resemble _caurinus_ in longer skull (occipitonasal length), longer nasals and greater breadth across the rows of upper molariform teeth.  In summary: The animals from Mount Rainier, in features of taxonomic import, are almost exactly intermediate between _T. a. caurinus_"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33578"],["title","Comments on the Taxonomy and Geographic Distribution of Some North American (#1)"],["body","_T. a. ludibundus_. Being influenced by considerations of geographic adjacency, we refer the animals on Mount Rainier to _Tamias amoenus ludibundus_ (Hollister).  Dalquest's (_op. cit._: 85) explanation of the probable origin of _Tamias amoenus caurinus_ is pertinent here. He writes: \"The chipmunks of the Olympic Mountains [_caurinus_] probably reached their present range from the Cascades. Their probable path of emigration was westward from Mt. Rainier, along the glacial outwash train of Nisqualli Glacier, to the moraine and outwash apron of the Vashon Glacier and thence to the Olympics. So similar are the chipmunks of Mt. Rainier and the Olympic Mountains that Howell (1929) included Mt. Rainier in the range of _caurinus_.\"   ~Tamias townsendii cooperi~ Baird  Some uncertainty exists concerning the subspecific identity of the Townsend Chipmunk in southern Washington because Dalquest (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:262, April 9, 1948) identified as _Tamias townsendii cooperi_ specimens that he examined from Yocolt, a place well within the geographic range of _T. t. townsendii_ as defined by A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52: fig. 7, p. 107, November 30, 1929). Dalquest (_op. cit._) referred other specimens, that he did not examine, from Mt. St. Helens (90654, 231112 and 231114 BS) to _T. t. cooperi_ although Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:109, November 20, 1929) had previously identified them as _E. t. townsendii_. By implication, and on his map, Dalquest (_op. cit._, fig. 83, p. 261) assigned to _T. t. cooperi_ still other specimens, that he had not examined, from: Government Springs, 15 mi. N Carson (230514, 230515, 230559, 230560, and 230563 BS); Stevenson (230513 and 230517 BS); and Skamania (230518 BS). Earlier, Howell (op. cit.) had listed the specimens from the three mentioned localities as _Eutamias townsendii townsendii_.  Our examination of specimens in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology from 1-1/2 mi. W Yocolt (94238 and 94239 MVZ) and from 3-1/2 mi. E and 5 mi. N Yocolt (94240-94244 MVZ) reveals that the \"average\" of the coloration is nearer to that of the paler _T. t. cooperi_ than to that of the darker _T. t. townsendii_ and indicates why Dalquest, we think correctly, identified specimens from Yocolt as _T. t. cooperi_. We have examined also the specimens in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum (catalogue numbers given above) and have compared them with specimens (comparable in age and seasonal condition of pelage) of _T. t. townsendii_ (notably a series from Lake Quinalt, Washington) and of _T. t. cooperi_ (including specimens from Bumping Lake and Blewett Pass, Washington). In color, the specimens from Mt. St. Helens are almost exactly intermediate between _T. t. cooperi_ and _T. t. townsendii_. We choose to use for them the name _T. t. townsendii_ as did Howell (_op. cit._:109). The specimens from 15 mi. N Carson, those from Stevenson and the one from Skamania agree in nearly all features of color with the relatively paler _T. t. cooperi_, as Dalquest (_op. cit._) thought they would, and we, accordingly, use for them the name _Tamias townsendii cooperi_.  In view of the findings resulting from our study of the above mentioned specimens of the Townsend Chipmunk in Washington, it seemed worthwhile to examine the material of the same species from Hood River, Oregon. Howell (_op. cit._:109) listed one specimen from there as _E. t. townsendii_, but (_op. cit.:_ fig. 7, p. 107) mapped the locality as within the geographic range of _E. t. cooperi_. The specimen (89061 BS) is a juvenile having external measurements of only 175, 80 and 31. Although the color is intermediate between that of the two subspecies concerned, greater resemblance is shown to _T. t. townsendii_. We have not examined any other specimen of the species _Tamias townsendii_ so young as No. 89061, but suspect that older specimens from the same place would be paler by a slight degree. This suspicion, and more especially the light color of an older specimen from nearby White Salmon, Washington, and the light color of two older specimens from Parkdale, Oregon, which seem to us to be referable to _T. t. cooperi_, influence us to refer the specimen from Hood River to _Tamias townsendii cooperi_ Baird.   ~Tamias townsendii townsendii~ Bachman  A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:111, November 30, 1929) referred specimens of the Townsend Chipmunk from the lower elevations on the Olympic Peninsula to _Eutamias townsendii townsendii_ but referred specimens from the central mountains on that peninsula to _Eutamias townsendii cooperi_. The subspecies _T. t. cooperi_ thus is represented as having a geographic range of two separate parts: (1) The Cascade Mountains from southern British Columbia into southern Oregon, and (2) the area of the Olympic Mountains, the latter area being entirely surrounded by the geographic range of _T. t. townsendii_. Dalquest (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:261 and 262, April 9, 1948) employed Howell's arrangement.  We have examined the specimens, in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum, from the Olympic Peninsula and fail to find significant differences in external measurements or in size or shape of skulls between specimens from the mountains (alleged _T. t. cooperi_) and those from other parts of the Peninsula (assigned to _T. t. townsendii_). Nevertheless, the specimens from the higher parts of the Olympic Mountains resemble _T. t. cooperi_ in being less ochraceous than are specimens of _T. t. townsendii_ from elsewhere on the Olympic Peninsula, and in this one respect, in series, they more closely resemble _T. t. cooperi_. Even so, the upper parts of the specimens from the mountains are darker than in _T. t. cooperi_ of the Cascades. In dark color of the superciliary stripe the specimens in question are referable to _T. t. townsendii_. The over-all gray tone, resembling that of _T. t. cooperi_, upon close inspection is found to be in considerable degree the result of wear, and the difference in grayness from _T. t. townsendii_, when specimens in comparable pelage are compared, is slight. This tendency to lighter color in specimens from higher elevations is seen in other places in Washington within the geographic range of _Tamias townsendii_. We feel, therefore, that the mentioned resemblance in color between specimens from the Olympic Mountains and those of _T. t. cooperi_ from the Cascade Mountains is not significant taxonomically. To us, all of the animals of the species _Tamias townsendii_ from the Olympic Peninsula seem best referred to the subspecies _Tamias townsendii townsendii_ Bachman.   ~Tamias striatus ohionensis~ Bole and Moulthrop  A. H. Howell (Jour. Mamm., 13:166, May 14, 1932) referred a specimen (252979 USNM) from Athens, Ohio, to _Tamias striatus fisheri_. Subsequently, Bole and Moulthrop (Sci. Publs. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:83-181, September 11, 1942) named _Tamias striatus ohionensis_ and _Tamias striatus rufescens_, both of which occur in Ohio. They (_op. cit._: 137) also excluded _T. s. fisheri_ from the state list of mammals of Ohio. The locality of Athens lies between the ranges of _T. s. ohionensis_ and _T. s. rufescens_, as outlined by referred specimens, and thus the identity of the specimen from that place was left in doubt. We have examined the specimen and among named kinds find that it most closely resembles _T. s. ohionensis_ in its less widely spreading zygomata, slender incisors and dull-colored pelage. We prefer the specimen to _T. s. ohionensis_.  The subspecific identity of specimen No. 174762 USNM, a skin only, from Nobleville, Hamilton Co., Indiana, assigned by Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:21, November 30, 1929) to _T. s. griseus_ and by Lyon (Amer. Mid. Nat., 17(1):191, January, 1936) to _T. s. fisheri_, was left in doubt by Bole and Moulthrop's (_op. cit._) assignment of specimens to _T. s. ohionensis_. Although the specimen lacks a skull and tail, on the basis of its dull-colored pelage and dark brown (anteriorly) median dorsal stripe, we identify No. 174762 as _T. s. ohionensis_. For the same reason, specimen No. 125445 USNM, from Bascom, Indiana, referred by Howell (_op. cit._:16) to _T. s. striatus_, and by Lyon (_op. cit._:191) to _T. s. fisheri_, required re-examination. The specimen appears to be an intergrade between _T. s. striatus_ and _T. s. ohionensis_; it is probably best referred to the latter subspecies which it resembles in having short nasals. In color it is intermediate, but it does not possess the narrowly spreading zygomata of _T. s. ohionensis_ and, in this respect, more nearly approaches _T. s. striatus_.  Specimen No. 13815 USNM, an alcoholic, from Wheatland, Knox Co., Indiana, was assigned by Howell (_op. cit._, 1929:21) to _T. s. griseus_ and by Lyon (_loc. cit._) to _T. s. fisheri_. Although the specimen is much faded and cannot be identified with certainty, we assign it to _T. s. ohionensis_. Allowing for fading, it seems to resemble _ohionensis_ more in the lighter color of the anterior part of the median dorsal stripe, than it does either _griseus_ or _fisheri_. We are also influenced in making this allocation by Bole and Moulthrop's (_op. cit._:137) finding intergradation between _T. s. ohionensis_ and _T. s. striatus_ in a specimen obtained at New Harmony, Posey Co., Indiana.  Howell (Jour. Mamm., 13:166, August 9, 1932) referred two specimens from Boone County, Indiana, to _T. s. fisheri_. We have examined a specimen (5675 AMNH) from that place and think it is one of the two seen by Howell. The specimen is a poorly made skin in worn winter pelage with the skull inside. Because it differs from _T. s. fisheri_ and agrees with _T. s. ohionensis_ in the color of both upper parts and underparts (comparisons made with material of comparable stage of molt), we assign it to the latter subspecies. Howell (_loc. cit._) referred specimens from Overton (57394), Wooster (57398"]]]
