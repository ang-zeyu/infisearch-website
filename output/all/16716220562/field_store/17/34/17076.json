I expected to go flying off like a kangaroo. Is it artificial?\"  \"No. There's a dense core of some kind to the asteroid, some kind of metallic deposit. That's why we picked this asteroid out of all the others. It made the construction problem much simpler, and it also explains why the asteroid has natural air and water. Did you see the hills?\"  \"The hills?\"  \"When we get up higher in the tower we'll be able to see over the buildings. There's quite a natural park here, a regular little forest, complete with everything you'd want. Come in here, Harris. This is my office.\" The old man strode at quite a clip, around the corner and into a large, well-furnished apartment. \"Isn't this pleasant? I intend to make my last year here as amiable as possible.\" He frowned. \"Of course, with Deutsch gone, I may be here forever. Oh, well.\" He shrugged. \"Sit down, Harris.\"  \"Thanks.\" Harris took a chair, stretching his legs out. He watched Watts as he closed the door to the hall. \"By the way, any more cases come up?\"  \"Two more today,\" Watts was grim. \"Makes almost thirty, in all. We have three hundred men in this station. At the rate it's going--\"  \"Chief, you spoke about a forest on the asteroid. Do you allow the crew to go into the forest at will? Or do you restrict them to the buildings and grounds?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Watts rubbed his jaw. \"Well, it's a difficult situation, Harris. I have to let the men leave the grounds sometimes. They can _see_ the forest from the buildings, and as long as you can see a nice place to stretch out and relax that does it. Once every ten days they have a full period of rest. Then they go out and fool around.\"  \"And then it happens?\"  \"Yes, I suppose so. But as long as they can see the forest they'll want to go. I can't help it.\"  \"I know. I'm not censuring you. Well, what's your theory? What happens to them out there? What do they do?\"  \"What happens? Once they get out there and take it easy for a while they don't want to come back and work. It's boondoggling. Playing hookey. They don't want to work, so off they go.\"  \"How about this business of their delusions?\"  Watts laughed good-naturedly. \"Listen, Harris. You know as well as I do that's a lot of poppycock. They're no more plants than you or I. They just don't want to work, that's all. When I was a cadet we had a few ways to make people work. I wish we could lay a few on their backs, like we used to.\"  \"You think this is simple goldbricking, then?\"  \"Don't you think it is?\"  \"No,\" Harris said. \"They really believe they're plants. I put them through the high-frequency shock treatment, the shock box. The whole nervous system is paralyzed, all inhibitions stopped cold. They tell the truth, then. And they said the same thing--and more.\"  Watts paced back and forth, his hands clasped behind his back. \"Harris, you're a doctor, and I suppose you know what you're talking about. But look at the situation here. We have a garrison, a good modern garrison. We're probably the most modern outfit in the system. Every new device and gadget is here that science can produce. Harris, this garrison is one vast machine. The men are parts, and each has his job, the Maintenance Crew, the Biologists, the Office Crew, the Managerial Staff.  \"Look what happens when one person steps away from his job. Everything else begins to creak. We can't service the bugs if no one services the machines. We can't order food to feed the crews if no one makes out reports, takes inventories. We can't direct any kind of activity if the Second in Command decides to go out and sit in the sun all day.  \"Thirty people, one tenth of the Garrison. But we can't run without them. The Garrison is built that way. If you take the supports out the whole building falls. No one can leave. We're all tied here, and these people know it. They know they have no right to do that, run off on their own. No one has that right anymore. We're all too tightly interwoven to suddenly start doing what we want. It's unfair to the rest, the majority.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Harris nodded. \"Chief, can I ask you something?\"  \"What is it?\"  \"Are there any inhabitants on the asteroid? Any natives?\"  \"Natives?\" Watts considered. \"Yes, there's some kind of aborigines living out there.\" He waved vaguely toward the window.  \"What are they like? Have you seen them?\"  \"Yes, I've seen them. At least, I saw them when we first came here. They hung around for a while, watching us, then after a time they disappeared.\"  \"Did they die off? Diseases of some kind?\"  \"No. They just--just disappeared. Into their forest. They're still there, someplace.\"  \"What kind of people are they?\"  \"Well, the story is that they're originally from Mars. They don't look much like Martians, though. They're dark, a kind of coppery color. Thin. Very agile, in their own way. They hunt and fish. No written language. We don't pay much attention to them.\"  \"I see.\" Harris paused. \"Chief, have you ever heard of anything called--The Pipers?\"  \"The Pipers?\" Watts frowned. \"No. Why?\"  \"The patients mentioned something called The Pipers. According to Bradshaw, the Pipers taught him to become a plant. He learned it from them, a kind of teaching.\"  \"The Pipers. What are they?\"  \"I don't know,\" Harris admitted. \"I thought maybe you might know. My first assumption, of course, was that they're the natives. But now I'm not so sure, not after hearing your description of them.\"  \"The natives are primitive savages. They don't have anything to teach anybody, especially a top-flight biologist.\"  Harris hesitated. \"Chief, I'd like to go into the woods and look around. Is that possible?\"  \"Certainly. I can arrange it for you. I'll give you one of the men to show you around.\"  \"I'd rather go alone. Is there any danger?\"  \"No, none that I know of. Except--\"  \"Except the Pipers,\" Harris finished. \"I know. Well, there's only one way to find them, and that's it. I'll have to take my chances.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"If you walk in a straight line,\" Chief Watts said, \"you'll find yourself back at the Garrison in about six hours. It's a damn small asteroid. There's a couple of streams and lakes, so don't fall in.\"  \"How about snakes or poisonous insects?\"  \"Nothing like that reported. We did a lot of tramping around at first, but it's grown back now, the way it was. We never encountered anything dangerous.\"  \"Thanks, Chief,\" Harris said. They shook hands. \"I'll see you before nightfall.\"  \"Good luck.\" The Chief and his two armed escorts turned and went back across the rise, down the other side toward the Garrison. Harris watched them go until they disappeared inside the building. Then he turned and started into the grove of trees.  The woods were very silent around him as he walked. Trees towered up on all sides of him, huge dark-green trees like eucalyptus. The ground underfoot was soft with endless leaves that had fallen and rotted into soil. After a while the grove of high trees fell behind and he found himself crossing a dry meadow, the grass and weeds burned brown in the sun. Insects buzzed around him, rising up from the dry weed-stalks. Something scuttled ahead, hurrying through the undergrowth. He caught sight of a grey ball with many legs, scampering furiously, its antennae weaving.  The meadow ended at the bottom of a hill. He was going up, now, going higher and higher. Ahead of him an endless expanse of green rose, acres of wild growth. He scrambled to the top finally, blowing and panting, catching his breath.  He went on. Now he was going down again, plunging into a deep gully. Tall ferns grew, as large as trees. He was entering a living Jurassic forest, ferns that stretched out endlessly ahead of him. Down he went, walking carefully. The air began to turn cold around him. The floor of the gully was damp and silent; underfoot the ground was almost wet.  He came out on a level table. It was dark, with the ferns growing up on all sides, dense growths of ferns, silent and unmoving. He came upon a natural path, an old stream bed, rough and rocky, but easy to follow. The air was thick and oppressive. Beyond the ferns he could see the side of the next hill, a green field rising up.  Something grey was ahead. Rocks, piled-up boulders, scattered and stacked here and there. The stream bed led directly to them. Apparently this had been a pool of some kind, a stream emptying from it. He climbed the first of the boulders awkwardly, feeling his way up. At the top he paused, resting again.  As yet he had had no luck. So far he had not met any of the natives. It would be through them that he would find the mysterious Pipers that were stealing the men away, if such really existed. If he could find the natives, talk to them, perhaps he could find out something. But as yet he had been unsuccessful. He looked around. The woods were very silent. A slight breeze moved through the ferns, rustling them, but that was all. Where were the natives? Probably they had a settlement of some sort, huts, a clearing. The asteroid was small; he should be able to find them by nightfall.         *       *       *       *       *  He started down the rocks. More rocks rose up ahead and he climbed them. Suddenly he stopped, listening. Far off, he could hear a sound, the sound of water. Was he approaching a pool of some kind? He went on again, trying to locate the sound. He scrambled down rocks and up rocks, and all around him there was silence, except for the splashing of distant water. Maybe a waterfall, water in motion. A stream. If he found the stream he might find the natives.  The rocks ended and the stream bed began again, but this time it was wet, the bottom muddy and overgrown with moss. He was on the right track; not too long ago this stream had flowed, probably during the rainy season. He went up on the side of the stream, pushing through the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32832"],["title","Piper in the Woods (#3)"],["body"," and vines. A golden snake slid expertly out of his path. Something glinted ahead, something sparkling through the ferns. Water. A pool. He hurried, pushing the vines aside and stepping out, leaving them behind.  He was standing on the edge of a pool, a deep pool sunk in a hollow of grey rocks, surrounded by ferns and vines. The water was clear and bright, and in motion, flowing in a waterfall at the far end. It was beautiful, and he stood watching, marveling at it, the undisturbed quality of it. Untouched, it was. Just as it had always been, probably. As long as the asteroid existed. Was he the first to see it? Perhaps. It was so hidden, so concealed by the ferns. It gave him a strange feeling, a feeling almost of ownership. He stepped down a little toward the water.  And it was then he noticed her.  The girl was sitting on the far edge of the pool, staring down into the water, resting her head on one drawn-up knee. She had been bathing; he could see that at once. Her coppery body was still wet and glistening with moisture, sparkling in the sun. She had not seen him. He stopped, holding his breath, watching her.  She was lovely, very lovely, with long dark hair that wound around her shoulders and arms. Her body was slim, very slender, with a supple grace to it that made him stare, accustomed as he was to various forms of anatomy. How silent she was! Silent and unmoving, staring down at the water. Time passed, strange, unchanging time, as he watched the girl. Time might even have ceased, with the girl sitting on the rock staring into the water, and the rows of great ferns behind her, as rigid as if they had been painted there.  All at once the girl looked up. Harris shifted, suddenly conscious of himself as an intruder. He stepped back. \"I'm sorry,\" he murmured. \"I'm from the Garrison. I didn't mean to come poking around.\"  She nodded without speaking.  \"You don't mind?\" Harris asked presently.  \"No.\"  So she spoke Terran! He moved a little toward her, around the side of the pool. \"I hope you don't mind my bothering you. I won't be on the asteroid very long. This is my first day here. I just arrived from Terra.\"  She smiled faintly.  \"I'm a doctor. Henry Harris.\" He looked down at her, at the slim coppery body, gleaming in the sunlight, a faint sheen of moisture on her arms and thighs. \"You might be interested in why I'm here.\" He paused. \"Maybe you can even help me.\"  She looked up a little. \"Oh?\"  \"Would you like to help me?\"  She smiled. \"Yes. Of course.\"  \"That's good. Mind if I sit down?\" He looked around and found himself a flat rock. He sat down slowly, facing her. \"Cigarette?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, I'll have one.\" He lit up, taking a deep breath. \"You see, we have a problem at the Garrison. Something has been happening to some of the men, and it seems to be spreading. We have to find out what causes it or we won't be able to run the Garrison.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He waited for a moment. She nodded slightly. How silent she was! Silent and unmoving. Like the ferns.  \"Well, I've been able to find out a few things from them, and one very interesting fact stands out. They keep saying that something called--called The Pipers are responsible for their condition. They say the Pipers taught them--\" He stopped. A strange look had flitted across her dark, small face. \"Do you know the Pipers?\"  She nodded.  Acute satisfaction flooded over Harris. \"You do? I was sure the natives would know.\" He stood up again. \"I was sure they would, if the Pipers really existed. Then they do exist, do they?\"  \"They exist.\"  Harris frowned. \"And they're here, in the woods?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I see.\" He ground his cigarette out impatiently. \"You don't suppose there's any chance you could take me to them, do you?\"  \"Take you?\"  \"Yes. I have this problem and I have to solve it. You see, the Base Commander on Terra has assigned this to me, this business about the Pipers. It has to be solved. And I'm the one assigned to the job. So it's important to me to find them. Do you see? Do you understand?\"  She nodded.  \"Well, will you take me to them?\"  The girl was silent. For a long time she sat, staring down into the water, resting her head against her knee. Harris began to become impatient. He fidgeted back and forth, resting first on one leg and then on the other.  \"Well, will you?\" he said again. \"It's important to the whole Garrison. What do you say?\" He felt around in his pockets. \"Maybe I could give you something. What do I have....\" He brought out his lighter. \"I could give you my lighter.\"  The girl stood up, rising slowly, gracefully, without motion or effort. Harris' mouth fell open. How supple she was, gliding to her feet in a single motion! He blinked. Without effort she had stood, seemingly without _change_. All at once she was standing instead of sitting, standing and looking calmly at him, her small face expressionless.  \"Will you?\" he said.  \"Yes. Come along.\" She turned away, moving toward the row of ferns.  Harris followed quickly, stumbling across the rocks. \"Fine,\" he said. \"Thanks a lot. I'm very interested to meet these Pipers. Where are you taking me, to your village? How much time do we have before nightfall?\"  The girl did not answer. She had entered the ferns already, and Harris quickened his pace to keep from losing her. How silently she glided!  \"Wait,\" he called. \"Wait for me.\"  The girl paused, waiting for him, slim and lovely, looking silently back.  He entered the ferns, hurrying after her.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, I'll be damned!\" Commander Cox said. \"It sure didn't take you long.\" He leaped down the steps two at a time. \"Let me give you a hand.\"  Harris grinned, lugging his heavy suitcases. He set them down and breathed a sigh of relief. \"It isn't worth it,\" he said. \"I'm going to give up taking so much.\"  \"Come on inside. Soldier, give him a hand.\" A Patrolman hurried over and took one of the suitcases. The three men went inside and down the corridor to Harris' quarters. Harris unlocked the door and the Patrolman deposited his suitcase inside.  \"Thanks,\" Harris said. He set the other down beside it. \"It's good to be back, even for a little while.\"  \"A little while?\"  \"I just came back to settle my affairs. I have to return to Y-3 tomorrow morning.\"  \"Then you didn't solve the problem?\"  \"I solved it, but I haven't _cured_ it. I'm going back and get to work right away. There's a lot to be done.\"  \"But you found out what it is?\"  \"Yes. It was just what the men said. The Pipers.\"  \"The Pipers do exist?\"  \"Yes.\" Harris nodded. \"They do exist.\" He removed his coat and put it over the back of the chair. Then he went to the window and let it down. Warm spring air rushed into the room. He settled himself on the bed, leaning back.  \"The Pipers exist, all right--in the minds of the Garrison crew! To the crew, the Pipers are real. The crew created them. It's a mass hypnosis, a group projection, and all the men there have it, to some degree.\"  \"How did it start?\"  \"Those men on Y-3 were sent there because they were skilled, highly-trained men with exceptional ability. All their lives they've been schooled by complex modern society, fast tempo and high integration between people. Constant pressure toward some goal, some job to be done.  \"Those men are put down suddenly on an asteroid where there are natives living the most primitive of existence, completely vegetable lives. No concept of goal, no concept of purpose, and hence no ability to plan. The natives live the way the animals live, from day to day, sleeping, picking food from the trees. A kind of Garden-of-Eden existence, without struggle or conflict.\"  \"So? But--\"  \"Each of the Garrison crew sees the natives and _unconsciously_ thinks of his own early life, when he was a child, when _he_ had no worries, no responsibilities, before he joined modern society. A baby lying in the sun.  \"But he can't admit this to himself! He can't admit that he might _want_ to live like the natives, to lie and sleep all day. So he invents The Pipers, the idea of a mysterious group living in the woods who trap him, lead him into their kind of life. Then he can blame _them_, not himself. They 'teach' him to become a part of the woods.\"  \"What are you going to do? Have the woods burned?\"  \"No.\" Harris shook his head. \"That's not the answer; the woods are harmless. The answer is psychotherapy for the men. That's why I'm going right back, so I can begin work. They've got to be made to see that the Pipers are inside them, their own unconscious voices calling to them to give up their responsibilities. They've got to be made to realize that there are no Pipers, at least, not outside themselves. The woods are harmless and the natives have nothing to teach anyone. They're primitive savages, without even a written language. We're seeing a psychological projection by a whole Garrison of men who want to lay down their work and take it easy for a while.\"  The room was silent.  \"I see,\" Cox said presently. \"Well, it makes sense.\" He got to his feet. \"I hope you can do something with the men when you get back.\"  \"I hope so, too,\" Harris agreed. \"And I think I can. After all, it's just a question of increasing their self-awareness. When they have that the Pipers will vanish.\"  Cox nodded. \"Well, you go ahead with your unpacking, Doc. I'll see you at dinner. And maybe before you leave, tomorrow.\"  \"Fine.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Harris opened the door and the Commander went out into the hall. Harris closed the door after him and then went back across the room. He looked out the window for a moment, his hands in his pockets.  It was becoming evening, the air was turning cool. The sun was just setting as he watched, disappearing behind the buildings of the city surrounding the hospital. He watched it go down.  Then he went over to his two suitcases. He was tired, very tired from his trip. A great weariness was beginning to descend over him. There"]]]
