He walked right into the closed door, which failed to open before him, though it had operated smoothly a moment ago.  \"Robots not admitted after dark,\" a mechanical voice informed him. \"Return to your stall in the shed.\"  \"Whom do you think you're talking to?\" demanded Robert. \"I'm not one of your robots!\"  There was a pause.  \"Is it Marcia-Joan?\" asked the voice-box, after considerable buzzing and whirring.  \"No, I'm Robert.\"  There was another pause while the mechanism laboriously shifted back to its other speech tape. Then: \"Robots not admitted after dark. Return to your stall in the shed.\"  Robert slowly raised both hands to his temples. Lingeringly, he dragged them down over his cheeks and under his chin until at last the fingers interlaced over his tight lips. After a moment, he let out his breath between his fingers and dropped his hands to his sides.  He raised one foot to kick, but decided that the door looked too hard.  He walked away between the beds of flowers, grumbling.         *       *       *       *       *  Reaching the vicinity of the cottage, he parted the tall shrubs bordering its grounds and looked through carefully before proceeding. Pleased at the gleam of water, he called Blue Two.  \"Good enough! Put the other robots away for the night. They can trim the edges tomorrow.\"  He started into the cottage, but his major-domo warned, \"Someone comes.\"  Robert looked around. Through thin portions of the shrubbery, he caught a glimpse of Marcia-Joan's crimson robe, nearly black in the diffused glow of the lights illuminating the grounds.  \"Robert!\" called the girl angrily. \"What are your robots doing? I saw them from my upstairs window--\"  \"Wait there!\" exclaimed Robert as she reached the shrubs.  \"What? Are you trying to tell me where I can go or not go? I--YI!\"  The shriek was followed by a tremendous splash. Robert stepped forward in time to be spattered by part of the flying spray. It was cold.  _Naturally, being drawn from the brook_, he reflected. _Oh, well, the sun will warm it tomorrow._  There was a frenzy of thrashing and splashing in the dimly lighted water at his feet, accompanied by coughs and spluttering demands that he \"do something!\"  [Illustration]  Robert reached down with one hand, caught his hostess by the wrist, and heaved her up to solid ground.  \"My robots are digging you a little swimming hole,\" he told her. \"They brought the water from the brook by a trench. You can finish it with concrete or plastics later; it's only fifteen by thirty feet.\"  He expected some sort of acknowledgment of his efforts, and peered at her through the gloom when none was forthcoming. He thus caught a glimpse of the full-swinging slap aimed at his face. He tried to duck.  There was another splash, followed by more floundering about.  \"Reach up,\" said Robert patiently, \"and I'll pull you out again. I didn't expect you to like it this much.\"  Marcia-Joan scrambled up the bank, tugged viciously at her sodden robe, and headed for the nearest pathway without replying. Robert followed along.  As they passed under one of the lights, he noticed that the red reflections of the wet material, where it clung snugly to the girl's body, were almost the color of some of his robots.  _The tennis robot_, he thought, _and the moving targets for archery--in fact, all the sporting equipment._  \"You talk about food for the figure,\" he remarked lightly. \"You should see yourself now! It's really funny, the way--\"  He stopped. Some strange emotion stifled his impulse to laugh at the way the robe clung.  Instead, he lengthened his stride, but he was still a few feet behind when she charged through the front entrance of the house. The door, having opened automatically for her, started to swing closed. Robert sprang forward to catch it.  \"Wait a minute!\" he cried.  Marcia-Joan snapped something that sounded like \"Get out!\" over her shoulder, and squished off toward the stairs. As Robert started through the door to follow, the striped robot hastened toward him from its post in the hall.  \"Do not use the front door!\" it warned him.  \"Out of my way!\" growled Robert.  The robot reached out to enforce the command. Robert seized it by the forearm and put all his weight into a sudden tug. The machine tottered off balance. Releasing his grip, he sent it staggering out the door with a quick shove.         *       *       *       *       *  A hasty glance showed Marcia-Joan flapping wetly up the last steps. Robert turned to face the robot.  \"Do not use that door!\" he quoted vindictively, and the robot halted its rush indecisively. \"Only Marcia-Joan uses it.\"  The major-domo hesitated. After a moment, it strode off around the corner of the house. First darting one more look at the stairs, Robert thrust his head outside and shouted: \"Blue Two!\"  He held the door open while he waited. There was an answer from the shrubbery. Presently, his own supervisor hurried up.  \"Fetch the emergency toolbox!\" Robert ordered. \"And bring a couple of others with you.\"  \"Naturally, Robert. I would not carry it myself.\"  A moment after the robot had departed on the errand, heavy steps sounded at the rear of the hall. Marcia-Joan's robot had dealt with the mechanism of the back door.  Robert eyed the metal mask as the robot walked up to him. He found the color contrast less pleasant than ever.  \"I am not using the door,\" he said hastily. \"I am merely holding it open.\"  \"Do you intend to use it?\"  \"I haven't decided.\"  \"I shall carry you out back,\" the robot decided for him.  \"No, you don't!\" exclaimed Robert, leaping backward.  The door immediately began to swing shut as he passed through.  Cursing, he lunged forward. The robot reached for him.  This time, Robert missed his grip. Before he could duck away, his wrist was trapped in a metal grasp.  _The door will close_, he despaired. _They'll be too late._  Then, suddenly, he felt the portal drawn back and heard Blue Two speak.  \"What does Robert wish?\"  \"Throw this heap out the door!\" gasped Robert.  Amid a trampling of many feet, the major-domo was raised bodily by Blue Two and another pair of Robert's machines and hustled outside. Since the grip on Robert's wrist was not relaxed, he involuntarily accompanied the rush of metal bodies.  \"Catch the door!\" he called to Blue Two.  When the latter sprang to obey, the other two took the action as a signal to drop their burden. The pink-and-blue robot landed full length with a jingling crash. Robert was free.  With the robots, he made for the entrance. Hearing footsteps behind him as the major-domo regained its feet, he slipped hastily inside.  \"Pick up that toolbox!\" he snapped. \"When that robot stops in the doorway, knock its head off!\"  Turning, he held up a finger.  [Illustration]  \"Do not use the front door!\"  The major-domo hesitated.  The heavy toolbox in the grip of Blue Two descended with a thud. The pink-and-blue robot landed on the ground a yard or two outside the door as if dropped from the second floor. It bounced once, emitted a few sparks and pungent wisps of smoke, lay still.  \"Never mind, that's good enough,\" said Robert as Blue Two stepped forward. \"One of the others can drag it off to the repair shop. Have the toolbox brought with us.\"  \"What does Robert wish now?\" inquired Blue Two, trailing the man toward the stairway.  \"I'm going upstairs,\" said Robert. \"And I intend to be prepared if any more doors are closed against me!\"  He started up, the measured treads of his own robots sounding reassuringly behind him....         *       *       *       *       *  It was about a week later that Robert sat relaxed in the armchair before his own telescreen, facing Henry's wizened visage.  The elder man clucked sympathetically as he re-examined the scratches on Robert's face and the bruise under his right eye.  \"And so you left there in the morning?\"  \"I certainly did!\" declared Robert. \"We registered a marriage record at the city library by television, of course, but I don't care if I never see her again. She needn't even tell me about the child, if any. I simply can't stand that girl!\"  \"Now, now,\" Henry said.  \"I mean it! Absolutely no consideration for my wishes. Everything in the house was run to suit her convenience.\"  \"After all,\" Henry pointed out, \"it _is_ her house.\"  Robert glared. \"What has that to do with it? I don't think I was as unreasonable as she said in smashing that robot. The thing just wouldn't let me alone!\"  \"I guess,\" Henry suggested, \"it was conditioned to obey Marcia-Joan, not you.\"  \"Well, that shows you! Whose orders are to count, anyway? When I tell a robot to do something, I expect it done. How would you like to find robots trying to boss you around?\"  \"Are you talking about robots,\" asked Henry, \"or the girl?\"  \"Same thing, isn't it? Or it would be if I'd decided to bring her home with me.\"  \"Conflict of desires,\" murmured Henry.  \"Exactly! It's maddening to have a perfectly logical action interfered with because there's another person present to insist--_insist_, mind you--on having her way.\"  \"And for twenty-odd years, you've had your own way in every tiny thing.\"  Somewhere in the back of Robert's lurked a feeling that Henry sounded slightly sarcastic.  \"Well, why shouldn't I?\" he demanded. \"I noticed that in every disagreement, my view was the right one.\"  \"It was?\"  \"Of course it was! What did you mean by that tone?\"  \"Nothing....\" Henry seemed lost in thought. \"I was just wondering how many 'right' views are left on this planet. There must be quite a few, all different, even if we have picked up only a few by television. An interesting facet of our peculiar culture--every individual omnipotent and omniscient, _within his own sphere_.\"  Robert regarded him with indignant incredulity.  \"You don't seem to understand my point,\" he began again. \"I told her we ought to come to my house,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32764"],["title","Manners of the Age (#3)"],["body"," where things are better arranged, and she simply refused. Contradicted me! It was most--\"  He broke off.  \"The _impudence_ of him!\" he exclaimed. \"Signing off when _I_ wanted to talk!\"                                                             --H. B.
