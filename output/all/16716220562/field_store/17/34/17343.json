MAYER  VERSES BY ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE  [Illustration]  NEW YORK R. H. RUSSELL  MDCCCXCVII     Copyright 1897   BY   ROBERT HOWARD RUSSELL     [Illustration]  PART FIRST.  THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST.       Where the light laughs in through the tree-tops       And sports with the tangled glade,     In the depths of an Afric forest       My earliest scenes were laid.  [Illustration]      In a bower that was merry with smilax       From the grimace of no-where, I woke     I was born on the first day of April       And they called me a jungle joke.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      And the voices of birds were about me--       And the beat and the flutter of wing;     While morning returned at the trumpet       Of Tusky, our elephant king.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      My nurse was a crooning old beldame       Who gazed in the palms of my hands     And vowed I was destined to travel       In many and marvellous lands.  [Illustration]      But little I heeded her croaking,       For I gamboled the whole day long,     And swung by my tail from the tree-top,       Or joined in the jungle song.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  THE SONG OF THE JUNGLE.       _The Elephant:_          Oh, I am the lord of the forest and plain!      _The Lion, Tigers, etc.:_          And we are the beasts that acknowledge your reign!      _The Birds:_          And we are the minstrels that come at your call!      _The Monkeys:_          And we are the jesters that laugh at you all!  [Illustration]      _Chorus, All--_      _Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!_       _The tribes of the jungle are we--_     _Our home is the darksome wilderness_       _That never a man shall see._      _The Elephant:_          Oh, the jungle was meant and was made for my will!      _The Lions, Tigers, etc.:_          For the sport of the chase and the zest of the kill!      _The Birds:_          For the beating of wings and the echo of song!      _The Monkeys:_          For gambol and grimace the whole season long!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      _Chorus, All:_      _Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Oh, yes!_       _For all of the tribes that be_     _With homes in the tangled wilderness_       _That never a man shall see._  [Illustration]      But, alas, for the boasts of the jungle!       The men came among us one day,     And one with a box that made music       Enticed foolish monkeys away.      The birds and the beasts of the forest       Were mute at the marvellous song,     But the monkeys crept out of the tree-tops--       An eager and wondering throng.  [Illustration]      The birds and the beasts of the forest       Kept hidden and silent that day,     But the monkey-folk formed a procession       And followed the minstrel away.      And thus did we give up the forest       To dwell with our brothers, the men--     Farewell to the beautiful jungle!       'Twas long ere I saw it again!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  PART SECOND.  THE WAYS OF MEN.       Then away to a far distant country       On a drift that they said was a ship,     And I studied the ways of my master       And profited much by the trip.      And we sailed to his home in fair Naples,       Where I studied the language of men,     And I sat on a bench with his children,       But soon we went sailing again.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      And I made some nice friends on the voyage,       And engaged in a pretty romance.     I charmed all the ladies by climbing,       And one of them taught me to dance.  [Illustration]      Yet often I longed for the jungle--       Its song and the rustle of wing--     And sometimes at night in my slumber       I talked with our elephant king.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      One morning my master awoke me,       And, dressed in a gaudy new suit,     I beheld the New World in the sunlight,       And lifted my hat in salute.      And then began troubles and trials--       Through the streets by a string I was led;     Toiling hard all the day for my master,       Yet oft going hungry to bed.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      But he sold me at last to a circus       And my lot became easier then,     So I gave many moments of leisure       To acquiring the habits of men.      I copied their manners and customs       I made of each fashion a note;     And the children admired my performance       And the ladies the cut of my coat.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      By and by I was sold to a banker       Who was charmed with my ball-rolling feat,     And arrayed in a Fauntleroy costume       I passed all my time on the street.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      But alas for my plans of the future!       He died without leaving a cent,     And I had to go out to hard labor       To pay for my victuals and rent;      Till I met with a gentleman's valet       Who was like me in manner and face,     And I told him some stories that pleased him       And bribed him to give me his place.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      Then I started to serve my new master--       A bachelor cynic was he,     Who quickly saw through the deception       And made a proposal to me.      Said he: \"You're a monkey, you rascal,       And an excellent type of the brood;     Let's play a good joke on society       By passing you off as a dude.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      So he took me at first to his barber,       Who shaved me and shortened my hair,     And the last tangled trace of the jungle       Was gone when I rose from his chair.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      And then to his tailor and hatter--       His hosier and all of the rest,     Till at night I was changed from a monkey       To a chappie most stylishly dressed.      And standing alone and reflecting       I thought of the why and the how,     And I wondered what Tusky was doing       And what would the jungle say, now.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  PART THIRD.  THE BUTTERFLY WHIRL.      It was then for the triumphs of conquest!       Oh, then for the life of the swell!     I dwelt like a lord with my patron       In a suite of a gilded hotel.      And we went out to plays and to dinners--       On the ladies he took me to call--     And once we received invitations       To a beautiful fancy-dress ball.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      'Twas a famous affair and it won me,       With its titter and tinsel and tune,     For it carried me back to the jungle       And the monkey-dance under the moon.      Then I mingled with other diversions.       I learned how to paint and to ride;     I cut a great figure at polo--       The science of golfing I tried.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      As a wheelman I soon became famous       And made a great score on the track--     I was known as the king of the scorchers,       With the typical bicycle back.      Then a girl who was youthful and silly       Made love to me just for a lark,     And came with an elegant turnout       And took me to drive in the park.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      And I took her out boating next morning,       For the face of my charmer was fair;     It carried me back to the jungle--       To the flow'rs that were blossoming there.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      But soon, in the midst of my pleasure,       In the glow of a roseate dream,     The boat struck a rock and tipped over       And tumbled us both in the stream.      Then, ho, for the skill of the jungle!       The deftness of foot and of hand!     For I hung from a limb and I saved her       And drew her at last to the strand.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      And then to her home I went proudly       To claim the fair maid for my own,     But her father demanded a title,       And hardened his heart like a stone.      And now came the death of my patron,       That left me alone in the strife,     And yearning once more for the jungle,       I turned to political life.  [Illustration]     PART FOURTH.  THE RETURN PATH.       Then I studied a week to gain knowledge,       And waded through volumes of stuff,     And I found that the only requirements       Were cunning and blarney and bluff.      And these I had brought from the jungle--       Inherited straight from my race--     With a gift for political music       And a truly political face.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      Thus feeling at home in my labors,       My plan was successful, of course,     And when they came round with appointments       They gave me a job on \"the force.\"      And such was my skill as a roundsman,       And talent in keeping the peace,     That I rose in a year to be Captain,       And then to be Chief of Police!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      And then, as my years were advancing,       So great was their honor and trust,     That they twined me a chaplet of laurel       And sculptured in marble my bust.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      Yet often I dreamed of the jungle--       Its song and the rustle of wing--     And sometimes still talked in my slumber       With Tusky, our elephant king.      When, lo, my political party,       That now was in power and supreme,     Conferred a most noble appointment       That realized all of my dream.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      For they made me their African envoy,       And soon I went sailing again,     To meet my old playmates and tell them       The ways and the customs of men.      To calm the dusk native, and gather       My people in sun-haunted nooks     To tell them my story, and teach them       The wisdom that cometh of books;  [Illustration]  [Illustration]      The words and the ways of _their fathers_,       And deliver my race from its ban,     For man did not spring from the monkey,       But monkey"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33629"],["title","The Autobiography of a Monkey (#1)"],["body","from man!_  [Illustration]  [Illustration]"]]]
