I remember that      I ate a whole can of roast chicken and many sweet      biscuits, and washed the whole down with some sherry wine      drank from the bottle--my first experience in wine      drinking.       Much refreshed, I took up my musket and started for      Washington with an oddly mixed crowd of gay militia      uniforms representing parts of many regiments. Yet there      were still behind us good, orderly, full regiments, that      stayed in Centreville till after midnight and came into      Washington late the next day in fine marching order.      _They_ did not run, and my brother's regiment was one of      them. It was 10 P. M. when I reached Fairfax Court House.      There I rested, sitting on a rail fence, as a motley      crowd poured by, each squad saying that the Black Horse      Cavalry was coming. So I clung to my musket, though my      shoulders began to get a little sore. It was after      midnight when I started again. The night was very dark,      for heavy clouds obscured the moon. The road, very rough      in itself, was now full of materials thrown out of      wagons. There were shovels, pickaxes, boxes, barrels,      iron mess-kettles, muskets, knapsacks, and all sorts of      litter that soldiers could throw away, and over these and      the loose stones of the rough road we stumbled in the      dark, amid choking dust, and up and down the long rolling      hills that the army marched over so often afterwards      during that terrible war. Still, I well remember that it      seemed to me a sort of wild picnic; and I would clutch my      gun and feel of my cartridges in a very determined mood      to defend Washington to the death.       Wearily the night wore on; and steadily I tramped,      talking in the dark, from time to time, with      strangers--men from all parts of the Union whom I didn't      see then and probably never saw afterwards. Bad as it was      to march in the dust, it was still worse when it began to      rain just before daybreak. Gently it came at first; and      slowly the dust became a thick paste of slippery mud.      Steadily the storm increased till it became a downpour. I      had on a thin black summer suit, a straw hat, and a pair      of low-cut thin shoes and white stockings. When day broke      we were a bedraggled, thoroughly soaked, mud-stained      party. Of all that vast crowd probably I presented the      worst appearance, for I was the only citizen in that      section of the crowd. I bantered jokes with such as were      in joking mood, but most of the crowd were now silent and      weary. All along the road lay men asleep in the pouring      rain. There were blood blisters on my feet, but never      once did I stop except to get a drink of water at a brook      just after daylight. The rain now fell in torrents; we      were literally wading in mud and water.       The thirty miles from Centreville to Washington seemed      three times that distance. My gun grew more and more      heavy, and I shifted it constantly. It was about ten      o'clock Monday forenoon when I reached the Virginia end      of Long Bridge. A strong guard was posted there to stop      the troops; for Washington was already full of fugitive      soldiers. Forcing my way through a vast mob of shouting,      cursing soldiers, I reached the officer in charge, and      got a rough reception. First he doubted my pass; next he      wanted to take away my musket, but I protested that I had      saved it from the enemy; and at length he allowed me to      pass carrying the gun I had so honestly won. I went down      Pennsylvania Avenue much stared at as I limped along.      Reaching my hotel, I took a bath and turned into a good      bed, thinking of my brother and the thousands of other      soldiers who were out in the rain and many of whom would      perhaps have no bed to turn into for three years; for      there were a few three years regiments even then.       The next day, to my great joy, my brother's regiment      marched in and over to Georgetown heights; and, after      visiting them there, I sent my gun home by Adams Ex. and      took the train for Boston. Said my father, when I got      home, \"Well, I think you have got enough of war now.\"      \"No, sir,\" I said, and in less than thirty days I had      enlisted; and three years from the date of the first      battle of Bull Run I was skirmishing about six miles from      Richmond--three years--and yet I hadn't quite got to      Richmond.       That Bull-Run musket is the only war weapon left in the      family, and I hope you will keep it in memory of the good      work I was willing to do with it, even before I was a      soldier.   Dr. SAMUEL A. GREEN then said:  I have listened with intense interest to Mr. Clement's paper, as I was not only present at the skirmish therein described, but as Assistant Surgeon of the First Massachusetts Volunteers it was my professional duty to look after the wounded on that occasion. I remember vividly the events of that day, July 18, 1861, not only because it was the first time that I ever was under fire, but because it was the greatest fight that up to that time the Union army had fought. I remember, too, the proud record made by the First Massachusetts in that preliminary skirmish. In each of two companies,--G and H,--the regiment lost six men; and Company H--to which Mr. Clement's paper relates--had more men wounded than killed. Nor were these the only losses met by the Old First in that memorable action. The wounded men came under my professional charge, and they received such care as could be given them on the field of battle, scanty though it was. The men who fell in that skirmish--some of them my friends and all my acquaintances--left impressions on my mind so deep that I have since accepted without hesitation the fact that \"war is hell.\" This action of July 18 was only a skirmish that preceded the first battle of Bull Run, which was fought three days later on July 21. The armies contending on that day were commanded, respectively, by General McDowell and General Beauregard; and the result is now a matter of history.  As an instance of the changes which the whirligig of time brings round, I will relate a fact which is purely personal. In December, 1878, I was appointed a member of the Commission authorized by Congress to investigate the Yellow Fever Epidemic of that year, and sessions were held in several southern cities, including New Orleans. While the Commission was in session in that city, General Beauregard was a regular attendant at the meetings, and for some days I was thrown much with him, and we talked over together the campaign of 1861. In answer to one of my questions, why the southern army did not follow up their victory and capture the city of Washington, he replied that President Davis was strongly of the opinion that such an event would produce a revulsion of feeling on the part of northern sympathizers with the south and thus would defeat their own purpose.  A few years later, in the summer of 1883, I was a member of the Board of Visitors appointed by the President to make the annual examination at Annapolis, Maryland, where I was thrown into intimate relations with General McDowell. I slept under the same roof with him and ate at the same table, and often we discussed military matters. These two episodes in my life are now pleasant events to remember.  I was deeply impressed with General McDowell's strict abstinence from the use of champagne and other alcoholic liquors. Receiving his early education in France, one would suppose that, like the French boys who were his companions, he would drink Bordeaux wine as freely as milk; but he told me that never in Europe or here was he in the habit of taking anything stronger than water. In my intercourse with him for a week I saw nothing in his life to disprove this statement.  Mr. JAMES FORD RHODES said:  The reports in circulation after the Battle of Bull Run, regarding McDowell, are an instance of the hasty and uncharitable judgment of newspapers and their readers. It was at once said that the Union defeat was due to McDowell's intoxication. As a matter of fact McDowell never in his life drank a drop of beer, wine, or any alcoholic beverage, and curiously enough too did not use tobacco in any form. The proof of this is undoubted, but as part of it I may mention the positive assurances of Dr. William H. Russell, the American correspondent of the London Times, sometimes spoken of as \"Bull-Run Russell,\" who knew McDowell well and saw him on the day of the battle, and of Colonel Franklin Haven, who served on his staff during the war. Dr. Russell told me that on the morning of the battle McDowell ate watermelon for breakfast, and the free indulgence in this succulent fruit made him ill, which was the sole foundation for the cruel report.[5]  [5] Since my statement our associate Barrett Wendell has communicated to me this information: \"Edmund Clarence Stedman, who was present at Bull Run as a reporter, told me that on the night before the battle McDowell, hungry after his preparation, was served at his supper with canned fruit,--I think peaches,--and ate heartily of them. The fruit was probably tainted and brought on an attack of cholera morbus, from which Stedman saw him acutely suffering while the battle was in progress.\" I have no doubt that this is a more accurate version than Russell's.

Upon a certain night--the date of which must remain vague--there came a man who faced and was not turned back by a series of psychological barriers along this road which made it more impregnable than a steel wall. These barriers, which had kept out a hundred years of curiosity-seekers until that certain night, were forged by the scientific magic of a genius on a planet far beyond the sun....  The man who boldly followed his headlights up the road was of middle age with calm, honest eyes and a firm mouth indicating bargains made in his name would be kept. He pushed on, feeling the subtle force of the psychological powers against him but resisting because he vaguely understood them.  He left his car presently and raised his hand to touch the hard outline of a small book he carried in his breast pocket and with the gesture his determination hardened. He set his jaw firmly, snapped on the flashlight he had taken from the dash of his convertible and moved on up the road.  His firm, brisk steps soon brought him to its end, a great iron gate, its lock and hinges rusted tight under the patient hand of Time. It was high and spiked and too dangerous for climbing. But someone had smashed the lock with a heavy instrument and had applied force until the rusted hinges gave and the gate stood partially open. From the look of the metal, this could have been done recently--even in the past few minutes.         *       *       *       *       *  The man entered and found a flagstone pathway. He followed this for a time with the aid of his flashlight. Then he stopped and raised the beam.  It revealed the outline of a great stone mansion, its myriad windows like black, sightless eyes, its silent bulk telling of long solitude, its tongueless voice whispering: _Go away, stranger. Only peril and misfortune await you here._  But I am not exactly a stranger, the man told himself, approaching the door and half hoping to find the scowling panel locked.  But it was not locked. The ponderous knob turned under his hand. The panel moved back silently. The man gripped his flashlight and stepped inside.  The knowledge that he was no longer alone came as a shock. It was brought to him by the sound of labored breathing and he flashed the light about frantically trying to locate the source of the harsh sound. Then the bright circle picked out a huddled form on the floor nearby. The man moved forward instantly and went to his knees.  He was looking into an incredibly ancient face. The skin was so deeply lined as to hang in folds around the sunken eyes. The mouth was but a toothless maw and the body so shrunken as to seem incapable of clinging to life. The voice was a harsh whisper.  \"Thank God you have come. I am dying. The opening of the gate took all my remaining strength.\"  \"You have been waiting for me?\"  \"I have been waiting out the years--striving to keep life in my body until the moment of destiny. I wanted to see _him_. I wanted to be there when the door to his resting place opens and he comes forth to right the terrible wrongs that have been done our people.\"  The strength of the ancient one was ebbing fast. The words he spoke had been an effort. The kneeling man said, \"I don't understand all this.\"  \"That matters not. It is important only that you keep the bargain made long ago with your sire, and that you are here. Someone must be with _him_ at the awakening.\"  The newcomer again touched the book in his pocket. \"I came because our word had been given--\"  The dying man picked feebly at his sleeve. \"Please! You must go below! The great clock has measured the years. Soon it tolls the moment. Soon a thundering on the Plains of Ofrid will herald the new age--the Fighting Age--and a new day will dawn.\"  While the visitor held his frail shoulders, the dying man gasped and said, \"Hasten! Hurry to the vault below! Would that I could go with you, but that is not to be.\"  And then the visitor realized he was holding a corpse in his arms. He laid it gently down and did as he had been directed to do.     CHAPTER II  _The Great Clock of Tarth_   The Plains of Ofrid on the planet Tarth stretched flat and monotonous as far as the eye could reach, a gently waving ocean of soft, knee-high grass where herds of wild stads grazed and bright-hued birds vied in brilliance with the flaming sun.  From the dark Abarian Forests to the Ice Fields of Nadia, the plain stretched unbroken except for the tall, gray tower in its exact center and it was toward this tower that various groups of Tarthans were now moving.  Every nation on the planet was represented in greater or lesser number. The slim, erect Nadians in their flat-bottomed air cars that could hang motionless in space or skim the surface of the planet at a thousand jeks an hour. The grim-faced Abarians, tall and finely muscled on their powerful stads, their jeweled uniforms flashing back the glory of the heavens. The Utalians, those chameleon men of Tarth, their skins now the exact color of the grasses across which they rode, thus causing their stads to appear unmounted and unguided.  All the nations of Tarth were represented, drawn toward the tower by a century-old legend, a legend which Retoc the Abarian clarified as he rode at the head of his own proud group.  He waved a hand, indicating the vast plain and spoke to Hultax, his second in command, saying, \"Little would one think that this flat, empty land was once the site of a vast and powerful nation. One of the greatest upon all Tarth!\" A smile of cruelty and satisfaction played upon his handsome features as he surveyed the plain.  \"Aye,\" Hultax replied. \"The realm of the Ofridians. Truly they were a great nation.\"  \"But we Abarians were greater,\" Retoc snapped. \"We not only defeated them but we leveled their land until not one stone stood upon another.\"  \"All save the tower,\" Hultax said. \"No weapon known could so much as scratch its surface.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A new voice cut in. \"Quite true. Portox's scientific skill was too great for you.\" Both Abarians turned quickly to scowl at the newcomer, Bontarc of Nadia, who had swung close in his one-man car and was hovering by their side.  Retoc's hand moved toward the hilt of his long whip-like sword, driven there by the look of contempt in Bontarc's eyes. But Retoc hesitated. A formidable squadron of Bontarc's Nadian fighting men hovered nearby and the Abarian had no taste for a battle in which the odds were close to even.  \"We defeated the Ofridians fairly,\" he said.  \"And slaughtered them fairly? Cut down the men and women and children alike until the entire nation was obliterated?\"  The systematic annihilation had taken place a century before when Bontarc had been but a child and Retoc a young man. Karnod, Retoc's father, now dead, had planned the war that defeated the Ofridians, his winning card having been spies in the court of Evalla, Queen of Ofrid. Karnod had been fatally wounded during the last battle and had delegated to his son the task of annihilating the Ofridians and levelling their nation. This task, Retoc accepted with relish, reserving for himself the pleasure of slaying Queen Evalla. Details of the torture to which Retoc subjected the beautiful Evalla were whispered over the planet and it was said the sadistic Retoc had taken photographs of the Queen in her agony to enjoy in later years.  It had been the scientific ability of Portox of Ofrid that had engendered the Abarian hatred and jealousy in the first place. Portox used his science for the good of all on the planet Tarth, but when Karnod, Lord of Abaria, struck, no other nation came to Ofrid's aid. Then it was too late, because Abaria's military might greatened as a result of the Ofridian defeat and only an alliance of all other nations could have conquered them.  Ironically, Portox had never been captured.  Now as the tall gray tower came into view, Bontarc's mind was filled with thoughts of Portox, the Ofridian wizard. It was said that Portox had been able to travel through space to other planets that were known to exist, that he had left Tarth and found safety somewhere across space, first building his tower which would never be destroyed; that a great clock within it was measuring off one hundred years--the time on the planet Tarth of an infant's development into manhood--and that at the end of that span the "]]]
