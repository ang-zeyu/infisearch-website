Absolutely master of the case, responsible only to his conscience, and endowed with extraordinary powers, he proceeds as he thinks best. But, in this affair at Valpinson, M. Galpin had been carried away by the rapidity of the events themselves. Since the first question addressed to Cocoleu, up to the present moment, he had not had time to consider. And his proceedings had been public; thus he felt naturally tempted to explain them.  “And you call this a legal inquiry?” asked Dr. Seignebos.  He had taken off his spectacles, and was wiping them furiously.  “An inquiry founded upon what?” he went on with such vehemence that no one dared interrupt him,--“founded upon the evidence of an unfortunate creature, whom I, a physician, testify to be not responsible for what he says. Reason does not go out and become lighted again, like the gas in a street-lamp. A man is an idiot, or he is not an idiot. He has always been one; and he always will be one. But you say the other statements are conclusive. Say, rather, that you think they are. Why? Because you are prejudiced by Cocoleu’s accusation. But for it, you would never have troubled yourselves about what M. De Boiscoran did, or did not. He walked about the whole evening. He has a right to do so. He crossed the marsh. What hindered him? He went through the woods. Why should he not? He is met with by people. Is not that quite natural? But no: an idiot accuses him, and forthwith all he does looks suspicious. He talks. It is the insolence of a hardened criminal. He is silent. It is the remorse of a guilty man trembling with fear. Instead of naming M. de Boiscoran, Cocoleu might just as well have named me, Dr. Seignebos. At once, all my doings would have appeared suspicious; and I am quite sure a thousand evidences of my guilt would have been discovered. It would have been an easy matter. Are not my opinions more radical even than those of M. de Boiscoran? For there is the key to the whole matter. M. de Boiscoran is a Republican; M. de Boiscoran acknowledges no sovereignty but that of the people”--  “Doctor,” broke in the commonwealth attorney,--“doctor, you are not thinking of what you say.”  “I do think of it, I assure you”--  But he was once more interrupted, and this time by Count Claudieuse, who said,--  “For my part, I admit all the arguments brought up by the magistrate. But, above all probabilities, I put a fact,--the character of the accused. M. de Boiscoran is a man of honor and an excellent man. He is incapable of committing a mean and odious crime.”  The others assented. M. Seneschal added,--  “And I, I will tell you another thing. What would have been the purpose of such a crime? Ah, if M. de Boiscoran had nothing to lose! But do you know among all your friends a happier man than he is?--young, handsome, in excellent health, immensely wealthy, esteemed and popular with everybody. Finally, there is another fact, which is a family secret, but which I may tell you, and which will remove at once all suspicions,--M. de Boiscoran is desperately in love with Miss Dionysia de Chandore. She returns his love; and the day before yesterday the wedding-day was fixed on the 20th of the next month.”  In the meantime the hours had sped on. It was half-past three by the clock of the church in Brechy. Day was breaking; and the light of the lamps was turning pale. The morning mists began to disappear; and the sunlight fell upon the window-panes. But no one noticed this: all these men gathered around the bed of the wounded man were too deeply excited. M. Galpin had listened to the objection made by the others, without a word or a gesture. He had so far recovered his self-control, that it would have been difficult to see what impressions they made upon his mind. At last, shaking his head gravely, he said,--  “More than you, gentlemen, I feel a desire to believe M. de Boiscoran innocent. M. Daubigeon, who knows what I mean, will tell you so. In my heart I pleaded his cause long before you. But I am the representative of the law; and my duty is above my affections. Does it depend on me to set aside Cocoleu’s accusation, however stupid, however absurd, it may be? Can I undo the three statements made by the witnesses, and confirming so strongly the suspicions aroused by the first charge?”  Count Claudieuse was distressed beyond expression. At last he said,--  “The worst thing about it is, that M. de Boiscoran thinks I am his enemy. I should not wonder if he went and imagined that these charges and vile suspicions have been suggested by my wife or by myself. If I could only get up! At least, let M. de Boiscoran know distinctly that I am ready to answer for him, as I would answer for myself. Cocoleu, the wretched idiot! Ah, Genevieve, my darling wife! Why did you induce him to talk? If you had not insisted, he would have kept silent forever.”  The countess succumbed at last to the anxieties of this terrible night. At first she had been supported by that exaltation which is apt to accompany a great crisis; but latterly she had felt exhausted. She had sunk upon a stool, near the bed on which her two daughters were lying; and, her head hid in the pillow, she seemed to sleep. But she was not asleep. When her husband reproached her thus, she rose, pale, with swollen eyes and distorted features, and said in a piercing voice,--  “What? They have tried to kill my Trivulce; our children have been near unto death in the flames; and I should have allowed any means to be unused by which the guilty one may be found out? No! I have only done what it was my duty to do. Whatever may come of it, I regret nothing.”  “But, Genevieve, M. de Boiscoran is not guilty: he cannot possibly be guilty. How could a man who has the happiness of being loved by Dionysia de Chandore, and who counts the days to his wedding,--how could he devise such a hideous crime?”  “Let him prove his innocence,” replied the countess mercilessly.  The doctor smacked his lips in the most impertinent manner.  “There is a woman’s logic for you,” he murmured.  “Certainly,” said M. Seneschal, “M. de Boiscoran’s innocence will be promptly established. Nevertheless, the suspicion will remain. And our people are so constituted, that this suspicion will overshadow his whole life. Twenty years hence, they will meet him, and they will say, ‘Oh, yes! the man who set Valpinson on fire!’”  It was not M. Galpin this time who replied, but the commonwealth attorney. He said sadly,--  “I cannot share your views; but that does not matter. After what has passed, our friend, M. Galpin cannot retrace his steps: his duty makes that impossible, and, even more so, what is due to the accused. What would all these people say, who have heard Cocoleu’s deposition, and the evidence given by the witnesses, if the inquiry were stopped? They would certainly say M. de Boiscoran was guilty, but that he was not held responsible because he was rich and noble. Upon my honor I believe him to be innocent. But precisely because this is my conviction, I maintain that his innocence must be clearly established. No doubt he has the means of doing so. When he met Ribot, he told him he was on his way to see somebody at Brechy.”  “But suppose he never went there?” objected M. Seneschal. “Suppose he did not see anybody there? Suppose it was only a pretext to satisfy Ribot’s impertinent curiosity?”  “Well, then, he would only have to tell the truth in court. And look! Here’s an important proof which almost by itself relieves M. de Boiscoran. Would he not have loaded his gun with a ball, if he should ever have really thought of murdering the count? But it was loaded with nothing but small-shot.”  “And he would never have missed me at ten yards’ distance,” said the count.  Suddenly somebody was heard knocking furiously at the door.  “Come in!” cried M. Seneschal.  The door opened and three peasants appeared, looking bewildered, but evidently well pleased.  “We have just,” said one of them, “found something curious.”  “What?” asked M. Galpin.  “It looks very much like a case; but Pitard says it is the paper of a cartridge.”  Count Claudieuse raised himself on his pillows, and said eagerly,--  “Let me see! I have during these last days fired several times quite near to the house to frighten the birds away that eat my fruit. I want to see if the paper is mine.”  The peasant gave it to him.  It was a very thin lead form, such as contain the cartridges used in American breech-loading guns. What was singular was that it was blackened by burnt powder; but it had not been torn, nor had it blazed up in the discharge. It was so perfectly uninjured, that one could read the embossed letters of the name of the manufacturer, Clebb.  “That cartridge never belonged to me,” said the count.  But as he uttered these words he turned deadly pale, so pale, that his wife came close to him, and looked at him with a glance full of terrible anguish.  “Well?”  He made no reply.  But at that moment such silence was so eloquent, that the countess felt sickened, and whispered to him,--  “Then Cocoleu was right, after all!”  Not one feature of this dramatic scene had escaped M. Galpin’s eye. He had seen on every face signs of a kind of terror; still he made no remark. He took the metal case from the count’s hands, knowing that it might become an important piece of evidence; and for nearly a minute he turned it round and round, looking at it from all sides, and examining it in the light with the utmost attention.  Then turning to the peasants, who were standing respectfully and uncovered close by the door, he asked them,--  “Where did you find this cartridge, my friends?”  “Close by the old tower, where they keep the tools, and where the ivy is growing all over the old castle.”  M. Seneschal had in the meantime succeeded in recovering his self-control, and said now,--  “Surely the murderer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33364"],["title","A New Subspecies of the Fruit-eating Bat, Sturnira ludovici, From Western Mexico (#0)"],["body","OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY  Volume 14, No. 16, pp. 475-481, 1 fig.

KNOX JONES, JR., AND GARY L. PHILLIPS   The fruit-eating bats of the genus _Sturnira_ are represented on the North American mainland by two species, _S. lilium_ and _S. ludovici_. The former, in most areas the smaller of the two, is widely distributed in México and Central America and is common in many places. On the other hand, _S. ludovici_, described by Anthony (1924:8) from near Gualea, Ecuador, generally has been regarded as rare; insofar as we can determine only 20 specimens of the species have been recorded previously from North America (Costa Rica, Honduras, and México).  In 1961 (M. Raymond Lee) and 1962 (Percy L. Clifton), field representatives of the Museum of Natural History collected mammals in western México. Among the bats obtained by them were 23 specimens of _S. ludovici_, which represent an heretofore undetected subspecies that is named and described below.   Sturnira ludovici occidentalis, new subspecies  _Holotype._--Adult female, skin and skull, no. 92798 Museum of Natural History, The University of Kansas, from Plumosas, 2500 feet elevation, Sinaloa; obtained on August 31, 1962, by Percy L. Clifton (original no. 2939).  _Distribution._--Western México; known certainly from south-western Durango south to southern Jalisco (see Fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Size small both externally and cranially (forearm in adults 40.4-44.1 mm., greatest length of skull 21.7-22.9); rostrum short and abruptly elevated; skull relatively broad; dorsal pelage drab brownish over-all, usually lacking epaulets (pale yellowish brown when present); ventral pelage brownish gray.  _Comparisons._--From _Sturnira ludovici ludovici_, the only other subspecies of the species, _S. l. occidentalis_ differs in averaging smaller in most external and cranial dimensions (in some measurements the upper size limits of _occidentalis_ barely overlap the lower limits in specimens of _ludovici_ examined), in having a relatively broader skull with a shorter, more abruptly elevated rostrum, and in being paler both dorsally and ventrally.  From _Sturnira lilium parvidens_, with which it is sympatric, _S. l. occidentalis_ usually (but not always) differs in being brownish (rather than yellowish to yellowish orange) dorsally and in lacking epaulets, and differs in the following cranial features: first upper incisors simple (rather than weakly bifid in unworn condition), larger, and more nearly straight when viewed from the front; second upper incisors reduced; lower incisors bilobate rather than trilobate; lingual cusps on m1 and m2 greatly reduced; M2 usually turned inward from M1 at distinct angle. The two species have approximately the same external and cranial dimensions in western México.  _Measurements_ (in millimeters).--External measurements of the holotype are as follows: total length, 58; length of hind foot, 15; length of ear, 18; forearm (average of both), 42.5. Corresponding average and extreme measurements of 11 adults from 4 km. N Durazno, Jalisco, followed by those of eight adults from 17 km. SE Talpa, Jalisco, are: 61.9 (59-65), 60.9 (57-68); 14.1 (12-15), 13.0 (13); 16.1 (15-18), 16.0 (15-17); 42.2 (40.4-43.8), 42.9 (41.6-44.1); weight in grams, 16.8 (15-19, six specimens only), 19.2 (16.3-22.5).  Cranial measurements of the holotype additional to those given in Table 1 are: condyloincisive length, 19.7; breadth across upper canines, 5.5; length of mandibular tooth-row (c-m3), 6.7.  _Remarks._--The pattern of geographic variation in size in _Sturnira ludovici_ resembles that in many other species of tropical bats in North America in that individuals from the northern parts of the range are smaller than those from the south. Mexican specimens herein assigned to _S. l. ludovici_ average somewhat smaller than specimens from Central America and the northern part of South America (but are within the currently understood size limits of that subspecies) and average paler as well. Additional material is needed from central and eastern México before the limits of distribution of the two subspecies of _ludovici_ can be determined accurately.  All specimens examined of the new subspecies were trapped in mist nets. The holotype was captured in a net stretched across an old road among large fruit trees situated along a small river (a tributary of the Río del Baluarte). Tropical deciduous vegetation grew in the narrow valley of the river but the adjacent hills supported oak. A specimen of _Artibeus jamaicensis jamaicensis_ was netted along with the holotype and on the previous night, August 30, one individual each of _Glossophaga soricina leachii_ and _Sturnira lilium parvidens_ were taken in the same net. Baker and Greer (1962:69) also reported the two species of _Sturnira_ as netted together 6 mi. S Pueblo Nuevo in adjacent Durango.
