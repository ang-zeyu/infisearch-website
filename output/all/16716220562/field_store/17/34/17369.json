He had been on the paper for five years; he had started in as night reporter, and his own ability and quickness, united with a certain caution, one might call it a news integrity, had raised him to his present position. The _Planet_ had the singular reputation of printing the truth. It rarely was \"taken in,\" with a false item. It aspired far beyond the local.  The _Planet_, under the able management of its chief and of Swift, had become the mirror of the world. And, if at times it reflected important news from a convex surface, it did no more and far less than the majority of its contemporaries, who had no telegraphic facts to throw away daily, and who, when hard pressed to it, manufactured a murder at home or a war rumor abroad to help pad their lean columns.  \"Let me see! It is five forty-five,\" continued the chief, consulting his watch. \"I will not detain you any longer, Mr. Ticks. We shall want a column from you on Russell, to-night. And now, Swift,\"--when Mr. Ticks had faded out of the room,--\"who's this correspondent signed D.?\"  \"It's Dubbs. You know him. Associated press man and special correspondent. Never failed me. He's the only one there who knows our cipher.\"  The editor-in-chief did not change his expression, but his eyes had the steady, stern look that showed easy determination. He quickly wrote a few words on his pad and handed them to his favorite \"sub.\"  \"Take this to the cashier! Get to the elevated as fast as you can! Buy what you need when you get time, and--_go!_ I depend on you for the fullest description to be had. If you do as well as you did on the Conemaugh, I'll give you a raise on your return. Good luck to you.\"  It did not take Mr. Swift five minutes to rush to his den, slip on his coat, snatch his hat from the floor, run downstairs, receive a fat roll of bills from the phlegmatic cashier and bolt for the elevated train. In twenty-five minutes he was at the central station, with two minutes to spare. He nodded pleasantly to the gatekeeper and boarded the train as nonchalantly as if he were going to his suburban boarding-house.     II.   All of our readers will remember the curiosity, the speculation, the horror, the apprehension, and the sympathy universally excited when, on the tenth of September, it was learned from the morning papers that Russell, the new capital of Harrison, was cut off from all communication. Each morning sheet hinted darkly at the cause of this unheard-of calamity. The _Daily Braggart_ said there was no doubt that a cyclone of gigantic proportions, followed by a water-spout, had swept the city entirely away, and that its evening edition would print full details of the \"awful visitation,\" with pictures by their special artists, now on the spot, illustrating the ruin.  Rut there was one piece of additional news about Russell that only the _Daily Planet_ gave. Let us quote, in order to be perfectly accurate. The sheet is before us as we write:       \"EXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY!       \"RUSSELL CUT OFF FROM ALL COMMUNICATION!       \"_The citizens of the State of Harrison are wild with      apprehension. As yet we cannot speculate on the nature of this      disaster. Up to this moment no one knows what it is. We will be      honest, and say we know no more than our neighbors. But this      much is assured: Not only is communication cut off within a      radius of twenty miles of the ill-fated city, but it is      impossible to re-establish it at present. There are forces at      work as yet uncatalogued by scientists. There is a definite      circle drawn about Russell, and to cross it means death. Two      men repairing the C. H. & S. F. tracks dropped, smitten by a      mysterious and invisible hand. The white mile post announced      that Russell was twenty miles from the spot where the corpses      of these brave fellows lay. What baneful miasma envelops this      broad area? What is the fate of the thousands within its      borders? Time will tell. Our reporters are on the spot. But as      we go to press we do not know._\"  Most people sniffed at this \"dead line\" as the wildest newspaper canard of the lot. Many shook their heads. While those who had relatives or friends or business connections in Russell tried to drown their horrible suspense as best they could.  The _Planet_, it may be remembered, closed its leading editorial as follows:       \"_We are a Democratic paper, and we had little love for this      baby State and its upstart capital, created solely to guarantee      a Republican majority at the next presidential election. But      when the news that an inscrutable fate had overtaken this      fraudulent State (we may be pardoned for saying that it seems      to us a sort of Divine retribution for political jobbery) party      feeling was washed away in that common compassion that all      Christians feel for their enemies in adversity._\"  Who could mistake the diction of the uncompromising but tender chief?  But it happened this time, as so often before, that the _Planet's_ information was true. Again that enterprising daily had made its \"scoop\" on the other papers. Its elation was pardonable.  It is an indisputable fact that civilization as it progresses develops in its advance new diseases and new catastrophes. Hay fever and la grippe were not popular a hundred years ago. To breed a first-class cyclone, cut down your trees and dry up your water supply. This has been conscientiously attended to, and the natural consequences have followed. Science can eliminate the simooms that strike Bombay and Calcutta at such a day year after year, by simply flooding the desert of Sahara. England can be more easily conquered by deflecting the Gulf Stream a quarter of a point than by a thousand ironclads. Who knows but that it would be less expensive to change her into a glacier than to bombard her with hundred-ton guns?  More white people are killed by railroad accidents yearly in our highly civilized land than were slaughtered by native braves in the palmy days of the \"Last of the Mohicans.\" It is a fact that our boasted civilization, instead of affording surer protection, murders more men in one way or another than barbarism, only in the present case the victims are not eaten; the coffins are sumptuous; the processions decorous; the mourners in good form; the burial service pregnant with hope, and culture is not shocked. With us murder is committed by corporations, not by paid assassins. That is the difference. The assassin fails in his blows once in a while; the corporation never.  But where was Russell? What was the nature of the calamity? The impenetrable fact that there was an actual, invisible dead line cast about that territory, with Russell as its centre, became confirmed with every report. It will be recalled that all the railroad tracks entering the doomed city were twisted as if clawed by a maddened monster. It presented a similar appearance to the South Carolina railroad on the day of the Charleston earthquake. This gave rise again to the earthquake theory. But why had not the shock been felt? No rumble had been heard. Could an earthquake account for the deadly something that filled the air?  No intelligence came from Russell. The way must be forced to it.  Who forgets the relief expeditions started in wagons and on foot from every point of the compass? These were invariably repelled on reaching the dead line. We could understand the fetid miasma that made the Great Dismal Swamp an unknowable country. We could comprehend the encroaching dead line of the spreading yellow fever bacillus. But this fearful death, that brooded silently, impenetrably, mysteriously and occultly over a vast area once the garden of civilization, baffled all attempts at explanation. Even birds were observed to vacate this tract. Only a few sinister buzzards wheeled their flight, with straight, unflapping wings, high above Russell, almost out of sight, as if they were the embodied ghosts of Russell's unbaptized inhabitants.  What was that implacable power? Reporters and trackmen who steadily scoffed at it were themselves attacked with violent heart-beats when they crossed the invisible and fatal line. A convulsion of all the members followed, as if in an epileptic fit,--insensibility and, generally, death ensued. Many who were with difficulty rescued, and who finally recovered, averred that they experienced an overcoming odor, acid and penetrating, such as is peculiar to ozone when manufactured in a chemical laboratory.  At the end of the fourth day of Russell's complete isolation a despair settled upon the country. England was staggered by the uniqueness of these phenomena. The French Academy of Sciences, after a prolonged sitting, announced that they could suggest no solution. It is only too well remembered that the newspaper bulletins were besieged in our own cities, but these offered no further information or encouragement. Was advanced civilization responsible for this disaster or not? That was the burning question. Or was this a special visitation of God, a plague new to the medical world, spontaneously generated, sporadic in its appearance, and destined forever to be an _obscurum per obscurius_ or perhaps to spread with further undetermined horrors?  Thousands were now on the ground. They encompassed that section about as Joshua did the city of Jericho, as the settlers did the Territory of Oklahoma on the day of its opening, as the rabble do a house when a murder has been committed.  On the evening of the fourth day from the time when the messenger boy brought the first despatch to the office of the _Daily Planet_, its chief, obviously nervous for the first time in his public life, received the following cipher telegram, which cheered him wonderfully:       \"_On the spot. Situation desperate. Worse than described. Will      penetrate to Russell or die. Dead line still impassable. Trust      me._       \"SWI"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],["title","A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#8)"],["body","FT\"     III.   When Swift boarded the Western express he walked through, starting from the last car, to see if any rival reporters happened to be there for the same purpose. He scanned the backs of the heads of the passengers first, and then looked keenly into each man's face as he passed. He had, in common with all newspaper men, the detective instinct. Who knew what eminent defaulter or renowned cracksman was fleeing the city in dark disguise? However, he observed no familiar or suspicious character until he entered the smoking car.  He did not go through, for, although a great smoker, he took no pleasure in indulging in his favorite vice in the air of a democratic smoking car. What fastidious smoker does? He was content to let his eyes wander up and down the aisle. He was about to turn, when his gaze fell upon the back of a dingy linen duster, which was surmounted by a large, faded, black sombrero. The man under these garments had the upper part of his face hidden beneath the broad flap of his hat, while the under part of his face was entirely submerged in a large pamphlet. The man had the air of extreme retirement. Something about the dinginess of the felt hat seemed familiar to Swift. But, no; it could not be. To make sure, the new editor of the _Planet_ approached, and bent behind the man. The gentleman was ignorant of the attention he attracted, and did not stir. He seemed to be engrossed in one of Mr. Atkinson's incomprehensible financial reports. Swift caught sight of the travellers face, started back in amazement, and said:  \"Excuse me, sir: is this seat engaged?\" and without further ceremony sat down beside the recondite stranger, who dropped his paper and stared at Swift in return.  \"Great Cæsar!\" blurted out Swift. \"How the D--epartment did you come here?\"  \"On the five fifty-eight elevated,\" replied the man, imperturbably.  \"I--I didn't know you were sent, too.\" Swift's heart burned within him at the fancied slight.  \"I wasn't,\" answered Mr. Statis Ticks, laconically and wearily.  \"Where the dickens are you going, then?\" asked Swift, warmly.  \"To Russell, of course.\"  \"How on earth did you get off?\"  \"I didn't, young man. I skipped.\" This exceptional occasion doubtless accounted for the only bit of slang that was ever heard to fall from those dry lips. \"You see,\" proceeded Mr. Ticks drearily, \"the circumstance is a little unusual. I have read of nothing similar in the casualty reports. I thought it best for my reputation to make my own personal observations and figures on the spot.\"  \"But your position?\" asked Swift in surprise.  Mr. Statis Ticks raised his head proudly.  \"If the _Planet_ can get on without me, let it!\"  \"But your family?\" continued Swift, somewhat dazed. Who had suspected this animated reference library of such enterprise?  \"I sent messenger number thirty-seven to them,\" he answered with a sigh, as if he were bored by such trifles.  Then considering this topic exhausted, Mr. Ticks took out his notebook and looked absently out of the window; now and then he jotted down a few abstruse figures. He was engrossed in calculating the farm acreage adjacent to the railroad track between New York and Albany.  When they drew nearer to the region of the catastrophe the papers gave more lurid accounts of it. These were purchased and read with avidity by those on board the flying express. Groups centred in the cars talked only of one thing. Reporters now joined the train at each prominent city.  As the train approached the stricken territory it became crammed to suffocation. It crept at a funeral pace. People fought at each station for seats. The train split into sections on account of the added cars, filled with mourners, with rescuers, with sight-seers, with villains.  Swift now took to himself a certain measure of authority. Was he not the experienced representative of the greatest daily in America? But no one noticed Mr. Statis Ticks, who silently blinked at the excited crowds and then jotted down his estimates of them.  On the afternoon of the fourth day Swift bounded from the front platform of the baggage car, the first to leave the train, and looked with a professional eye about him. The scene that met his quick gaze was unprecedented. Clamoring, gesticulating, shrieking, crying men and women were rushing here and there in frenzy. Here was a group of women wailing for their husbands, imprisoned or dead--and who knew which?--within that awful circle. There a man looked, vacantly, with trembling lips, from group to group, hunting for the wife snatched from him. Here was a rude fellow peddling half a bushel of potatoes from a rickety farm wagon. There a woman, hungry and desperate, was aimlessly dragging an orphan child about. Yonder a confidence man was set upon and beaten by infuriated victims. In the midst of a jostling, eager, credulous mob was a man who fancied he had some real news to tell.  Now and then, as if by mutual consent, these people lifted up their heads towards the Great Buzzard mountains, toward Russell, the city of their despair, and clenched their fists and uttered an exasperated groan. Agents of the Red Cross Society and of the Law and Order League had already erected their tents, and were doing all they could to restrain the lawlessness and relieve the discomforts of the mob. Swift critically watched these seething thousands, who had come upon the spot from motives of sorrow, curiosity, gain, and plunder, all miserable, poorly housed and scantily fed. The reporter's inquisitiveness was well ahead of his human sympathy up to this point.  Within these few days the border line about the afflicted city had become an improvised camp, that extended for miles and miles. It was enforced here by a railroad track, there by a village, until, having completed the gigantic circle, it met again. Thousands were flowing in each hour. They came from all points of the compass, like flocks of angels and of devils. As yet the military was not at hand, and the little law that existed was not of the gospel, but of brute force and adroitness.  Swift, having sent off his dispatch at the improvised office, and having forgotten his companion, whom he expected to be a nuisance on his hands, retraced his steps and hurried to the dead line, where it impinged on the railroad track. Here was the centre of the maddest rush. Here men groaned and cursed and wept aloud. Swift pushed his way through until he reached that portion of the track that defied further passage. A cord had been stretched there to keep the crowds back. Upon showing his badge he was received with respect.  \"Take keer, boss,\" said the huge policeman, whose sole duty up to this time had been to drive the spikes into the sleepers. \"I tried it yesterday. They just pulled me out. I got the d--d shakes yet.\" With a grave smile Swift ducked under the rope and looked before him. The solitary, motionless, blasted prairie stretched out, relieved only by the outlines of the Buzzard mountains. Where once the tops of towers, grain elevators and steeples were to be seen on the horizon, there was a cloud. A dense, strange, ominous mist overhung the stricken city.  This cloud was of a yellowish color that recalled to Swift the dreadful yellow day of '72. It reached nearly to the summit of the great Buzzard mountain. Within five miles of the spot on which he stood this phenomenon became more and more attenuated until it disappeared in dull transparency. What did that cloud contain? What horrors did it hide? Of what was its nature? What was the secret of its deadly influence? No American catastrophe had impressed the reporter so much as the sight of this veil, hiding the unattainable city. Curse this maledict, deadly vapor! It paralyzed his inventiveness. It baffled his imagination. For the first time in his reportorial career Swift was stunned and without resource.  Now it was said that not a breath of air had stirred over the polluted area since the morning of the loss of Russell.  As the news editor looked down the tracks he saw that the tracks, which were torn up and twisted beneath him, within a hundred feet, disappeared utterly from view. The wooden ties were blackened into charcoal in their places, but the iron rails had evaporated. It was the same with the telegraph wires. At a certain point they stopped and were gone. The poles, tottering and scorched and bare, looked like a procession of naked ghosts, undressed for livelier mockery. Before him the trees, the shrubs, the grain, the grasses--in fine, all vegetation had been smitten unto death.  The face of the earth was black and crumbling. It looked as if the roots of this unconscious vegetable life had been suddenly touched by volcanic fires and had died from the ground up. There was not a vestige of life as far as the eye could see. Had a fire swept the land? But no! No smoke had been hitherto visible, unless this inexplicable cloud were smoke. And yet, to Swift's practiced eye, there were evidences of a violent, a sudden, a consuming heat. The men in line behind Swift stood respectfully back while he observed this unique scene. He noticed a white mile-post close at hand. It was inscribed, \"Russell, 20 m.\"  \"Only twenty miles to Russell! and no one there yet! What a field for the news editor of the greatest paper in the land! The competitors were keen. The chances were even, the honor great, and no favors asked. As he stood for a moment, lost in thought over the apparent hopelessness of the undertaking, and almost wishing he had not sent so confident a telegram to his chief, he felt a hand upon his arm.  \"I have found one,\" said a slow voice.  \"Have you? What?\" asked Swift, with careless interest. He recognized the aspirated tones of Mr. Ticks.  \"I have calculated this thing over. There are between six and seven thousand on the spot. Five hundred reporters are here, and more expected by every train. There is no food, no bed, no roof for us here. This place has been completely done up. "]]]
