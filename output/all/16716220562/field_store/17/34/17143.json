CHAPTER VII  THE EXAMPLE OF A GIRL   Slowly the transport, which was called The Gem, steamed down the river and Jeanne stayed on deck long hours to watch the scenery, which was new and strange to her. The river was full of devious windings and the girl was amazed at its great bends and loops, and sometimes it seemed to her that the turns must bring them back to Memphis. The eastern shore bounded by the lofty plains of Tennessee and Mississippi terminating at times in precipitous bluffs afforded a great contrast to the flat lands of the western bank. The dense forests of cottonwood, sweet gum, magnolia, sycamore and tulip trees festooned with long gray streamers of moss were interspersed with cypress swamps and a network of bayous.  \"Whar you bin dat you ain't nebber seed no 'nolias befo'?\" queried Tennessee as she listened to Jeanne's expressions of admiration as a particularly handsome clump of magnolias came into view on the western bank. The channel of the river at this point ran so close to the shore that the perfume of the creamy blossoms was very perceptible.  \"I've always lived in New York City,\" replied Jeanne. \"I saw some magnolia trees once in Maryland, but I never saw them in blossom. Aren't they beautiful?\"  \"Yes, honey. Dey is purty fer a fac',\" replied the negress. \"I allers laked de 'nolias myself, and dat wuz de reason dat I named my darter so, but we called her Snowball fer short.\"  \"You did?\" laughed Jeanne. \"Why, Tenny, Snowball isn't any shorter than Magnolia. Why didn't you call her 'Nolia,' if you wished to shorten the name?\"  \"My ole marster, he done it,\" was the reply. \"Ole marster say, 'Tenny, dat li'l pickaninny too white ter be named anything so yaller as a magnolia. Better call her Snowball.' Ole marster allers would hab his joke, and dat gal of mine wuz jist as brack as de nex' one. I didn't want my chile called Snowball. It wuzn't stylish nohow, but would you b'lebe me, chile? De fust thing I knowed, white and culled wuz a callin' her Snowball, an' den I did, too.\"  \"Where is she now, Tenny? I should think you would want her with you on these trips.\"  \"Chile, chile, dat's de thing dat tears dis hyar old heart ob mine,\" said the woman, her eyes filling with tears. \"Ole marster say she was a 'likely gal' an' she wuz, ef she wuz mine. Dey made much ob her and would hab her roun' dem all de time. Seem laik nobody could do for 'em laik Snowball. Den ole marster tuk sick and died an' ole missus she say she hab ter sell us all, kase she didn't hab no money any mo'. An' Massa Cap'n he bought me but 'nother man bought Snowball an' tuk her down to Loosyanny.\"  \"Why, that is awful!\" cried Jeanne, her eyes overflowing, her heart full of sympathy for the darky. She had often heard tales of this kind but this was the first time that this phase of slavery had been brought home to her. A child torn from its mother appealed to her, so many miles from her own dear mother, as nothing else could have done. \"Why didn't Captain Leathers buy her too?\" she asked. \"He seems like a kind man.\"  \"He is, honey. 'Deed he is,\" replied Tenny wiping her eyes, \"an' he did try, but the yudder man had bought her fust an' he wouldn't gib her up. I can't blame him fer she wuz a likely gal. Lawsie, chile, dat gal wuz smarter'n a whip!\"  \"How long has she been gone, Tenny?\"  \"'Twas befo' de wah broke out. Massa Cap'n he wanted a good cook, an' I sutinly am dat, so he tuk me. He say dat I'se ter hab my freedum too, but shucks! what's freedum ter me? I'd rudder hab my gal dan all de freedum in de world.\"  \"Yes; I suppose so,\" said Jeanne dreamily. \"Still, Tenny, if you had your freedom you could go to look for Snowball.\"  \"Now, missy, what could Tenny do? A pore ole nigger can't do nuffin nohow. S'pose I did fin' her, what's I gwine ter do 'bout it? I couldn't buy her. 'Sides, ef dey cot an ole 'ooman a foolin' roun' dat didn't seem ter 'long ter nobody dey lock me up, suah. Mebbe dey'd whip me. An', chile, once you had de whip ter yer back you doesn't want it no mo'. No; I'se gwine ter stay right with Massa Cap'n. He's a good marster, an' he'll take good keer ob Tenny.\"  Jeanne sat silently thinking over what she had heard. Her heart ached for the helpless mother and she chafed at her inability to aid her. The darkness of the great slavery evil fell upon her spirit. Was this the land of the free and the home of the brave? she mused. How could she ever sing \"The Star Spangled Banner\" again so long as it waved over a country a portion of whose inhabitants groaned under a yoke of bondage!  \"'Spect I ortern't ter hab tole yer dis, chile,\" said Tenny, becoming alarmed at her silence. \"A nigga's trubbles nuffin nohow. Done you bodder yer purty haid ober it. I'se sorry I tole yer.\"  \"I am glad, Tenny, but I do feel so sorry for you. I wish I could help you. If I knew where the man was that bought your child I'd buy her back and give her to you. Then if Captain Leathers would set you free you could both go North and nobody could ever separate you again.\"  \"Bress yer good haht, honey!\" exclaimed Tenny, clapping her hands. \"I wish I knowed his name. He wus an horsifer. I heerd dem call him Kuhnel.\"  \"And don't you remember his name?\"  \"No, missy; I doesn't. Nebber heerd him called nuffin but Kuhnel nohow. Wait a minnit! Chile, chile, 'pears ter me I did hyar it. Lemme think. My ole haid no 'count no mo'.\" She placed her hands to her head and looked with troubled eyes at Jeanne. \"Why can't I 'member? 'Twuzn't Massa Benson? No; 'twuzn't. Think, nigga! Why done yer 'zert yersef? Nebber did hab no sense nohow.\"  Thus she rambled on, muttering to herself until presently she sprang to her feet exclaiming:  \"I'se got it, missy. 'Twuz Kuhnel Peyton. Massa Kuhnel Peyton! I 'members it now 'zactly. Massa Kuhnel Peyton! Dat's it. Dat's it.\"  \"Colonel Peyton!\" said Jeanne. \"I'll remember that name, Tenny. How much do you suppose the Colonel would want for her?\"  \"'Bout a tousand dollahs, I reckon,\" answered Tenny.  \"A thousand dollars,\" echoed Jeanne in dismay. \"Oh, Tenny, I haven't near that much. I didn't suppose that it would be so much as that.\"  \"Niggas wuth heaps ob money,\" said Tenny proudly. \"My gal wuz smaht, I tell yer. Dat's why she brung so much. Can't you buy her, missy? Tenny'll lub yer all yer life ef yer will.\"  \"I'll write to my father,\" decided Jeanne. \"I'll get him to buy her for me. He will know just what to do, and you shall have your child again, Tenny, I'll promise you that.\"  \"Ef yer'll jest do that, missy, ole Tenny'll do anything in de wohld fer yer,\" sobbing in her eagerness. \"To think ob habin' my babby ergain. She wuz my babby, missy. I had ten befo' her but 'peared laik none ob dem tuk sich a hole on ma haht de way she did. Ef I kin hab her ergain I'll brack yer shoes, an' scrub yer floors er do anything all de res' ob ma life. Yer won't need ter lift yer purty white han's ter do er a lick er wuk nebber no mo'.\"  \"I'll do it if it is possible,\" said Jeanne. \"It may take some time to find the Colonel, Tenny. You know that the war has disturbed everything so, but my father will know just what to do. If anybody can find him I know that he can. Just hope and pray that it will all come right yet.\"  \"I'll do dat, honey. I'se been prayin' fer dis long time, but I didn't do no hopin' kase it didn't seem no use. But bress yer! De Lohd seems 'bout ter lead me outen de valley ob de shadder. Massa Cap'n say sumtime we all be free, but dat's too much ter hope fer.\"  \"No; it isn't, Tenny. The people up North are talking about it all the time and working for it. I should not be surprised if it were to happen any time.\"  \"Glory!\" shouted the old woman rapturously. \"Den dere wouldn't be no mo' whippin's, ner chilluns sold frum der mammies, ner hidin's in de swamp wid de dogs arter yer, ner put in jail ef yer does run away. Oh, chile, it'll be de bressed day ef it do happen! But it can't be true.\"  \"Hope for it, Tenny. That is what we are doing, but it grows late and I believe that I am tired. Would you mind going with me to the cabin while I go to bed? Someway I feel lonesome to-night.\"  \"'Course yer lonesum. Way offen yer folks laik dis. Suttinly I'll go an' only too glad. Ole Tenny'll put yer ter bed laik she wuz yer own mammy.\" She bustled about the girl when they reached the latter's stateroom and soon had Jeanne snugly in bed. \"Dis hyar winda'll gib yer air,\" she said opening it. \"Yer needn't be afeerd kase it opens on de ribba, and nobody can't git in. Now shet dem eyes ob yourn, and go ter sleep.\"  She sat by the girl's side and began crooning weirdly. The wild barbaric melody rising and falling in a sort of rhythm with the motion of the boat. Jeanne listened fascinated by the music and presently her eyes became heavy and soon she was fast asleep.  On and on down the tortuous curves of the river The Gem wended her way until at last she came in sight of the flotilla under the command of Commodore Davis. A shout went up from the fleet as the men caught sight of the transport, and there was a scramble for her sides as she hove to alongside of the flagship of the Commodore.  Jeanne kept herself in readiness to be transferred to one of the gunboats, for Captain Leathers had told her that he did not expect to go farther. Soon he returned from a visit to the flagship.  \"Commodore Davis says that it will not be advisable for you to come aboard any one of his ships as there are many cases of fever among the men,\" he said, coming at once to the waiting girl. \"Both Commodore Farragut's force and his own are down with it. They intend withdrawing from the assault on Vicksburg as they have received orders to that effect from Washington. Therefore Davis will retire to Helena and Farragut to New Orleans until they can have the coöperation of the army.\"  \"But----\" began Jeanne.  \"You see the thing is to get you to Farragut,\" interrupted the Captain. \"Davis and I have decided that some of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33"],["title","The Scarlet Letter (#0)"],["body","Scarlet Letter  by Nathaniel Hawthorne   Contents   THE CUSTOM-HOUSE  THE SCARLET LETTER  I.

THE REVELATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER  XXIV. CONCLUSION     THE CUSTOM-HOUSE  INTRODUCTORY TO “THE SCARLET LETTER”   It is a little remarkable, that—though disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal friends—an autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me, in addressing the public. The first time was three or four years since, when I favoured the reader—inexcusably, and for no earthly reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine—with a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an Old Manse. And now—because, beyond my deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasion—I again seize the public by the button, and talk of my three years’ experience in a Custom-House. The example of the famous “P. P., Clerk of this Parish,” was never more faithfully followed. The truth seems to be, however, that when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer’s own nature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it. It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and apprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk; and then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness, we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of ourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. To this extent, and within these limits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical, without violating either the reader’s rights or his own.  It will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a certain propriety, of a kind always recognised in literature, as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession, and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained. This, in fact—a desire to put myself in my true position as editor, or very little more, of the most prolix among the tales that make up my volume—this, and no other, is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public. In accomplishing the main purpose, it has appeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore described, together with some of the characters that move in it, among whom the author happened to make one.  In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago, in the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf—but which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way down its melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a Nova Scotia schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood—at the head, I say, of this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often overflows, and along which, at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings, the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grass—here, with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbour, stands a spacious edifice of brick. From the loftiest point of its roof, during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops, in breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and thus indicating that a civil, and not a military, post of Uncle Sam’s government is here established. Its front is ornamented with a portico of half-a-dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street. Over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with outspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect aright, a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl, she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and the general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eiderdown pillow. But she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later—oftener soon than late—is apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows.  The pavement round about the above-described edifice—which we may as well name at once as the Custom-House of the port—has grass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn by any multitudinous resort of business. In some months of the year, however, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread. Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period, before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by itself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and ship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin while their ventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of commerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at once usually from Africa or South America—or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward, there is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the granite steps. Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may greet the sea-flushed ship-master, just in port, with his vessel’s papers under his arm in a tarnished tin box. Here, too, comes his owner, cheerful, sombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold, or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities such as nobody will care to rid him of. Here, likewise—the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded, careworn merchant—we have the smart young clerk, who gets the taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sends adventures in his master’s ships, when he had better be sailing mimic boats upon a mill-pond. Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor, in quest of a protection; or the recently arrived one, pale and feeble, seeking a passport to the hospital. Nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the British provinces; a rough-looking set of tarpaulins, without the alertness of the Yankee aspect, but contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade.  Cluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time being, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. More frequently, however, on ascending the steps, you would discern— in the entry if it were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement weathers—a row of venerable figures, sitting in old-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall. Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally might be heard talking together, in voices between a speech and a snore, and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of alms-houses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labour, or anything else but their own independent exertions. These old gentlemen—seated, like Matthew at the receipt of custom, but not very liable to be summoned thence, like him, for apostolic errands—were Custom-House officers.  Furthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a certain room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty height, with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf, and the third looking across a narrow lane, and along a portion of Derby Street. All three give glimpses of the shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers, around the doors of which are generally to be seen, laughing and gossiping, clusters of old salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping of a seaport. The room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint; its floor is strewn with grey sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse; and it is easy to conclude, from the general slovenliness of the place, that this is a sanctuary into which womankind, with her tools of magic, the broom and mop,"]]]
