He read and re-read the letter with a beaming smile of delight and pride. It was not a great matter; half a dozen lines--a greeting from Seville, wishing him good luck in Madrid; anticipated congratulations for his triumphs. That letter could have gone astray without in the least compromising the woman who wrote it. \"Friend Gallardo\" at the beginning, in elegant lettering that seemed to tickle the bull-fighter's eyes, and at the end, \"Your friend, Sol\"; all in a coldly friendly style, addressing him as _you_, with an amiable tone of superiority as though the words were not from equal to equal but had descended mercifully from on high.  The bull-fighter, gazing at the letter with the adoration which a man of the people has for caste, though little versed in reading, could not escape a certain feeling of annoyance, as if he beheld himself patronized.  \"That baggage,\" he murmured. \"That woman! No one living can break her pride. Look how she talks to me--_you! you!_--and to me!\"  But happy memories brought a satisfied smile to his lips. This frigid style was for letters; these were the customs of a great lady; the precautions of a woman who had travelled over the world. His annoyance changed to admiration.  \"What that woman doesn't know! And such a cautious creature!\"  And in his smile appeared a professional satisfaction, the pride of the tamer who, appreciating the strength of the conquered wild beast, extols his own deed.  While Gallardo was admiring this letter his servant Garabato came and went, bringing clothing and boxes which he left on the bed.  He was a fellow of quiet movements and agile hands, and seemed to take no notice of the presence of the bull-fighter. For some years he had accompanied the _diestro_ on all his travels as sword-bearer. He had commenced in Seville at the same time as Gallardo, serving first as _capeador_, but the hard blows were reserved for him, while advancement and glory were for his companion. He was little, dark, and of weak muscles, and a tortuous and poorly united gash scarred with a whitish pot-hook his wrinkled, flaccid oldish face. It was from a thrust of a bull's horn which had left him almost dead in the plaza of a certain town, and to this atrocious wound others were added that disfigured the hidden parts of his body.  By a miracle he escaped with his life from his apprenticeship as a bull-fighter, and the cruellest part of it all was that the people laughed at his misfortunes, taking pleasure in seeing him stamped on and routed by the bulls. Finally his total eclipse took place, and he agreed to be the attendant, the confidential servant, of his old comrade. He was Gallardo's most fervent admirer, although he abused the confidence of intimacy by allowing himself to give advice and to criticise. Had _he_ been in his master's skin, _he_ would have done better at certain moments. Gallardo's friends found cause for laughter in the frustrated ambitions of the sword-bearer, but he paid no attention to their jokes. Renounce the bulls? Never! And so that the memory of his past should not be wholly obliterated he combed his coarse hair in shining locks over his ears and wore on the back of his head the long and sacred great lock of hair, the _coleta_ of his youthful days, the professional emblem that distinguished him from common mortals.  When Gallardo was angry with him his fierce passion always threatened this capillary adornment.  \"And thou dost wear a _coleta_, shameless one? I'm going to cut that rat's tail off for thee--brazen-face! _Maleta!_\"  Garabato received these threats with resignation, but he took his revenge by shutting himself up in the silence of a superior man, answering the joy of the master with shrugs of his shoulders when the latter, on returning from the plaza of an afternoon in a happy mood, asked him with infantile satisfaction:  \"What didst thou think of it? Did I do well, sure?\"  On account of their juvenile comradeship he retained the privilege of saying _thou_ to his master. He could not talk to the _maestro_ in any other way, but the _thou_ was accompanied by a grave gesture and an expression of ingenuous respect. His familiarity was like that of the ancient shield-bearers to the knights of adventure.  From his collar up, including the tail on the back of his head, he was a bull-fighter; the rest of his person resembled a tailor and a valet at the same time. He dressed in a suit of English cloth, a present from the _Señor_, wearing the lapels stuck full of pins, and with several threaded needles on one sleeve. His dry, dark hands possessed a feminine delicacy for handling and arranging things.  When he had placed in order all that was necessary for the master's dressing, he looked over the numerous objects to assure himself that nothing was lacking. Then he planted himself in the middle of the room and without looking at Gallardo, as if he were speaking to himself, he said in a hoarse voice and with a stubborn accent:  \"Two o'clock!\"  Gallardo lifted his head nervously, as if he had not noticed the presence of his servant until then. He put the letter in his pocket and went to the lower end of the room with a certain hesitancy, as if he wished to delay the moment of dressing.  \"Is everything ready?\"  But suddenly his pale face colored with violent emotion. His eyes opened immeasurably wide as if they had just suffered the shock of a frightful surprise.  \"What clothes hast thou laid out?\"  Garabato pointed to the bed, but before he could speak the anger of the _maestro_ fell upon him, loud and terrible.  \"Curses on thee! Dost thou know nothing of the affairs of the profession? Thou has just come from hay-making, maybe? Bull-fight in Madrid, with Miura bulls, and thou dost get me out a green costume, the same that poor Manuel el Espartero wore! My bitterest enemy couldn't do worse, thou more than shameless one! It seems as if thou wishes to see me killed, _malaje!_\"  His anger increased as he considered the enormity of this carelessness, which was like a challenge to ill fortune. To fight in Madrid in a green costume after what had happened! His eyes flashed with hostile fire as if he had just received a traitorous attack; the whites of his eyes grew red, and he seemed about to fall upon poor Garabato with his rough bull-fighter hands.  A discreet knock on the door of the room ended this scene.  \"Come in!\"  A young man entered, dressed in light clothes, with a red cravat, and carrying a Cordovan _sombrero_ in a hand beringed with great brilliants. Gallardo recognized him instantly, with that gift for remembering faces possessed by all who live before the public.  He changed suddenly from anger to smiling amiability as if the visit were a sweet surprise. It was a friend from Bilbao, an enthusiastic admirer, a champion of his glory. That was all he could remember. But his name? He met so many! What could his name be? The only thing he knew for certain was that he must address him by _thou_, for an old friendship existed between the two.  \"Sit down! What a surprise! When didst thou come? The family well?\"  And the admirer sat down with the satisfaction of a devotee who enters the sanctuary of the idol determined not to move until the last instant, gratifying himself by the attention of the bull-fighter's _thou_, and calling him _Juan_ at every two words so that furniture, walls, and whoever might pass along the corridor should know of his intimacy with the great man. He had arrived from Bilbao this morning and would return on the following day. He took the trip for no other purpose than to see Gallardo. He had read of his great exploits; the season was beginning well; this afternoon would be fine! He had been at the sorting of the bulls where he had especially noticed a dark beast that would undoubtedly yield great sport in Gallardo's hands.  \"What costume shall I get out?\" interrupted Garabato, with a voice that seemed even more hoarse with the desire to show himself submissive.  \"The red one, the tobacco-colored, the blue--any one thou wishest.\"  Another knock sounded on the door and a new visitor appeared. It was Doctor Ruiz, the popular physician who for thirty years had been signing the medical certificates of all the injured and treating every bull-fighter that fell wounded in the plaza of Madrid.  Gallardo admired him and regarded him as the highest representative of universal science, although he indulged in good-natured jokes about his kindly disposition and his lack of care in his dress. His admiration was like that of the populace which only recognizes wisdom in a man of ill appearance and oddity of character that makes him different from ordinary mortals.  \"He is a saint,\" Gallardo used to say, \"a wise fellow, with wheels in his head, but as good as good bread, and he never has a _peseta_. He gives away all he has and he accepts whatever they choose to give him.\"  Two grand passions animated the doctor's life, revolution and bulls. A vague and tremendous revolution was to come that would leave in Europe nothing now existing; an anarchistic republic which he did not take the trouble to explain, and as to which he was only clear in his exterminating negations. The bull-fighters talked to him as to a father. He spoke as a familiar to all of them, and no more was needed than to get a telegram from a distant part of the Peninsula, for the good doctor to take the train on the instant to go to treat the horn-wound received by one of his _boys_ with no other hope of recompense than whatever they might freely wish to give him.  On seeing Gallardo after a long absence he embraced him, pressing his flabby abdomen against the other's body which seemed made of bronze."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33799"],["title","The Blood of the Arena (#3)"],["body","avo! He thought the _espada_ looking better than ever.  \"And how is the Republic getting on, doctor? When is it going to happen?\" asked Gallardo with an Andalusian drawl. \"Nacional says it's going to come off soon; that it will be here one of these days.\"  \"And what does that matter to thee, rogue? Let poor Nacional alone. The best thing for him to do is to stick in his _banderillas_ better. As for thee, the only thing that should interest thee is to keep on killing bulls, like the very God himself. A fine afternoon this is going to be. They tell me that the bulls--\"  But here the young man who had seen the sorting of the animals and wished to talk about it, interrupted the doctor to tell of a dark bull that had caught his eye, and from which he expected the greatest prowess. The two men, who had remained silent after bowing to one another, were face to face, and Gallardo thought an introduction necessary. But what was the name of that friend whom he addressed as _thou_? He scratched his head, knitting his eyebrows with an effort at recollection, but his indecision was short.  \"Listen! What is thy name? Pardon, thou seest--with meeting so many people--\"  The young man concealed beneath a smile of approbation his disenchantment at seeing himself forgotten by the master, and gave his name. Gallardo on hearing it felt the past come back suddenly to his memory, and made reparation for his forgetfulness by adding after the name, \"wealthy miner from Bilbao.\" Then he presented the \"famous Doctor Ruiz\" and both men, as if they had known one another all their lives, united by the enthusiasm of a common devotion, began to gossip about the bulls of the afternoon.  \"Sit down.\" Gallardo motioned to a sofa at the end of the room. \"You'll not be in the way there. Talk and don't notice me. I am going to dress. I think that, as we're all men--\"  And he took off his clothes, remaining in his under-garments.  Seated on a chair in the centre of the archway that divided the little reception room from the sleeping alcove, he gave himself up to the hands of Garabato, who had opened a bag of Russia-leather and was taking out of it an almost feminine _necessaire_ for the swordsman's toilet.  In spite of the fact that the latter was carefully shaved he lathered his face again and passed the razor over his cheeks with the skill of one daily accustomed to the task. After washing himself Gallardo returned to his seat. The servant deluged his hair with brilliantine and other perfumes, combing it in curls over his forehead and temples; then he undertook the arrangement of the professional emblem, the sacred _coleta_.  With a certain respect he combed the long lock that crowned the occiput of the _maestro_, braided it and, postponing the completion of the operation, fixed it on the top of his head with two hairpins, leaving its final arrangement until later. Now he must occupy himself with the feet, and he stripped the athlete of his socks, leaving him dressed only in an undershirt and drawers of silk mesh.  Gallardo's strong muscles were outlined beneath this clothing in vigorous protuberances. A hollow in one thigh showed a deep scar where the flesh had disappeared on account of a horn-stab. Signs of old wounds were marked by white spots on the brown skin of his arms. His breast, dark and free from hair, was crossed by two irregular purplish lines, with a round depression, as if it had served as a mould for a coin. But his gladiatorial person exhaled an odor of clean brave flesh, mingled with strong but effeminate perfumes.  Garabato, with an armful of cotton and white bandages, knelt at the swordsman's feet.  \"Like the ancient gladiators,\" said Dr. Ruiz, interrupting his conversation with the man from Bilbao; \"thou hast become a Roman, Juan.\"  \"Age, doctor,\" answered Gallardo with a certain melancholy. \"We all have to grow old. When I used to fight bulls and hunger too, I didn't need this--and I had feet of iron in doing the cape-work.\"  Garabato introduced little tufts of cotton between his master's toes; then he covered the soles and upper part with a layer of this soft material and, putting on the bandages, began to bind them in tight spirals, as the ancient mummies are enwrapped. To fasten this arrangement he took the threaded needles he wore on one sleeve and carefully sewed the ends of the bandages.  Gallardo stamped on the floor with his compressed feet, which seemed firmer inside their soft swathing. Thus encased they felt strong and agile. The servant then drew on long stockings which reached half way up his leg; they were thick and flexible like leggings--the only defence of the legs under the silk of the fighting dress.  \"Be careful about wrinkles. Look out, Garabato, I don't like to wear pockets!\"  And he stood up to look at himself in the two panels of the mirror, stooping to pass his hands over his legs and smooth out the wrinkles. Over the white stockings Garabato drew on others of rose-colored silk. Then Gallardo thrust his feet into his low shoes, choosing them from among several pairs that Garabato had put on a trunk, all with white soles and perfectly new.  Now the real task of dressing began. The servant handed him his fighting trousers held by the legs,--tobacco-colored silk with heavy embroideries of gold on their seams. Gallardo put them on and the thick cords with gold tassels that closed the knees, congesting the leg with artificial fulness, hung to his feet.  Gallardo told his servant to tighten them as much as he could, at the same time swelling up the muscles of his legs. This operation was one of the most important. A bull-fighter must wear the _machos_ well tightened. And Garabato, with deft speed, converted the dangling cords into little bows.  The master put on the fine batiste shirt which the servant offered him, with gatherings on the bosom, soft and transparent as a feminine garment. Garabato after buttoning it tied the knot of the long cravat that fell in a red line, dividing the bosom until it was lost in the waistband of the trousers.  The most complicated part of the dressing still remained, the _faja_, a band of silk nearly five yards long, that seemed to fill the whole apartment, Garabato managing it with the skill of long practice.  The swordsman walked to the other extreme of the room where his friends were and put one of the ends around his waist.  \"Come, be very careful!\" he said to his servant. \"Make the most of thy little skill.\"  Slowly turning on his heels he drew near his servant who held one end of the belt, thus winding it around his body in regular curves, giving greater elegance to his waist. Garabato, with rapid movements of his hands, changed the folds of the band of silk. With some turns the belt rolled double, with others wide open, and it all adjusted itself to the bull-fighter's form, smooth as if it were a single piece, without wrinkles or puffs. Gallardo, scrupulous and fastidious in the arrangement of his person, stopped his progress in the course of the rotatory journey to go back two or three times and improve upon the work.  \"It isn't good,\" he said with ill-humor. \"Damn it all! Be careful Garabato.\"  After many halts Gallardo reached the end with the entire piece of silk wound around his waist. The skilful servant had sewed and put pins and safety pins all over his master's body, converting his clothes into one single piece. To get out of them the bull-fighter would have to resort to scissors and to others' hands. He could not divest himself of a single garment until his return to the hotel, unless the bull should accomplish it for him in the open plaza and they should finish undressing him in the hospital.  Gallardo seated himself again and Garabato went about the business of arranging the queue, taking out the hairpins and adding the _moña_, the black rosette with streamers which recalled the ancient head-dress of early bull-fighting times.  The master, as if he wished to put off the moment of final encasement in the costume, stretched himself, asked Garabato for the cigar that he had left on the little night-table, and demanded the time, thinking that all the clocks were fast.  \"It's early yet. The boys haven't come. I don't like to go to the plaza early. It makes a fellow tired to be there waiting!\"  A servant of the hotel announced that the carriage with the _cuadrilla_ had arrived.  It was time to go. There was no excuse for delaying the moment of setting forth. He put over his belt the gold-embroidered vest and outside of this the jacket, a shining garment with enormous embossments, heavy as armor and resplendent with light as a glowing coal. The silk, color of tobacco, was only visible on the under side of the arms and in two triangles on the back. Almost the entire garment disappeared under the heavy layer of trimmings and gold-embroidered designs forming flowers with colored stones in their corollas. The shoulder pieces were heavy masses of gold embroidery from which fell a fringe of the same metal. The garment was edged with a close fringe that moved at every step. From the golden opening of the pockets the points of two handkerchiefs peeped forth, red like the cravat and the tie.  The cap!  Garabato took out of an oval box with great care the fighting cap, black and shining, with two pendent tassels, like ears of passementerie. Gallardo put it on, taking care that the _coleta_ should remain unhidden, hanging symmetrically down his back.  The cape!  Garabato caught up the cape from off a chair, the _capa de gala_, a princely mantle of silk of the same shade as the dress and equally burdened with gold embroidery. Gallardo hung it over one shoulder and looked at himself in the glass, satisfied with his preparations. It was not bad.  \"To the plaza!\"  His two friends took their farewells hastily and called a cab to follow him. Garabato put under one arm a great bundle of red cloths, from the ends of which peeped the hilts and guards of many swords.     CHAPTER II  "]]]
