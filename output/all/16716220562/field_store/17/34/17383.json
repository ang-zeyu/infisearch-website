Hist., 16:259, August 18, type from Caparo,         Trinidad.  In listing the subspecific names given immediately above we are aware of the possibility that a thorough study of the geographic variation in _Didelphis marsupialis_ may contract or expand the list of recognizable subspecies. We are aware also that Hershkovitz (Fieldiana: Zoology, 31 (No. 47):548, July 10, 1951) has arranged several of the subspecific names listed immediately above as synonyms of _Didelphis marsupialis californica_ Bennett. We have not employed his arrangement because he has not given proof that the currently recognized subspecies are indistinguishable.   ~Caluromys derbianus canus~ (Matschie)  Matschie (Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft Naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin, Jahrgang 1917, p. 284 (for April), September, 1917) applied the name _Micoureus canus_ to a specimen on which the locality was no more precise than Nicaragua. Comparison of Matschie's description with specimens in the United States National Museum (including the holotype of _Philander centralis_ Hollister and referred specimens of _Philander laniger pallidus_ Thomas) reveals that Matschie's specimen was intermediate in coloration between the other two kinds of woolly opossums named above and that there is nothing distinctive, in the specific sense, in the cranial measurements which Matschie published (_op. cit._). _M. canus_, therefore, may be merely an intergrade between the two previously named woolly opossums (_C. d. centralis_ and _C. d. pallidus_), an individual variant of a previously named kind, say, _C. d. pallidus_, or a valid subspecies. If it is a recognizable subspecies, it probably comes from somewhere in the eastern half of Nicaragua. As a means of handling the name, _Micoureus canus_ Matschie, we tentatively place it as a subspecies of the species _Caluromys derbianus_. The name may, therefore, stand as _Caluromys derbianus canus_ (Matschie), with type locality in Guatemala.   ~Caluromys derbianus fervidus~ (Thomas)  Elliott (Field Columb. Mus. Nat. Hist., Publ. No. 115, Zool. Ser., 8:5, 1907) lists as _Caluromys laniger pallidus_ a specimen from Honduras that was acquired for the Field Columbian Museum (= Chicago Natural History Museum) by purchase from Ward's Natural Science Establishment of Rochester, New York. On August 4, 1951, in the Chicago Natural History Museum, we found in the catalogue of the collection of Recent mammals an entry for a male _Caluromys_ bearing catalogue number 6 and listed as from \"San Pedro Sula [Honduras]. From Wards. Mounted\". In the collection of study specimens there is no specimen from Honduras that was purchased from Ward's, mounted or unmounted. In the sealed, glass-fronted, exhibit cases of mammals on display there is one, and only one, _Caluromys_. It is presumed to be specimen No. 6. This specimen is not _C. d. pallidus_ because it is too dark. It could be _Caluromys derbianus fervidus_ and we tentatively refer it to that subspecies.   ~Caluromys derbianus pallidus~ (Thomas)  From Puntarenas, Costa Rica, Harris (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool. Univ. Michigan, 476:7, October 8, 1943) listed as _Caluromys laniger centralis_ a female, skull and skin, No. 62702 in the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan. We have examined this specimen, the color of which is darker than in some other specimens of _C. d. pallidus_ but lighter than that of specimens of _C. d. centralis_ (for example, specimens from Turrialba, Costa Rica) and on basis of color we refer No. 62702 to _Caluromys derbianus pallidus_.   ~Scalopus aquaticus aereus~ (Bangs)  Bangs' (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 10:138, December 28, 1896) name _S. a. aereus_ was based on a single specimen that shows more than an average amount of coppery color. Jackson (N. Amer. Fauna, 38:52, September 30, 1915) and subsequent authors accord full specific rank to the specimen under the name _Scalopus aereus_. Blair (Amer. Midland Nat., 22:98, July, 1939) recorded, from the type locality of _Scalopus aereus_, normally colored individuals of _Scalopus aquaticus pulcher_ Jackson. Previously, Scheffer (Kansas State Agric. College, Exp. Bull., 168:4, August 1, 1910) reported that in his examination of 100 individuals of _Scalops_ [= _Scalopus_] _aquaticus_ from Manhattan, Kansas, there were two individuals \"that were suffused all over with rich golden brown.\" Because our examination of the type specimen of _Scalops texanus aereus_ Bangs reveals no features additional to coppery color that differentiate _aereus_ from other individuals of _Scalopus aquaticus pulcher_ Jackson (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 27:19, February 2, 1914) we conclude that Jackson's name and Bangs' name (_Scalops texanus aereus_) apply to the same subspecies. Bangs' name has priority and the correct name, therefore, for the populations of moles that in recent years have been designated as _Scalopus aereus_ Bangs and _Scalopus aquaticus pulcher_ Jackson will be _Scalopus aquaticus aereus_ (Bangs). This name combination was previously used by Miller (U.S. Nat. Mus. Bull., 79:8, December 31, 1912).   ~Scalopus aquaticus australis~ (Chapman)  Quay (Jour. Mamm., 30:66, February 14, 1949) recorded _Scalopus aquaticus_ from Springhill Plantation, 10 miles south-southwest of Thomasville, Georgia. He stated that the specimens were intermediate between the subspecies _S. a. australis_ and _S. a. howelli_, but did not refer the specimens to either subspecies. The locality whence the material was obtained is approximately half way between the geographic ranges, as previously known, of _S. a. australis_ and _S. a. howelli_ (see Jackson, N. Amer. Fauna, 38, September 30, 1915).  The specimens recorded by Quay probably are two females in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History bearing Catalogue Nos. 18136 and 18262 and labeled as from Springhill Plantation, Thomas County, Georgia. We have examined these specimens and find that they resemble _S. a. howelli_ in narrowness across the upper tooth-rows, but that they resemble _S. a. australis_ in length of tail (22, 24), in shortness of maxillary tooth-row (9.5, 9.5), and in convex dorsal outline of the skull. Accordingly, we refer the specimens to _Scalopus aquaticus australis_.   ~Sorex cinereus cinereus~ Kerr  In his revision of the American long-tailed shrews, Jackson (N. Amer. Fauna, 51, vi + 238, 13 pls., 24 figs., July 24, 1928) referred specimens of _Sorex cinereus_ from Tyonek, Cook Inlet, Alaska, to the subspecies _S. c. cinereus_ (_op. cit._: 46) and one specimen from Chester Creek, Anchorage, Alaska, to the subspecies _S. c. hollisteri_ (_op. cit._: 56). Thus, the geographic ranges of the two subspecies would seem to overlap around the northern shores of Cook Inlet. In an attempt to resolve this seemingly anomalous distribution, we have examined pertinent materials in the Biological Surveys Collection, U.S. National Museum. We agree with Jackson (_op. cit._) that the series of specimens from Tyonek is readily referable to _S. c. cinereus_. To our eye, however, the specimen, No. 232691, from Anchorage is referable to _Sorex cinereus cinereus_, rather than to _S. c. hollisteri_. The reference is made on the basis of the darker color, especially of the underparts. In this specimen, other characters that distinguish the two mentioned subspecies are not apparent, probably because it is relatively young; the teeth show only slight wear.   ~Sorex trowbridgii humboldtensis~ Jackson  In his account of the long-tailed shrews, Jackson (N. Amer. Fauna, 51:98, July 24, 1928) listed under specimens examined of _Sorex trowbridgii montereyensis_ four specimens from 7 mi. N Hardy, Mendocino Co., California. Under his account of the subspecies _S. t. humboldtensis_, however, he (_op. cit._:97) mentions that specimens (seemingly the same four) from 7 mi. N Hardy \"have shorter tails than typical representatives of _humboldtensis_, but in color and cranial characters they are similar to this [_humboltensis_] subspecies.\" We conclude, therefore, that the specimens mentioned were inadvertently listed as _S. t. montereyensis_ and are _Sorex trowbridgii humboldtensis_. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the locality concerned, 7 mi. N Hardy, is within the geographic range assigned to _S. t. humboldtensis_ by Jackson (_op. cit._:97); his southern records of occurrence of _S. t. humboldtensis_ are Sherwood and Mendocino, both in Mendocino County, California. Our conclusion is further supported by Grinnell's (Univ. California Publ. Zool., 40(2):80, September 26, 1933) statement of the range of _S. t. montereyensis_ as \"from southern Mendocino County south....\"   ~Blarina brevicauda churchi~ Bole and Moulthrop  Kellogg (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., 86:253, February 14, 1939) tentatively referred specimens of the short-tailed shrew from the mountainous parts of eastern Tennessee to the subspecies _Blarina brevicauda talpoides_, with the remark that they were unlike specimens of that subspecies obtained in eastern and southern West Virginia. Subsequently, Bole and Moulthrop (Sci. Publ. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:109, September 11, 1942) named the subspecies _Blarina brevicauda churchi_ with type locality at Roan Mountain, North Carolina. We have examined the specimens in the U.S. National Museum recorded by Kellogg (_loc. cit._) from the following localities: Shady Valley, 2900 ft. (Catalogue No. 267182); Holston Mtn., 4 mi. NE Shady Valley, 3800 ft. (Nos. 267176-267178, 267180, and 267181); Holston Mtn., 3 mi. NE Shady Valley, 3000 ft. (No. 267179); Roan Mtn., (Nos. 267469-267475); Mt. Guyot, 6300 ft. (No. 267183); 4-1/2 mi. SE Cosby, 3300 and 3400 ft. (Nos. 267184 and 267185); and Snake Den Mtn., 3800 ft. (No. 267186). Among named kinds of _Blarina brevicauda_, we find these specimens to resemble most closely _Blarina brevicauda churchi_ and so refer them. They are readily distinguishable from specimens of _B. b. kirtlandi_, that occurs farther"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33710"],["title","Comments on the Taxonomy and Geographic Distribution of Some North American (#2)"],["body","in the same mountain range, by larger size and longer tail. Incidentally, in the specimens that we have examined, we do not find that _B. b. churchi_ is darker colored than other subspecies of _Blarina brevicauda_; _B. b. churchi_, to us, is indistinguishable in color from _B. b. kirtlandi_. Bole and Moulthrop (_op. cit._) thought that _B. b. churchi_ was notably darker than other subspecies from adjoining areas.   ~Blarina brevicauda carolinensis~ (Bachman)  Blair (Amer. Midland Nat., 22(1):99, July, 1939) referred specimens of the short-tailed shrew from the Arbuckle Mountain area of Oklahoma to _Blarina brevicauda hulophaga_ and specimens from Mohawk Park, Tulsa County, Oklahoma, to _B. b. carolinensis_. Later Bole and Moulthrop (Sci. Publs. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:108, September 11, 1942) saw two of the specimens from Mohawk Park and assigned them to _B. b. hulophaga_. According to the most recent published account, therefore, _B. b. hulophaga_ would seem to have a peculiarly discontinuous geographic range. We have examined the material seen by Blair and by Bole and Moulthrop (Nos. 75946, 75947, 75643, Mus. Zool. Univ. Michigan) in an attempt to form our own judgment as to their subspecific identity. The teeth of No. 75946 are well worn, whereas the teeth of the other two are scarcely worn. We are unable to distinguish No. 75946 from topotypes of _B. b. carolinensis_ by size, color, or cranial features. The two younger specimens are smaller and paler, but do not agree with the description of _B. b. hulophaga_. The nearly-complete narrow, white girdle of No. 75947 is clearly an individual variation. We assign the animals to _Blarina brevicauda carolinensis_ (Bachman) as did Blair (_loc. cit._).   ~Blarina brevicauda minima~ Lowery  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 25:207, October 24, 1905) identified as _Blarina brevicauda carolinensis_ one specimen from Joaquin and two specimens from Big Thicket, 8 mi. NE Sour Lake, both localities in eastern Texas. Strecker and Williams (Jour. Mamm., 10:259, August 10, 1929) later recorded the specimens again under the same name. The subsequent naming of _B. b. plumbea_ from Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Aransas County, Texas (Davis, Jour. Mamm., 22(3):317, August 14, 1941) and _B. b. minima_ from Louisiana (Lowery, Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana St. Univ., 13:218, November 22, 1943) leaves the identity of the specimens from eastern Texas in doubt. We have examined the following specimens in the Biological Surveys Collection, U.S. National Museum: No. 117372, from Joaquin; No. 136407, from 7 mi. NE Sour Lake; and No. 136788, from 8 mi. NE Sour Lake. We judge these to be the specimens referred to by Bailey (_loc. cit._). We find that they are indistinguishable from specimens of _Blarina brevicauda minima_ and they seem to differ from _B. b. plumbea_ in being chestnut rather than plumbeous in color and in lacking the highly-arched posterior border of the palate. They are easily distinguished from _B. b. carolinensis_ by their chestnut, rather than slaty-black, color and small size. They are distinguishable from _B. b. hulophaga_, to which they might conceivably be referred on geographic grounds, by their color and small size. We refer them to _Blarina brevicauda minima_ Lowery.   ~Spilogale angustifrons angustifrons~ A. H. Howell  In his \"Revision of the skunks of the genus Spilogale\" (N. Amer. Fauna, 26, November 24, 1906) A. H. Howell identified certain specimens in the United States National Museum as follows:      _Spilogale leucoparia_, [Male] sad. 55585 from Tulancingo, Hidalgo     (_op. cit._:21).      _Spilogale gracilis_, [Male] sad. 88154 from San Sebastian in     Jalisco, [Male] ad. 79017 from Lagos in Jalisco, [Male] ad. 47177     from Pátzcuaro in Michoacán (_op. cit._:23).      _Spilogale ambigua_, [Male] ad. 35667/20437 from Barranca Ibarra in     Jalisco, [Male] yg. 120101 from Ocotlán in Jalisco (_op. cit._:25).  Hall and Villa (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist, 1:448, December 27, 1949) inferred that No. 47177 from Pátzcuaro was instead referable to _Spilogale angustifrons angustifrons_. Our examination of No. 47177 and of each of the other specimens mentioned by catalogue number immediately above leads us to conclude that they all are of one species, and that, among named kinds of _Spilogale_, they should be referred to the subspecies _Spilogale angustifrons angustifrons_ Howell.  Our examination of all of the specimens that Howell (_op. cit_.) identified as _Spilogale [angustifrons] angustifrons_ reveals that none of the specimens from the type locality had attained full adult stature; the holotype is a subadult and the other specimens from the type locality are even younger. The small size of these specimens from the type locality seems to have misled Howell into thinking that they were taxonomically distinct from the larger specimens--those from Jalisco, Michoacán and Hidalgo--that he identified as other kinds.   ~Spilogale gracilis gracilis~ Merriam  In the genus _Spilogale_ four specific names, concerning the status of which we have been uncertain, are listed below in the order of their appearance in the literature.      1890. _Spilogale gracilis_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 3:83,     September 11, type from bottom of canyon, Grand Canyon, Arizona.      1890. _Spilogale leucoparia_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 4:11,     October 8, type from Mason, Mason County, Texas.      1891. _Spilogale phenax arizonae_ Mearns, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.     Hist., 3:256, June 5, type from near Fort Verde, Yavapai County,     Arizona.      1897. _Spilogale ambigua_ Mearns, Preliminary diagnoses of new     mammals ... from the Mexican boundary line, p. 3, January 12     [reprinted in Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., 20:460, December 24, 1897],     type from summit of Eagle Cliff Mtn., 2 mi. S of Monument No. 5 of     Emory's Survey which, according to Miller (U.S. Nat. Mus. Bull.,     128:134, April 29, 1924), is \"Eagle Mountain, Chihuahua, Mexico,     about four miles south of Dona Ana County, New Mexico.\"  In 1906 (N. Amer. Fauna, 26:1-55, 10 pls., November 24) A. H. Howell's \"Revision of the skunks of the genus Spilogale\" was published and the four names listed above were retained by him as applying to four species (not subspecies). His map (_op. cit._, pl. 1) showing the geographic distribution of the four kinds looks reasonable enough at first inspection and does not indicate any overlapping of the geographic ranges of the species in question, but if a map be made by plotting the localities of occurrence recorded by Howell (_op. cit._), for specimens examined by him, a notably different geographic distribution is shown. For one thing the geographic ranges of _gracilis_, _leucoparia_, _arizonae_ and _ambigua_ coincide over a considerable part of Arizona. Also, specimens collected in recent years from Arizona and adjoining areas do not readily fit into the \"species\" recognized by Howell; some specimens are structurally intermediate between two or more of these species and other specimens combine the diagnostic characters ascribed to two or more of the alleged species. For these and other reasons a re-appraisal of the application of the names mentioned above long has been indicated.  Before re-appraising the names it is pertinent to recall that Howell's paper in 1906 on _Spilogale_ was only the second revisionary paper that he prepared. It was prepared by a man who at that time lacked much taxonomic experience, and who held to a morphotype concept. Howell worked under the guidance, in the literal sense, of Dr. C. Hart Merriam. The concept of species and subspecies held by Merriam fortunately was recorded by him (Jour. Mamm., 1:6-9, November 28, 1919). Merriam's reliance on degree of difference and his disregard of intergradation were naturally (and necessarily, we think, in Howell's work in 1906) adopted by Howell. For example, of six specimens from Point Reyes in west-central California, a place less than ten miles from the type locality of _Spilogale phenax phenax_, Howell (_op. cit._:33) assigned one specimen to the subspecies _Spilogale phenax latifrons_! _S. p. latifrons_ occurs in Oregon and in northern California--no nearer than 200 miles to Point Reyes. Howell's assignment of this specimen to _S. p. latifrons_ was not a _lapsus_, as persons with the modern (geographic) concept of a subspecies would be likely to suppose. Howell's assignment of the one specimen to _S. p. latifrons_ and the other five specimens to _S. p. phenax_ was intentional, as he told one of us (Hall). He explained that he relied upon the morphological characters of the individual animal instead of upon the morphological characters of a population of animals. To him, therefore, there was nothing inconsistent in his procedure in 1906. Also, variation that was the result of difference in age and variation that was the result of individual deviation were not understood, or at least not taken into account, by Howell in 1906, nor by Merriam in 1890. For example, Merriam selected the most extensively white specimen available to him for the holotype of _Spilogale leucoparia_. He, and Howell in 1906, used the extensiveness of the white areas of that particular specimen (see fig. 3, pl. 2, N. Amer. Fauna, 26, 1906) as a character diagnostic of the \"species\" _S. leucoparia_ although each of the authors had available two other specimens of _S. leucoparia_ from the type locality, and all of the other referred specimens in the United States National Museum, that were less extensively white than the holotype. The _individual specimen_ was the primary basis for the species or subspecies and one selected specimen alone often was used in making comparisons between a given named kind and some other species or subspecies. Also, be it remembered, degree of difference, and not presence or absence of intergradation, was the basis on which subspecific _versus_ specific rank was accorded to a named kind of animal."]]]
