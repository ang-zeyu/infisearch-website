INDICATORS IN THE FRONTISPIECE  There are 12 windows in the frontispiece, through each of which appears an indication relating to time. Beginning at the top of the frontispiece of the dial, the first opening occurs on the breast of the imperial eagle. This indicates the dominating planet, represented by its symbol, and its house.  The opening in the eagle's left claw, labeled \"Lit. Dom.\" is the dominical letter. The first seven days in the month of January are each assigned one of the letters _a_ through _g_ in order of appearance. The letter which coincides with the first Sunday within this period is called the dominical letter, and it serves for the following year. In leap year, two letters are required, one to February 29th and the letter next proceeding for the remainder of the year. This letter is used in connection with establishing the date of Easter Sunday. The date of Easter regulates the dates of the other movable feasts.  The eagle's right claw is labeled \"Cyc. EpEC\" and represents the epact, or the age of the moon on January 1st. It serves to find the moon's age by indicating the number of days to be added to each lunar year in order to complete a solar year. Twelve lunar months are nearly 11 days short of the solar year, so that the new moons in one year fall 11 days earlier than they did the preceding year. However, 30 days are deducted as an intercalary month since the moon has made a revolution in that time, and the remainder, 3, would be the epact.  Below the imperial eagle two winged cherubs support a riband with three indictions of the Julian period. This period of 7980 years is the product derived from multiplying together the sums of 28, which represents the cycle of the sun; 19, representing the cycle of the moon; and 15, which represents the Roman indiction. The Julian period is reckoned to have begun from 4713 B.C. so that the period will be completed in A.D. 3267. The first of the three openings is marked \"Ind. Rom.\" or \"Roman indiction,\" which was an edict by the Emperor Constantine in A.D. 312, providing for the assessment of a property tax at the beginning of each 15-year cycle. It continues to be used in ecclesiastical contracts. The second opening, which occurs immediately below the eagle, is marked \"Cyc. Sol.\" (cycle of the sun). This cycle takes a period of 28 years, after which the days of the week once again fall upon the same days of the month as they did during the first year of the former cycle. There is no relationship with the course of the sun itself, but was invented for the purpose of determining the dominical letter which designates the days of the month on which the Sundays occur during each year of the cycle. Since cycles of the sun date from 9 years before the Christian era, it is necessary to add the digit 9 to the digits of the current year and then divide the result by 28. The quotient is the number of cycles which has passed, and the remainder will be the year of the cycle answering to the current year. The third opening on the riband is labeled \"Num. Aur.\" (golden number). Meton, an astronomer of Athens, discovered in 432 B.C. that after a period of 19 years the new and the full moons returned on the same days of the month as they had before, and this is called the cycle of the moon. The Greeks were so impressed with this calculation that they had it inscribed in letters of gold upon stone, hence the golden number. The First Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 determined that Meton's cycle was to be used to regulate the movable feasts of the Church.  Immediately above the chapter rings is an opening through which the orb of the sun is visible.   THE CHAPTER-RING ASSEMBLY  In a separate chapter in his second volume, entitled \"Descriptio Authomatis Summa totius Operis Mechanici\" (Description of the Automaton--Summary of the Complete Mechanism), Father Borghesi provided a description of the functions of the various indicators, prefixing it with the short poem shown in figure 18. He then continues:       In the middle of the frontispiece, as at the center of the      universe, the terraqueous globe of the week revolves, with a      daily motion turning from right to left, bringing with it from      the round window the coming day and at the circumference the      circle of hours common to the sun, to the moon, to the fixed      stars, to the head and tail of the dragon, and to the raging      sea.       The second circle revolves the synodic-periodic measure of the      raging sea, the days of the median lunar-synodic age, the signs      and individual degrees of the signs of the distance of the moon      from the middle of the sun within the time of 29 terrestrial      revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13. This circle revolves likewise      from right to left around the center of the earth. In this      second circle, another little orb revolves, bringing with it      the epicycle of the moon, in which the little circle of the      moon (whose illuminated middle always faces towards the sun),      running from left to right through the signs of the anomaly;      within 13 revolutions of the earth, hours 18.39.16. It descends      from apogee to perigee and in just as many others it returns      from perigee to apogee, to be carried down thus to true, back      and front from the longitude and distance from the sun and from      the middle of the earth.       The third circle (on which I have tried to indicate      astronomically-geometrically in their places, the degrees of      lunar latitude both in the south and in the north, and some      fixed stars, those, namely, which can be separated by us from      the moon which goes between) from left to right turns around      the center of the earth, stretching out the head and tail of      the dragon, on the inside above the second circle for noting      and measuring the sun (but I should rather say the earth), and      the eclipses of the moon, within 346 revolutions of the earth,      hours 14.52.23.       The fourth circle, in which the heaven of the fixed stars,      reduced to the correct ascent of our times, the signs of the      zodiac and the individual degrees of the signs, the months of      the year and the single days of the month can be seen, likewise      makes its journey around the earth from left to right in 365      terrestrial revolutions, hours 5.48.56.; that is, within a      median astronomical year. Above this annual orb, the sun, in      its small epicycle, gliding through the 12 signs of the      anomaly, within the space of 182 terrestrial revolutions, hours      15.6.58., from left to right, falls from apogee to perigee;      and, within the same time, rises from perigee to apogee, and      brings with it, the index, namely its central radius, inhering      to the axis of the equatorial orb and cutting the four greatest      circles from the center.       When the sun has been moved around, Iris shows from six windows      the era, that is, the current year. Two winged youths take      their place next to Iris, carrying the Julian period: namely,      the Roman indiction, the cycle of the sun and the golden      number, on a leaf of paper held between them. The imperial      eagle stands out on top (as if added to the frontispiece)      carrying on its breast the dominating planet and in its talons      the ecclesiastical calends (that is, the dominical letter and      the epact).   ATTACHMENTS FOR ADJUSTMENT  Two attachments, in the form of small superimposed dials are situated at the base of the dial plate, at either side and immediately below the fourth chapter ring. In his second volume, Father Borghesi stated that they \"are not moved from inside the clock, but the one at the right [inscribed _concitat_ and _retardat_] serves for loosening [accelerating] and tightening [retarding] time; that is, the reins of the perpendicular.\"  In other words, the purpose of this attachment is for adjusting the pendulum to make the clock operate fast or slow. The second attachment, which appears at the left, and which is inscribed \"Claudit\" (close) and \"Aperit\" (open) serves the purpose of \"... preparing the mechanism in a moment, as swiftly as you wish, for sustaining the astronomical experiments of which you will hear later; when these things have been done, it restores the mechanism to its natural motion at the same speed.\"  This adjustment relates to the final section of Father Borghesi's second book, entitled \"Chronologo-Astronomicus Usus Authomatis\" (Chronological-Astronomical Use of the Automaton), which is translated from the Latin in its entirety:       With one glance at this automaton, you can quickly answer these      questions: What hour the sun shows, the moon, any fixed star,      the head and tail of the dragon. Is the sea swelling with      periodic heat [at high tide?] or is it deflated [low tide], or      quiescent? How many days is it from mean new moon or full moon?      By how many signs and degrees is the moon distant from the sun,      and from its nodes? What sign of the zodiac does the sun      occupy, the moon, the head and tail of the dragon? Is the sun      or the moon, in apogee or perigee, ascending or descending?      What is the apparent speed of the sun and of the moon? What is      the apparent magnitude of the solar and lunar diameter, and of      the horizontal parallax of the umbra and penumbra of the earth?      What is the latitude of the moon? Is it north or south? Does      the moon hide [occult eclipse] any of the fixed stars from the      earth dwellers, and which of these does it obscure? Is there a      true new or full moon? Is the sun in eclipse anywhere on earth?      What is the magnitude, and the duration of this eclipse, with      respect to the whole earth? Can "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33198"],["title","The Borghesi Astronomical Clock in the Museum of History and Technology (#6)"],["body","be seen in the north or in      the south? Is the moon in eclipse? Total or partial? Of what      magnitude, etc.? What limb of the moon is obscured? How many      years have passed from a given epoch? Is this year a leap year,      or a common year--first, second, or third after leap year? What      is the current month of the year, and what day of the month and      of the week? Which of the planets is dominant? What days of the      year do the various feasts fall on, and the movable feasts      during the ecclesiastical year? And many other similar      questions, which I pass over here for the sake of brevity.       Besides, this device can be so arranged for any time      whatsoever, past or future, and for the longitude of any      region, and can be so manipulated by hand, that within the      space of a very short time there can be provided in their      proper order, the various orbits of the luminous bodies, their      alternating eclipses, as many as have taken place through the      course of many years, or even from the beginning of the world;      or those that will be seen as long as the world itself shall      last, with all their attendant circumstances (year, month, day,      duration, magnitude, etc.). All these can be seen with great      satisfaction of curiosity and of learning, and hence with great      pleasure to the soul. In the meanwhile, the little bells      continually play, at their proper, respective times. So that,      all exaggeration aside, a thousand years pass, in the sight of      this clock, as one day!       I am aware of your complaints, O star-loving reader--that my      description is too meager and too succinct. Lay the blame for      this on those cares, hateful both to me and to you, more      pressing, which forbid me and deprive you of a methodical      explanation of the work.   THE CLOCK MOVEMENT  Father Borghesi specified that the entire mechanism was equal in weight to a seventh part of a _Centenarii Germanici_, a Germanic hundredweight. This is probably the Austrian centner which is equivalent to 123.4615 pounds. Therefore, the clock mechanism weighs approximately 17.6 pounds.  The clock operated for a hundred days and more at a single winding, according to Father Borghesi, and by means of a pendulum with a leaden bob weighing 60 Viennese pounds, attached at a height of 5 feet. Father Borghesi stated the weight of the pendulum to be 60 _librarum Viennensium_, but the Viennese libra does not appear among the weights of the Austrian Empire. However, using the average libra, an ancient Roman unit of weight equal to 0.7221 pound, it may be assumed that the driving weight should be approximately 45 pounds.  Father Borghesi, however, does not venture to provide any description whatsoever of the movement of his second clock in his book. He gave the following reasons:       But beyond this, I entirely omit [a description of] the further      apparatus of the very many wheels, etc., inside the clock which      carry on its functions, lest I become too verbose for some      persons. To explain more thoroughly the internal labyrinth of      the entire mechanism, from which the movement of the circles or      heavens, etc., are derived, would seem to entangle in too many      complicated perplexities.... Therefore, that I might not delay      longer, and perhaps to no purpose, I have thought it better to      leave the whole work to the proportionate calculus of the      arithmeticians and the technical skill of mechanics. If they      have any desire to construct a similar mechanism, they will      follow the aforesaid motions of the heavens, etc., not only by      one means alone but by many, more swiftly through thoughtful      study than by any amount of instruction.       For whoever is well versed in the theory of calculus and sets      to work at any given project, will discover any desired motion      by a thousand and more ways, by one or another gearing of      wheels; which an industrious mechanic will carry out in      actuality and without too much difficulty. Nor is there any      reason for anyone to be discouraged, so long as he is not      disgusted by the amount of labor for there is nothing truer      than the old saying \"The favorable gods grant everything to the      assiduous laborer.\"       Nay, further, even this little work itself can be improved on      and surpassed by new inventions. Otherwise that other old      adage, almost as old as the world, would prove false, \"What you      have found already done, you can easily repeat, nor is it      difficult to add to what has already been invented.\" Relying on      this principle, I have already conceived some new things to be      added to the present little work.  [Illustration: Figure 17.--MOVEMENT OF BORGHESI CLOCK viewed from the right side, with details of chiming mechanism.]   THE BELLS  There is a discrepancy between Father Borghesi's written description in his second book of the number of bells and those which currently exist in the clock. At the present time, there are two sets of bells attached to the upper part of the movement. While Father Borghesi indicated that there were two sets of bells in the clock, he described the first set by stating that:       ... there are three bells inside the clock: The largest, when      struck by a little hammer at each mean new moon, signifies the      new moon. The smallest indicates in the same way the full moon      at the time of the mean full moon, by automatic sound. When on      the equatorial earth, the sun appears anywhere in eclipse, two      bells (the largest and the medium) sounding together      automatically, announce that eclipse at the time of the mean      new moon. (I think it is evident that eclipses of the sun occur      at new moons and eclipses of the moon at full moon.)       When the moon is eclipsed, the smallest and the medium bells,      simultaneously and automatically, announce the event to the ear      at the time of the mean full moon. Besides, at the proper time      and automatically, the largest of these bells announces the      current solar hour and the smallest bell strikes the quarter      hours.  In the clock today, the first set consists of a smaller bell fixed within a larger one. It is presumably these bells that indicate the eclipses and also strike the hours and quarter hours. A pull cord attached to the striking mechanism repeats the current hour and quarter hours at will. The second set consists of nine meshed bells struck with individual hammers operated by means of a pinned cylinder as in a music box. On the hour, the chimes play one of two melodies, which may be changed at will. While not identified, these appear to be Tyrolean folk melodies. The largest of this set of bells is dissimilar to the other chimes, and may be the third bell described by Father Borghesi to signify the new moon.   CHRONOGRAMS  One of the most curious aspects of the second clock produced by Father Borghesi and Bertolla, as well as of the second published volume, is the presence of chronograms which occur repeatedly on the clock dial and throughout the _Novissimum Theorico-Practicum Astronomicum Authoma_ from the title page to the end of the book. Interestingly enough, Father Borghesi did not utilize this device even once in his first little book.  [Illustration: Figure 18.--A CHRONOGRAM in the text of Father Borghesi's second volume, indicating the year 1764. The poem is translated as: \"In the Mount of 'An√°uni,' the inscrutable heavens are led, You learn from these all the labors of the sun and the moon. Here you are shown and hear the conjunction of the moon: And a bell brings to the ears by its sound, all eclipses.\"]  Webster defines a chronogram as an inscription, sentence, or phrase in which certain letters express a date or epoch. The method used by Father Borghesi for forming chronograms was a simple one. He used combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters in two sizes in the inscriptions on the clock dial and in his writings. At first this curious combination in the inscriptions on the dial plate was a source of considerable speculation. The extremely fine quality of the engraving and artistry was such that these combinations could only be deliberate in nature and not the accidental whims or accidents of the engraver. Accordingly, they must be chronographic in intention. Such proved to be the case.  Borghesi used the larger size of uppercase letters to form the chronogram, and each chronogram was complete within a phrase or line. He accomplished this by using for this purpose those letters of the alphabet which form the Roman numerals. The uppercase letters found within words are copied off in the order in which they appear in the inscription or phrase. These are then converted into their numerical equivalents, and totaled. Taking the uppermost inscription on the clock dial as the first example:      FranCIsCVs I sIt pLan. DoMInator aeternVs  The letters which are intended to form the chronogram are:       C  I  C  V I I  L  D    M  I V      100 1 100 5 1 1 50 500 1000 1 5  These figures added together total 1764.  The second inscription on the clock dial which forms a chronogram is      LaVs saCrosanCtae TrIaDI VnI Deo, et DeIparae       L V  C   C  I  D  I V I  D   D  I      50 5 100 100 1 500 1 5 1 500 500 1 = 1764.  The third inscription required a little more planning, because of its greater length. Accordingly, Father Borghesi divided it into nine parts, each of which is separated from the other by means of asterisks. Each of the nine parts of the inscription formed a chronogram which, in every instance, totals to the date 1764, the year in which the second clock was completed. The same procedure was followed with the inscriptions in the lower left and the lower right corners of the dial as well as with the maker's inscription within the central disk.
