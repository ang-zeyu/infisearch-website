Adult male having a snout-vent length of 43.2 mm.; tibia length, 22.1 mm., 51.1 per cent of snout-vent length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to tip of longest toe), 20.8 mm.; greatest width of head, 15.4 mm., 35.6 per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 13.9 mm., 32.1 per cent of snout-vent length; diameter of eye, 5.1 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 2.4 mm., 47.1 per cent of diameter of eye. Snout in lateral profile bluntly rounded, in dorsal profile truncate; canthus pronounced, rounded, not angular; loreal region slightly concave; lips thick, round, not flaring; nostrils slightly protuberant; internarial distance, 3.4 mm.; interorbital distance, 4.5 mm., somewhat broader than width of eyelid, 3.5 mm. A heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum and curved downward to insertion of forearm; tympanum round, its diameter slightly more than its distance from eye. Forearm not robust; row of small pustules on ventral surface of forearm; fold on wrist; prepollex moderately enlarged, covered with small, horny, nuptial spines continuous on edge of digit; row of spines on inner surface of second finger; subarticular tubercles large, round, none bifid; supernumerary tubercles rather large, round; palmar tubercles rather small, flat, elliptical; fingers long, moderately slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on third finger slightly larger than tympanum; rudimentary web between first and second and between second and third fingers; web between third and fourth fingers extending about one-fourth length of fourth finger. Heels overlap by about one-third length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to anterior edge of eye; tarsal fold strong, extending to heel; inner metatarsal tubercle large, high, and elongate; outer metatarsal tubercle absent; subarticular tubercles moderately large, round; supernumerary tubercles small, in single rows on proximal segments of digits; toes moderately short; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4, third and fifth toes about equal in length; toes about two-thirds webbed; web extending to middle of antepenultimate phalanx of fourth toe, to discs of first, second, and fifth toes, and to base of penultimate phalanx of third toe; discs rather small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening at level of lower edge of thighs; anal sheath elongate, deeply creased medially; transverse dermal fold above anus. Skin of dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs faintly areolate; skin of chin, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular, that of ventral surfaces of limbs, except thighs, areolate; thoracic fold absent. Tongue nearly round, slightly longer than wide, shallowly notched behind and barely free posteriorly. Vomerine teeth 4-4, situated on rounded vomerine ridges between rather small ovoid inner nares; vocal slits present, situated along posterior edge of each ramus.  Color (in alcohol) pale brown on dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs; flanks and anterior surfaces of thighs creamy white with dark brown reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan with creamy white spots; belly cream-color; anal stripe absent.  Color (in life) pale tan on dorsal surfaces; flanks and anterior surfaces of thighs pale creamy yellow with purplish brown reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan with yellow spots; ventral surfaces yellow; iris pale copper-color.  _Variation._--There is little variation in structure. The total number of vomerine teeth varies from 6 to 14. In some individuals the supratympanic fold covers the upper part of the tympanum, but at least the lower part of the tympanum is always visible. The extent of the webbing between the toes varies from three-fourths to two-thirds complete. Usually the web extends to some point on the antepenultimate phalanx of the fourth toe, but in some specimens the web extends to the base of the penultimate phalanx.  In the large series of specimens from Uruapan, Michoacán, the coloration of the flanks and anterior surfaces of the thighs varies from nearly uniform creamy yellow with only fine dark reticulations to bold reticulations enclosing yellow spots. Some specimens from Oaxaca and Veracruz have slightly different markings on the flanks; in these the dark pigment is in the form of irregular spots or dashes, instead of reticulations.  There is considerable variation in color in the living frogs. The dorsum varies from greenish tan and pale yellowish tan to reddish brown, and some individuals are dark chocolate brown.  _Remarks._--Shannon (1951:470) named _Hyla bistincta labeculata_ on the basis of a single male from San Lucas Camotlán, Oaxaca; he diagnosed the subspecies as differing from _Hyla bistincta bistincta_ by having \"the gray reticulation of the sides entirely broken up into elongate black blotches; tarsal fold moderately elevated.\" The condition of the tarsal fold is characteristic of the species. The dispersion of dark pigment on the flanks is variable. The type of _Hyla bistincta labeculata_ (USNM 123689) is extreme in the development of dark dashes on the flanks, but this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32653"],["title","A Review of the Frogs of the Hyla bistincta Group (#2)"],["body"," is approached in several specimes from Oaxaca and Veracruz. For example, in some specimens from Cumbres de Acultzingo, Veracruz, the mottling on the flanks is bold; in others the flanks are reticulated. The specimen from San Vicente, Oaxaca, has black dashes on the flanks (Smith and Williams, 1963:23), whereas a specimen from Cerro San Felipe, Oaxaca, has no pattern on the flanks. In general, specimens from western México have reticulate mottling on the flanks as compared with the marbling on the flanks in specimens from eastern México. On the basis of available data, the recognition of subspecies in _Hyla bistincta_ is unwarranted.  The tadpoles of this species described by Duellman (1961:47) are like those of _Hyla robertsorum_ in having 2/3 tooth-rows, peglike serrations on the beaks, and long, rounded tails. At Uruapan tadpoles were found in a rocky stream on April 24, 1956, and metamorphosing young were found there on August 2, 1956. A completely metamorphosed juvenile has a snout-vent length of 24.8 mm.  _Hyla bistincta_ is found only along streams, where individuals can be seen clinging to vines and other vegetation closely over-hanging fast-moving parts of the stream.  _Distribution._--_Hyla bistincta_ occurs at elevations from 1400 to 2600 meters in the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Jalisco southward through the Cordillera Volcánica in Michoacán, México, and Morelos, the Sierra de Coalcomán in Michoacán, and the Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and thence northward in the Sierra Madre Oriental to central Veracruz (Fig. 2).

A heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum and then to insertion of forearm; tympanum round, its diameter three-fourths its distance from eye. Forearm rather slender; a short axillary membrane; no fold on wrist; no nuptial excrescence or spines on enlarged prepollex; subarticular tubercles moderately small, round; none bifid; few supernumerary tubercles on proximal segments of digits; large, flat palmar tubercle present; fingers long and slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on third finger about equal to diameter of tympanum; rudimentary web between first and second fingers; web between third and fourth fingers extending to about one-fifth length of fourth finger (Fig. 1). Heels overlap by about one-third length of tibia when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to middle of eye; tarsal fold weak, extending from moderately large, flat, elliptical inner metatarsal tubercle to middle of tarsus; outer metatarsal tubercle minute, round, indistinct; subarticular tubercles round; single row of small, round supernumerary tubercles on proximal segments of each digit; toes moderately short and slender; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4, third and fifth about equal in length; toes about three-fourths webbed; web extending to base of terminal phalanx of fourth toe; discs small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening directed posteroventrally at middle of thighs; two transverse dermal folds above anus; short, thin anal sheath present; many small tubercles lateral and ventral to anal opening. Skin of dorsum, chin, and ventral surfaces of limbs smooth; belly moderately granular; posterior surfaces of thighs heavily granular; no thoracic fold. Tongue nearly round, shallowly notched behind, free posteriorly for about one-fourth its length; vomerine teeth, 3-4, long, situated on posteroventral edges of narrow transverse vomerine ridges between moderately large, round inner nares; no vocal slits.

[Illustration: FIG. 3. Holotype of _Hyla charadricola_     (KU 58414). × 1.5.]  _Variation._--Adult males have snout-vent lengths from 35.3 to 44.4 mm., and adult females from 43.4 to 50.9 mm. No notable variation in structure is displayed in the type series. In some individuals the dark reticulation on the dorsum is faint. Juveniles in life had dorsal colorations varying from rich brown with darker reticulations to pale green or gray with dark green reticulations. Some adults when collected were pale green with faint or no dorsal reticulations; later these individuals darkened. In all specimens the anal stripe is absent, and the flanks are heavily spotted.  _Comparisons.--Hyla charadricola_ differs from all other members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group in the following combination of characters: truncate snout, green dorsum, and absence of a thoracic fold. From other hylids that occur in the same area, _Hyla charadricola_ differs from _Hyla miotympanum_ and _H. arborescandens_, both of which are green dorsally, by having a truncate snout and longer fingers with less webbing. _Hyla eximia_, though green, has brown dorsal spots, shorter fingers, and a round snout. _Hyla robertsorum_ differs in having a round snout and brown dorsum, and _Hyla taeniopus_ is much larger, has transverse bands on the limbs, and has extensive webbing between fingers.  _Remarks._--At the type locality, a shallow rocky stream in pine forest, _Hyla charadricola_ was found beneath rocks at the edge of fast moving sections of the stream and beneath rocks in shallow riffles in the stream. Most of the frogs were in water. At night they were found sitting on rocks in the stream. _Hyla miotympanum_, which is abundant at the type locality, lives in bushes and beneath rocks along the stream but usually is not found in the riffles inhabited by _Hyla charadricola_. At Lago de Tejocotal _Hyla charadricola_ was found beneath rocks near the shore of the lake and by a stream in the pine forest. Individuals were found on low vegetation over-hanging a small stream in pine-oak forest four kilometers southwest of Tianguistengo.  Five recently metamorphosed young (KU 58424-9) found at the type locality on June 8, 1960, have snout-vent lengths of 22.4 to 24.0 (average 23.2) mm. The young are colored like the adults, except that in life the dorsum is a brighter green and the flanks are more yellow than tan and have less dark spotting than in adults.  _Distribution.--Hyla charadricola_ inhabits streams in pine and pine-oak forests at elevations of 2000 to 2300 meters in northern Puebla and eastern Hidalgo (Fig. 2).
