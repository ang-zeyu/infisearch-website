Adult male having a snout-vent length of 45.1 mm.; tibia length, 22.1 mm., 49.0 per cent of snout-vent length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to tip of longest toe), 21.5 mm.; greatest width of head, 13.7 mm., 30.4 per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 12.6 mm., 27.9 per cent of snout-vent length; diameter of eye, 4.0 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.8 mm., 45 per cent of diameter of eye. Snout short, in lateral profile blunt, in dorsal profile round; canthus rounded; loreal region slightly concave; lips thick, round, and not flaring; nostrils slightly protuberant; internarial distance, 3.6 mm.; interorbital distance, 4.0 mm., slightly broader than width of eyelid, 3.5 mm. A moderately heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum and curving downward towards insertion of forearm; tympanum nearly round, covered by dermal fold above, its diameter slightly less than its distance from eye. Forearm moderately robust; distinct fold on wrist; prepollex much enlarged with patch of small nuptial spines continuous on side of digit; similar line of nuptial spines on inner edge of second finger; subarticular tubercles round, moderate in size, none bifid; supernumerary tubercles small and present only proximally; fingers long and slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on third finger about size of tympanum; no web between first and second fingers; rudimentary web between other fingers. Legs robust; heels over-lap by about one-fourth length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extending to posterior corner of eye; tarsal fold weak, extending to about middle of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle moderately large, flat, and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle small, round, and indistinct; subarticular tubercles round; supernumerary tubercles small, in single row on proximal segments of each digit; toes moderately long and slender; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-5-3-4, the fifth nearly as long as third; toes nearly fully webbed; web extending to base of penultimate phalanx of fourth toe and to discs on other toes; discs small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening above middle of thighs; anal sheath short, deeply creased medially; heavy transverse dermal fold above anus; no large anal tubercles. Skin of all dorsal surfaces, chin, and ventral surfaces of limbs, except proximal parts of thighs, smooth; belly and proximal parts of thighs areolate; thoracic fold present, weak. Tongue elliptical, slightly longer than wide, not notched behind, and free posteriorly for about one-fourth of its length; vomerine teeth 3-3, situated on small, widely separated, transverse ridges between rather small elliptical inner nares; no vocal slits.  Color (in alcohol) dark brown with irregular darker reticulations on dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs; flanks brown with small creamy white spots; posterior surfaces of thighs dark brown; chin creamy tan; belly grayish brown with cream-colored flecks; ventral surfaces of limbs pale brown; webbing on feet gray; small white spots in anal region.  Color (in life) chocolate brown with darker brown reticulations and irregular blotches above; flanks brown with yellow spots; belly gray to grayish brown with faint cream-colored spots; iris a deep bronze color.  _Variation._--In males the total number of vomerine teeth varies from 4 to 7. In many specimens the vomerine ridges are larger and more closely approximated medially than in the specimen described above. Females attain snout-vent lengths of 51 mm., have as many as 9 vomerine teeth, and have a proportionately larger tympanum than males. Some of the largest specimens of both sexes have indistinct cream-colored pustules scattered on the ventral surface of the forearm. Some individuals have nearly uniform grayish brown ventral surfaces; in others the chin, as well as the abdomen, is brown with cream-colored spots. The dorsal surfaces of some specimens are nearly uniform dark brown with no reticulations. In others the dorsum is paler brown with distinct darker mottling; in some of these there is little mottling laterally, so that there is the effect of an irregular, pale brown, dorsolateral stripe.  _Tadpoles._--The tadpoles of this species were described by Rabb and Mosimann (1955). Tadpoles obtained from streams at 3.3 kilometers north and at 8.5 kilometers southeast of Zacualtipán, Hidalgo, are like those described by Rabb and Mosimann in having 2/3 tooth rows, peglike serrations on the beaks, and long rounded tails. The largest tadpole (KU 60078) has small hind legs, a body length of 22 mm., and a total length of 61 mm.  _Remarks._--Taylor (1940:393) found frogs of this species in plants along small spring-fed rivulets in an open meadow at El Chico Parque Nacional. Also, he noted that active frogs dove into the streams and took refuge in the mud on the bottom. Rabb and Mosimann (1955:1) found this species along banks of tiny streams in open meadows and noted that the frogs sought refuge in the water. At El Chico Parque Nacional on June 8, 1960, I found _Hyla robertsorum_ under rocks along small rivulets by day; at night, when the temperature was 14° C., frogs were sitting on rocks and in junipers overhanging a small stream. At the same locality on June 23 and 24, 1962, frogs of this species were found on rainy nights, when the temperature varied from 10 to 12° C. At this time the frogs were sitting on the grassy banks of rivulets in the meadow. During the day _Hyla robertsorum_ was found on the earthen banks of the rivulets in places where dense growths of grass overhung the streams. On December 23, 1959, one specimen of _Hyla robertsorum_ was found beneath a rock in a small stream in pine forest at 3.3 kilometers north of Zacualtipán.  Rabb and Mosimann (1955:1) obtained tadpoles of _Hyla robertsorum_ from quiet pools of a stream at El Chico Parque Nacional. I found tadpoles in pools in rocky streams in pine forest at 3.3 kilometers north and at 8.5 kilometers southeast of Zacualtipán. Four completely metamorphosed juveniles obtained on June 8, 1960, at El Chico Parque Nacional have snout-vent lengths of 30.6 to 32.0 mm. Gravid females were found at the same locality on June 8, 1960, and June 23, 1962.      [Illustration: FIG. 4.

Adult male having a snout-vent length of 39.9 mm.; tibia length, 21.0 mm., 52.6 per cent of snout-vent length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to tip of longest toe), 20.5 mm.; greatest width of head, 12.8 mm., 32.1 per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 12.3 mm., 30.8 per cent of snout-vent length. Snout short, in lateral profile bluntly rounded, in dorsal profile rounded; canthus rounded; loreal region slightly concave; lips thick, round, and not flaring; nostrils slightly protuberant; internarial distance, 2.7 mm.; interorbital distance, 3.7 mm., somewhat broader than eyelid, 2.9 mm. A heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanic region and then to insertion of forearm; tympanum completely concealed. Forearm moderately robust; distinct fold on wrist; prepollex enlarged bearing cluster of moderate-sized, horny, nuptial spines continuous on edge of digit; row of spines present on second finger; subarticular tubercles round, small proximally and slightly larger distally; supernumerary tubercles small and indistinct; three palmar tubercles, median and outer partly fused; fingers long, moderately slender; discs moderately large; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; second and fourth fingers subequal in length; webbing between fingers rudimentary. Heels overlap by about one-fourth length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to anterior edge of eye; tarsal fold thick, low, extending nearly to heel; inner metatarsal tubercle moderately large and round; outer metatarsal tubercle small and indistinct; subarticular tubercles small and round; supernumerary tubercles small, present on proximal segments of digits; toes moderately long and slender; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4; third and fifth toes subequal in length; toes about three-fourths webbed; web extending to middle of penultimate phalanx of fourth toe; discs rather small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening directed posteroventrally at level of middle of thighs; anal flap slightly elongate; thick, transverse dermal fold above anus. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of limbs, except thighs, smooth; skin of chin, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular; thoracic fold present. Tongue nearly round, slightly notched behind, and barely free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 3-3, situated on posteroventral edges of small, transverse vomerine ridges between rather large triangular inner nares; no vocal slits.  Color (in alcohol) of dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs dull grayish brown with indistinct scattered darker flecks; flanks grayish brown with cream-colored reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan; chin cream-color, mottled with brown; belly creamy yellow; anal stripe cream-color.  _Variation._--In addition to the specimen described above three others are known. One is a juvenile having a snout-vent length of 29.5 mm., and two are females having snout-vent lengths of 46.9 and 41.6 mm. Variation in structure and coloration between the four specimens is slight. In the females the tympani are partly visible and are about one-third the diameter of the eye; the chest is mottled with brown; the anal stripe extends laterally in the form of a row of cream-colored dashes and spots onto the posterodorsal surfaces of the thighs.  _Remarks._--On the basis of the four specimens available for study, _Hyla pachyderma_ seems to be closely related to _Hyla crassa_ and _Hyla robertsorum_. In the _Hyla bistincta_ group, _Hyla pachyderma_ is unique in having enlarged nuptial spines.  Taylor and Smith (1945:588) stated that the frogs were found on bushes and weeds beside a small, bounding stream near Pan de Olla. I have searched unsuccessfully for this species in the area around Pan de Olla and Tezuitlán.  _Distribution._--This species is known only from a stream at an elevation of about 1600 meters on the Atlantic slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental in central Veracruz (Fig. 4).
