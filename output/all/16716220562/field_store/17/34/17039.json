It isn't as if you were a professional anthropologist, sir--didn't you give me medical care?\"  \"Yes.... But I do anthropology, too. Medical help--ah--gains the confidence of the people....\"  \"You mean--?\" Chet was at first incredulous, then outraged. \"You mean you're not going to punish them?\"  \"That's right,\" Dr. Pine said, smiling.  \"That's wrong!\" Chet contradicted.  Cheeks burning, he turned to Commander Seymour. \"How about you, sir? Do you want your men chained to a post if they get captured? Do you want me to dismiss three years of torture as a mistake, or something? Do you want--\"  \"Here, here!\" Commander Seymour said. He didn't raise his voice. But as he rose from the cot, Chet rose with him, and found himself at attention. They eyed each other.  \"Relax,\" Dr. Pine suggested. \"Please sit down--both of you.\"  Commander Seymour obeyed his subordinate. But Chet, still standing, still angry, turned hotly on the doctor.  \"I can't just sit and let you talk about rewarding the Agvars for torturing me!\" he cried. \"We don't have to appease them--they can't fight. You don't have to be afraid--\"  \"That'll do, Barfield!\" Commander Seymour was on his feet again, and his tone was sharp. It quieted Chet instantly.  In silence he watched Commander Seymour motion Dr. Pine to follow him out the door. Someone locked it after them.         *       *       *       *       *  Alternately tossing on the cot and pacing the floor, Chet seethed for hours. His first interview with the new C.O., and two bawlings-out in five minutes! Because of Pine--Pine, who kept him confined in this room, seeing no one but the attendants, having his meals alone....  When a day passed, and then two, and he felt his strength returning, Chet was sure that Dr. Pine kept him out of the wardroom and away from the other officers only as punishment. Three years a prisoner--and a prisoner still! By the time Commander Seymour came to see him again, Chet had spent hours plotting revenge.  \"Barfield,\" the commander said, \"Dr. Pine is going--alone--to the village you escaped from. He'll pretend he's you, or someone like you--whichever he can get away with. So here's your chance for a little fresh air--you can guide us to the village.\"  \"Does that mean I go on active duty, sir?\"  \"Not quite. Dr. Pine hasn't released you from sickbay.\"  Pine again! Pine found him good enough to imitate, it seemed, but not good enough to put on duty.  Suddenly Chet saw the possibilities. So Pine was going to impersonate him? Then Pine would be taken for an escaped sacrifice, a prisoner who'd killed a witch-doctor!  Tell him? Huh. Let him find out the hard way! Then even he, yellow as he was, would want revenge on the Agvars. If he survived their welcome....  \"I'll be _glad_ to go, sir,\" Chet said.         *       *       *       *       *  They brought him fatigues, not a dress uniform. But fatigues and shoes--even tight ones--were clothing, at least. And clothing would change his appearance. The Agvars had never seen him dressed, nor, since his first days, with a haircut and shave. Whether Pine's impersonation worked or not, Chet saw no danger for himself in approaching the village. But he wondered how it was to be managed.  He was told the plan when Commander Seymour and Dr. Pine met him outside by the ship's tail. The commander, who was armed, and the doctor, already naked except for a pair of slippers and a sunlamp tan, would go with him by the shortest route direct to the village. But only Dr. Pine would enter it.  Commander Seymour explained Chet's part--and his own. \"Barfield,\" he said, \"I want you to find and point out some kind of game animal they use for food. I count on killing something after we come under the Agvars' observation. That should show off our weapon-superiority--and pave the way for a feast.\"  \"No medical stuff?\" Chet asked sarcastically. \"I thought Dr. Pine was supposed to cure all their ills, not give them indigestion.\"  \"He has to get their confidence before he can treat them,\" Commander Seymour explained seriously. \"And on a strange planet like this, he's taking quite a chance to try treatment at any time: if it fails, they're apt to accuse him of murder!\"  Chet said nothing. But he felt as if he'd drawn a wild card in a poker game.         *       *       *       *       *  They'd entered the woods. Even before that, Dr. Pine had lagged because his slippers kept falling off, and now he brought up the rear. Chet, in the lead, took a last long look at the ship before the trees and mosses cut off his view.  He went on slowed by vague reluctance. He didn't like this forest. The trees dwarfed and oppressed him. Old fears began to stir and gnaw, but at new places.  Perhaps the two men he guided would stand together against him. If so, revenge on one would cut him off from both as sharply as the forest cut him off from the ship....  Well, it was worth it! They hadn't put him on duty, hadn't accepted him as one of themselves.... He couldn't be cut off much more than he was already!  And Seymour might listen to reason. After all, he was a practical man, a leader. And Pine was yellow!  \"What's Pine after, sir?\" Chet asked over his shoulder. \"Why take these risks you've mentioned?\"  \"Well, partly for safety: if we kill any Agvars, we're likely to have to kill them all, or have the survivors to contend with indefinitely. That might cost us some casualties.... And of course there's the research angle, but that's out of my line.\"  \"What's the matter with punishment, sir--discipline? You use discipline on your crew--why not on their enemies?\"  \"Because the men understand the rules and the penalties. The Agvars don't.\"  \"Kill them, sir! That they'll understand!\"  \"No!\" Commander Seymour spoke sharply. \"If they don't fight back, that's cold-blooded slaughter. If they do, it's war. I don't hold with butchery, Barfield, and I certainly won't risk casualties just to give you a cheap feeling of satisfaction!\"  He couldn't escape. Commander Seymour, looking from over Chet's shoulder like a walking sneer, stuck close. But he gave the impression of following a man who smelled bad.  _Was he?_ Chet wondered.  Wondering, he unconsciously hung his head, slowed--stopped. Dr. Pine caught up. He and Commander Seymour, faintly breathless from the trying need to regulate their respiration consciously, looked at Chet questioningly.  Again they were sizing him up. Suddenly Chet wished he could go back to that first interview in the sickbay, and change all the things he'd said.  \"We can't go on!\" he blurted. \"You don't know what you're getting into, Doctor!\"  \"Oh?\" said Dr. Pine agreeably. \"I know more than you think, young feller.\" He smiled encouragingly.  \"That--that I've killed a witch-doctor? That you may be taken for a murderer?\"  \"Sure! You--ah--you talked about it under drugs. We ... weren't spying, Chet. We just wanted you to tell your story without reliving all the agony. It wasn't intended as--ah--a trap....\" He massaged his fingers apologetically.  \"No....\" Chet agreed. \"But-I-was-trying-to-lead-_you_-into-one!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Had he said that aloud? Chet couldn't be sure.  He listened for his own voice. The woods were quiet. His breathing seemed strangely loud. He held it--and heard the Agvars moving in the woods. Rustling, scraping, crackling--grunting their guttural dialog. Crashing! Threatening them!  \"Let's go back!\" he urged, trying to sound casual. But his trail was blocked.  \"Stick around,\" Dr. Pine suggested easily. \"You--ah--you haven't said anything we didn't know. We're going right ahead.\"  \"But why?\" Once more Chet was hotly incredulous. \"To risk your life for a few stray facts? Become a casualty while trying to _avoid_ casualties? It doesn't make sense!\"  Dr. Pine stared at his own hands as if to hide his shyness in them. \"As to the fact-seeking,\" he said slowly, \"well ... it's a matter of opinion. I've lost a few classmates.... Risks in research are commonplace--and accepted as worthwhile by most people....  \"And--ah--peace.... You once called it appeasement, but it isn't, always. Well, look. If we fought those Agvars, somebody'd have to take a patrol into their village and capture prisoners for our Intelligence, right?\"  Chet nodded dumbly.  \"Well, in a way, I--ah--am the peaceful equivalent of that patrol. The--ah--risk I run is less than if we had a war and a patrol skirmish as part of it, though. And why in the world not take for peace a risk we'd routinely accept in war?\"  Why not? But why not minimize it, just the same. The Agvars, invisible but noisy, were all around them, now. At any moment the woods might rain spears.  \"It would be safer with two of us,\" Chet said musingly. \"Your knowledge of anthropology and medicine--mine of the people--\"  \"Barfield, you're still on the sicklist,\" Commander Seymour pointed out. He watched Chet's face for a long moment before adding, \"Still--if you're over your sick-minded need for revenge--it's possible Dr. Pine may find you fit. It's up to him.\"  Chet was afraid to ask directly. He pleaded with his eyes.  Dr. Pine grinned broadly at the both. \"He's ready for duty, sir,\" he said.  Commander Seymour stepped back and scowled. \"All right, Mr. Barfield,\" he barked, \"I'll give you just three minutes to change to the uniform of the day!\"  Chet's jaw dropped. His vision, also downcast, noted the fatigues he wore, the muddy shoes. Then he looked up, saw the twinkle in his C.O.'s eyes, and understood.  In exactly three minutes he made the required change. He would enter the village as he'd left it--in the undress uniform of a Man...."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32748"],["title","Mate in Two Moves (#0)"],["body","IN TWO MOVES                             By WINSTON MARKS                          Illustrated by ASHMAN  [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction May 1954.

In fact, it took the epidemic of 1961 to break down his resistance. A great many people fell in love that year--just about every other person you talked to--so no one thought much about Dr. Murt's particular distress, except a fellow victim who was directly involved in this case.  High Dawn Hospital, where 38-year-old Dr. Murt was resident pathologist, was not the first medical institution to take note of the \"plague.\" The symptoms first came to the attention of the general practitioners, then to the little clinics where the G. P.s sent their patients. But long before anything medical was done about it, the plague was sweeping North and South America and infiltrating every continent and island in the world.  Murt's assistant, Dr. Phyllis Sutton, spotted the first irregularity in the _Times_ one morning and mentioned it to him. They were having coffee in Murt's private office-lab, after completing reports on two rush biopsies.  She looked up from the editorial page and remarked, \"You know, someone should do a research on the pathology of pantie raids.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Murt spooned sugar into his mug of coffee and stared at her. In their six months' association, it was the first facetious remark she had made in his presence. To this moment, he had held an increasing regard for her quiet efficiency, sobriety, professional dignity and decorum. True, she wore her white coat more tightly belted than was necessary and, likewise, she refused to wear the very low hospital heels that thickened feminine ankles. But she wore a minimum of come-hither in both her cosmetic and personality makeup. This startling remark, then, was most unexpected.  \"Pantie raids?\" he inquired. \"Whatever would justify an inquiry into such a patently behavioristic problem?\"  \"The epidemic nature and its increasing virulence,\" she replied soberly. \"This spring, the thing has gotten out of hand, according to this editorial. A harmless tradition at a few of the more uninhibited campuses has turned into a national collegiate phenomenon. And now secondary effects are turning up. Instructors say that intramural romance is turning the halls of ivy into amatory rendezvous.\"  Murt sipped his coffee and said, \"Be thankful you aren't a psychiatrist. Bacterial mutations are enough of a problem, without pondering unpredictable emotional disturbances.\"  His assistant pursued it further. \"It says the classrooms are emptying into the marriage bureaus, and graduation exercises this year will be a mockery if something isn't done. What's more, statistics show a startling increase in marriages at the high school level.\"  Murt shrugged broad shoulders that were slightly bent from long hours over a microscope. \"Then be thankful you aren't an overworked obstetrician,\" he offered as an amendment.  She glanced up from the paper, with annoyance showing in her dark, well-spaced eyes. \"Is it of no interest to you that several hundred thousand youngsters are leaving high school and college prematurely because they can't control their glands?\"  \"Be glad, then,\" Murt said coldly, \"that you aren't an endocrinologist--now drink your coffee. I hear the microtome working. We'll have some business in a minute.\"  Dr. Phyllis Sutton rustled the pages of the _Times_ together, folded it up and threw it at the wastebasket with more vigor than was necessary. The subject was momentarily closed.         *       *       *       *       *  His staff position at High Dawn paid less, but the life suited Dr. Murt better than the hectic, though lucrative, private practices of many of his colleagues. He arrived at the hospital early, seven o'clock each day, to be on hand for quick tissue examinations during the morning operations. By ten, the biopsies were usually out of the way, and he spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon checking material from the bacteriology section and studying post-operative dissections of tumorous tissues and organs removed in surgery.  It was engrossing, important work, and it could be accomplished in a normal work-day, leaving the pathologist considerable leisure to study, read and relax. Shortly after the pantie-raid conversation with Phyllis Sutton, he found the evening paper attracting more than his usual quick perusal.  This emotional fuss in the young human animal was beginning to preoccupy the newspaper world. Writers were raising their eyebrows and a new crop of metaphors at the statistics, which they described variously as alarming, encouraging, disheartening, provocative, distressing, romantic or revolting, depending upon the mood and point of view.  As June, the traditional mating month, wore into July, national statistics were assembled to reveal that marriages were occurring at almost double the highest previous rate, that the trend was accelerating rather than diminishing.  Jewelers and wholesale diamond merchants chalked up fabulous increases in the sale of engagement and wedding settings. Clergymen and qualified public officials were swamped with requests for religious and civil marriage ceremonies.  Parks, beaches and drive-in theaters were jammed with mooning and/or honeymooning couples, and amusement parks began expanding their over-patronized tunnel-of-love facilities.  The boom in houses, furniture, appliances and TV was on, and last year's glut of consumer goods for the home was rapidly turning into a shortage.  All was not good news, however. The divorce courts reported their calendars stacked months ahead of time, and an increasing number of lurid headlines were devoted to the love-triangular troubles of the rich, famous and notorious. Love-nest exposés and bigamous marriages rocketed in number.  The whole world, adolescent and adult, was falling in love, with the inevitable unrequited infatuations, the jealousies, infidelities and the bitter-sweetness of wholesale, illicit, impossible love situations in which vulnerable people found themselves increasing astronomically.  Writers of popular newspaper psychology columns attributed the rampaging emotional fire to everything from mass-hysteria, caused by sunspots, to the paternalism of a government that gave increased income-tax deductions to married people.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Murt's growing interest was not entirely academic. His bachelorhood was no accident of fate, but rather a carefully contrived independence, for which he paid the price of eternal vigilance. As the world supply of eligible bachelors diminished sharply, his wariness increased, and he became more and more curt with nurses and female technicians at the hospital.  He revealed the depth of his leeriness one afternoon at the scrub-up sink, where he and his assistant were washing after a messy dissection. Phyllis Sutton remarked, \"Holly, down in Personnel, showed me a tabulation she ran off for her own curiosity today, Doctor. Do you realize that in this whole hospital there are only _eight_ unmarried female employees?\"  Murt threw water droplets from his bare arms and muttered, \"Yes, and every one of them's giving me the eye--to say nothing of half the married ones.\"  His aide dried her long arms and slender hands and looked at him with a crooked smile. \"Not to underestimate your good looks, Doctor, but I am one of the unmarried females. I trust I'm not giving you too much trouble?\"  He looked up, startled. \"Yes--no, _no_--of course not. I'm referring to the nurses and the technicians. What's got into them? The whole lot seems to be on the make!\"  Phyllis combed out her short dark hair and looked at him in the mirror. \"I assure you the males are just as bad. These interns and four of the male nurses give me a physical with their eyes every time I happen to meet them.\"  \"I suppose this ties in somehow with your pantie-raid theory.\"  \"Well, what do _you_ think?\"  \"I don't think. I just dodge. You'd do well to do the same,\" Murt told her, putting on his jacket and adjusting his tie.  She sat down in his oak swivel-chair and crossed her slender ankles. \"Are you aware of the problem they have downstairs in the out-patient clinic?\"  \"Hadn't heard,\" Murt said.         *       *       *       *       *  She removed a file from her purse and touched up her short nails. \"The outlying clinics are sending their overflow to us. They can't seem to diagnose the odd symptoms they're getting.\"  \"I had noticed the large number of negative test results coming out of the lab,\" Murt acknowledged. \"Haven't followed any of them through, though.\"  \"I have,\" Phyllis said with a little frown. \"Seems to be a psychosomatic nightmare down there.\"  \"What are the symptoms?\"  \"Mostly neurotic,\" she said. \"Listlessness, loss of appetite, palpitations, cold sweats and absent-mindedness.\"  \"Why don't they go to the psychiatric clinics?\"  \"Overloaded. They're sending patients here.\"  \"What age groups?\"  \"From puberty to senility. I'd like your permission to do a little special work on blood samples.\"  \"Another theory?\" he asked caustically.  \"Yes. Will you give me your permission to test it?\"  Murt adjusted his Panama straw in the mirror and noticed that the nostrils of his straight nose were flared for some reason. \"Your time is your own after three P. M. every day. If you want to take time out from your thesis research, that's your business.\"  He crossed to the door and was opening it when he became aware that he had had no answer. He looked back at the profile of his assistant's body, which was now"]]]
