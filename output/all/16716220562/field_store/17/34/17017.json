What about your work schedules?\"  \"I've pushed them as hard as I can without forcing a test of my authority,\" he said. \"They claim they deserve time to get adjusted and relax a little before buckling down.\"  \"I agree with them,\" I said. \"They're all serious, industrious people, and this is still an adventure with them. It will wear off pretty soon, and they'll be yearning for comforts of Earth. They'll buckle down when the rainy season hits,\" I predicted.  \"I wonder. Here's one good example. Look over there. Donnegan's food detail is just now returning with its first load. They left three hours ago.\" He yelled over to the foreman.  Donnegan, a large, pleasant-faced biologist sauntered over to us. Benson said, \"Was the _expedition_ successful?\"  Donnegan brushed off the sarcasm. \"Fooling aside, it is getting to be something of an expedition to find fruit. The natives are cleaning it out near at hand.\"  Turning to me Benson said, \"There's another thing. The little devils have settled all around us, and everything is community property with them. Not only do they strip the fruit but they pick up anything that isn't nailed down and wander off with it.\"  \"That's odd,\" I said. \"Joe indicates that they place no value on possessions normally.\"  \"Oh, they don't keep things,\" Donnegan explained. \"They pack them off, fiddle with them and then we find them strewn all over the forest. Sometimes I'd like to wring their little necks!\"  Benson looked up at him quickly. \"Sounds funny coming from you, Paul. You were one of their chief defenders at the meeting last week.\"  Donnegan's face darkened. \"That was last week, before I found out a few things. As a matter of fact, I think it's time you knew about them, too.\" He squatted down by us and unburdened himself.         *       *       *       *       *  As it so often will, a barrier had erected itself between the colony members and their leader, Phillip Benson. Donnegan somewhat shamefacedly confessed what had gone on behind this curtain of silence.  It seemed that two weeks earlier Bromley, one of the chemists, had contrived some rather crude, old-fashioned, sulphur-and-phosphorus, friction matches. Trading on the native's delight with fire, he had bribed them with matches to give him one of the tala-mangoes which he tasted, then promptly proceeded to swill until he was quite drunk.  In a generous mood he passed out matches to other male members of the colony who, in turn, made the barter and joined the party.  \"The stuff is really delicious,\" Donnegan admitted. \"And it doesn't even give you a hang-over.\"  \"Go on,\" Benson invited coldly.  Within a few days, Donnegan related, everybody was nipping on the tala. Bromley was turning out a steady supply of matches from his lab, and they were now the going currency for trading with the natives. In order to keep their wives quiet the men brought the super-ripe mangoes home and shared them.  The precious fruit, it developed, came from regular mango trees but reached the desired, fermented condition only at the leafy crowns of the trees where even the nimble, light-weight natives found it hazardous and difficult to reach them. Bromley said that he knew of several native casualties from fatal falls that had occurred since the traffic in tala increased.  Benson asked the question that was in my mind. \"What caused you to come to me at this late date?\" he demanded. \"Something more serious must have happened.\"  \"Well, I didn't mind the tala-drinking so much--but, well, Captain Spooner and I came back to his hut one afternoon this week and found his pretty little wife with one of the natives--a male. Spooner thought it was a big joke--he was a little drunk at the time, and so was his wife. But I don't think it's any joke at all.\"  Benson was on his feet, his face livid. \"What else?\"  Bromley said, \"I checked around a little bit, and I found that quite a few of our people are making pets out of the natives. The little devils have got used to our scent, and they'll do anything just to watch a match burn.\"  \"But the quarantine?\" I said.  \"I guess they figure it's safe enough. Personally, I don't. But they feel that since you and Sue have escaped any disease there's no reason for the non-fraternizing rule, not even in closed spaces. Several couples I know hold parties every night in their huts after dark. They invite a couple of natives who supply the tala. They all sit around a candle. The natives sleep there.\"  He kicked at an empty tala skin that Joe had tossed out the door earlier. \"Things are out of hand, and I'm ashamed I haven't come to you sooner, Benson.\"  Phil was so outraged he couldn't speak. I said, \"Thanks, Donnegan. You did the right thing.\"  He left us, and while Benson was struggling to control his anger I said, \"It's a wonder they haven't burned the place down. The forest must be damp enough to sustain fire, or they certainly would have set one.\"  \"It might have been better,\" Benson said, \"if they had burned the whole damned planet up! And you thought I was exaggerating! There you have it, a perfect set-up to make beachcombers out of the whole colony. Plenty of free food, liquor, beautiful native girls and a mild climate.\"  \"And native boys,\" I added, remembering suddenly that I was harboring one of the \"pets\" under my own roof.  Benson clenched his fists. \"From the first I knew what the answer must come to. I just didn't have the guts to face it.\"  I nodded. \"I suppose we'll have to drive them off.\"  \"Drive them off, _nothing_! They're nomads, and they'd be back sooner or later. There will always be people in the colony willing to deal with them secretly, and the natives are clever enough to circumvent any discipline I aim against them.\"  \"What else can you do, short of--genocide?\"  \"Why rule out genocide? Sam, face it! Race extermination is the only permanent and satisfactory solution.\"  The thought was abhorrent to me, but he argued, \"If we don't eliminate them entirely they'll always be around to plague us. Just picture what this or any future colony would look like after a year or two of uninhibited mingling and loafing and swilling down that tala. Is that the civilization that Earth sent us out here to establish?\"  In every part of the universe where living conditions have been too kind and discipline too lax, men have been known to _go native_, and suddenly I felt that Benson had been much more acute in his apprehensions than I, a graduate psychologist who was supposed to understand human nature.  Somewhat subdued I said, \"How do you plan to accomplish a complete extermination? If we start hunting them down they'll just fade into the woods. Besides, you'd have a devil of a time getting agreement among our people to take on such a messy project.\"  \"It has to be done, that's all. I want you to keep completely quiet about what we've learned until I can think about it. Bromley should have some ideas. He's a biologist.\"  When Benson said, \"biologist\", the obvious solution popped into my head. \"If we could sterilize them--all the males, anyway--they have such a short life-span--\"  \"Too slow. Besides, how are you going to coax all the males to lie down and--\" His eyes opened wider, \"Radiation!\"  \"Exactly. We take them for a tour of the ship, including the X-ray booth, and pour on the power.\"  \"Might be done at that. But it would be so slow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Slow or not, no better plan was conceived among six of us who met secretly that night in Benson's new ship quarters. Donnegan brought his fellow biologist, Terrence Frost, and I had contacted the two medics. We reached swift agreement as to the necessity of taking steps, and decided to work on my rough plan. It was also voted not to divulge our intentions to the others, and then the meeting broke up.  When I returned to my hut, Jane was sitting cross-legged just outside my door visiting with Susan. I thought she would be curious about the confidential nature of the meeting from which she was excluded, but she had other things on her mind. She stood up and said, \"I think your patient is recovered, and you've got a problem, mister.\" She stalked off into the night.  I looked at Sue's pink face and half-guessed the answer before she told me. It seemed that Joe had suddenly developed amorous inclinations. Sue had the habit of stroking his head like a pet dog, and this evening, without warning, Joe had begun returning the caresses in a manner so casual and gentle that Sue hadn't noticed the trend.  From a more objective viewpoint, however, Jane had observed the rather unplatonic indications of Joe's attitude and mortified Sue by drawing her attention to it with an acid remark.  In my fury I fancied that Joe had tried to take advantage of my absence. His cleverness in avoiding such advances in my presence was nullified by his error of assuming that Jane would pose no obstacle.  At present he sprawled in his corner beside an empty mango skin, breathing rapidly, innocently asleep. The incident served to drive home Donnegan's story and steel me against the many twinges of conscience I was to suffer in our campaign to wipe out Joe's race.  It also served as an adequate excuse, in Sue's eyes, when I told Joe the next morning that he was quite well enough to return to the forest. This was a fact we both had known for over a week, but Joe in his indolent way, had been quite content to remain and talk with me endlessly. Until now, I had welcomed his presence as an inexhaustible source of information.  He accepted the dismissal without rancor and promised to return and visit us next spring.  \"Next spring?\" I said.  \"We will leave soon,\" he said. \"We go south in the autumn.\"  \"Wait,\" I said. And I told him that as a gesture of friendship we had decided to take all males of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32676"],["title","The Test Colony (#5)"],["body"," race for a tour through the ship. Would he take this word to his people?  He said he would, but his face became very thoughtful.  That afternoon they formed a short line at the ramp, and the \"tours\" began. The line was short because they refused to wait long for anything, but as the line shortened, others came from the woods to take their places. To produce a favorable \"press\" on our show and thus assure perfect attendance by _all_ the males, Benson rigged several mechanical displays of flashing lights and whirling devices.  They were delighted, and when they got to the X-ray booth, to induce them to stand still we set up a gas torch with a beautiful, vermilion, strontium flame. The only problem at this point was to get them to move on after they got their painless dose of sterilizing radiation.  Every tenth \"golden boy\" was shunted into a small chamber filled with _orgon_, the instant anaesthetizing gas, and Dr. Sorenson, wearing an oxygen mask, would catch him as he fell, take his specimen, hand it through a slot to Dr. Bailey and then drag the unsuspecting victim into the fresh air where the nurses took over with more wonders to distract his attention.  This running spot-check on the collected semen samples assured us that our radiation was effectively destroying the spermatozoa.  I sat at my old place at the base of the ramp, weeding out the occasional females who tried to sneak in and also checking to see that we had no repeats.  Our method was simplicity itself. As each native finished our tour an attendant atomized a faint but very permanent stain of waterproof dye on the hair of the right shoulder blade. It was hardly noticeable unless you were looking for it, and that was one of my jobs.  In two days we \"toured\" 481 males.  A week later the night rains began, and our unwelcomed neighbors vanished.         *       *       *       *       *  Benson had postponed his little lecture deliberately, and now he called us all together for a fatherly talk which I helped him prepare. He began abruptly.  \"Since nature has been so bountiful in providing us with tala, I don't intend to proclaim any silly prohibition regarding its consumption. With a little reflection, however, I hope that all of you can understand that we must have some control. I am fully aware that many of you arranged your own private channels for obtaining this liquor, but with the departure of our tree-climbing friends the easy source has dried up.  \"Now, to prevent some of you from breaking your fool necks trying to climb the trees yourselves, I propose that we place tala in the commissary as a normal ration to be issued equitably to all--when it is available. And working together, our clearing parties will, no doubt, fell enough mango trees to give us all a fair taste.\"  Benson's unexpected tolerance and remarkable proposal was received with mixed embarrassment, relief and enthusiasm. He went on, \"We have enjoyed almost two months of rather unrestrained partying, and I'm not going to rail at you for some of the illicit behaviour that came to my attention. So far the intimacies which some of you took with the natives have produced no epidemics nor bastard offspring on either side. However, were I to accept your actions as typical of the future, I would consider our colony doomed already and write off this planet as unfit for further investment by Earth civilization.  \"Instead, I feel you will, during the winter months, regain your perspective and apply yourself to the principles which brought us here and must continue to bind us together if we are to survive as a permanent culture.\"  Benson's speech had the desired effect. Without the little people around to distract us, the colonists plunged into their work, and things got done. True, a rather disproportionate number of logs brought in by the falling crews turned out to be mango-wood, but the tala-rationing program added incentive precisely where it was needed. The perimeter of our clearing advanced rapidly, the cultivating and planting parties followed closely behind, and the sawmill added an industrious sound to the whole operation.  As Benson had hoped, when the people buckled down they once again began yearning for the conveniences they had left on earth. The chemists finally contrived suitable raw materials for the plasticizer and began manufacturing screens for our gaping windows, much-needed pipe for our water and sewage systems and even a few \"frivolous\" luxuries such as cups, saucers and fruit bowls. The commissary and other public buildings were planked out roughly, and the hospital-clinic was completed before the first two babies arrived.  The history-making blessed event was an honor and an onus to Captain Spooner and his young wife. To father the first human offspring on Sirius XXII was the fond hope of many of us, but Spooner and the Second Officer had something over a light-year head-start on the rest of us.  Infant Spooner arrived just 5-1/2 months after our landing. The Mate's baby came two weeks later. Sue herself was satisfyingly pregnant. By spring it was obvious that Earth's gynecologists had chosen the members of our colony well, and there would be no dearth of young blood. Fully a third of the women were expecting, and Sue's date indicated she would have won the derby if it hadn't been for the ship's officers' perfidy.  The colony as a whole was in good shape. As the most pressing work was disposed of, the men took turns at the pleasant hunting details, and we began enjoying fresh meat from the small game of the forest.  On one such trip I brought back a live little animal that looked like a cross between a three-toed sloth and a teddy bear, except that he had a long, woofly snout like an ant-eater. He seemed to be hibernating in the crotch of a small tree, and when I shook him down he cuddled up and clung to my neck so lovingly that I decided he'd make a good pet for Sue.  The little cub kept nipping affectionately at my neck on the hike back, and he clung so close he was a nuisance, but Sue was delighted. We had to improvise a cage at night to keep him from mauling us and keeping us awake.  Sue named him, \"Toots\", and we were the envy of all the camp. When Joe and his people returned three weeks later, and we discovered the truth about Toots, the others were happy they hadn't acquired a similar pet.         *       *       *       *       *  It was late spring, and the mango trees were rapidly refilling their high branches with the tala-fruit. We now had a roofed central kitchen where the women prepared our meals. We ate at long tables in the open.  Shortly after the noon meal one day, Joe and his people returned. He caught up to Sue and me as we were strolling to our hut for our daily fifteen-minute siesta. He appeared tired from the journey but quite glad to see us. I felt the pangs of conscience as I added my hypocritical welcome to Sue's warm greeting.  In his old room we sat on the rough furniture I had fashioned, and Joe eyed Sue's fruitful contours. \"A baby soon, eh? We have many babies among us.\"  \"You--have?\" I said.  \"Many were born on the return trip. They slowed up the females with their sucking. For eight days they are a burden on the mother.\"  Sue exclaimed, \"Eight days? Then what happens?\"  The subject did not greatly interest Joe. \"Then they find their own food--if the _koodi_ does not find them first.\"  \"What in the world is a _koodi_?\" Sue asked with a shiver.  Joe was silent for a minute. He wrinkled his broad brow and looked at me. \"Samrogers, you asked me many questions about how we die. I did not understand this death for a long time. Now I know. It is when the _koodi_ comes. He comes to the very young and to the old. The babies are too small to hold him off. The old drink much tala, then the _koodi_ comes to them. This is my third year, and my thirst for tala is great. The _koodi_ will come.\"  His words painted a clear picture of a superstitious concept of death, personifying it even as humans refer to the \"grim reaper\". But Sue took a different view. \"What does the _koodi_ look like?\" she persisted.  Joe looked puzzled. He raised a long, four-segmented finger and pointed to a corner of the room where Toots was curled up like a fur neck-piece. \"He looks like that. There is a _koodi_.\"  My first impulse was to reject the statement as ridiculous. Toots was as harmless as an over-sized kitten. Besides, the manual made no mention of--  Sue made a small sound in her throat. Her face was colorless. \"Sam! Get him out of here!\"  \"But the manual--\"  \"The manual didn't mention Joe's people, either,\" she said half-hysterically. \"_Get Toots out of here._\"  Still unbelieving I walked over and hauled the little fuzzy animal up into my arms. Instantly, he cuddled close and rammed his pointed snout under my open collar and began nibbling at my neck. I took him outside, and out of perverse curiosity I let him have his way with my neck. At first it tickled, as always, but instead of batting his head away I let him nibble with his soft, pointed lips.  Sue called out, \"Sam what are you doing? Kill him, Sam!\"  His lips spread into a little circle on my flesh and began sucking gently. There was no pain, just the throb of my jugular under his mouth. Now his long, soft, hairy arms became firmer around my neck. I jerked back and they gripped hard. A chill of panic stabbed me, and I could feel the taut flesh of my neck drawn more deeply into his puckered lips.  I tugged at him silently, not wishing to frighten Sue. He wouldn't come loose. In broad, noon-daylight I had a Sirian vampire in my arms, threatening to rupture my jugular vein and kill me within speaking distance of half a hundred people. I tried to level my voice. \"Joe, would you come out here, please?\"  He came at once, stared with a blank expression and said, \"You have been drinking much tala?\"  \"Help me, dammit!\" I said, holding my voice down. \"I can't shake him loose. He's trying to--\" The long, tight"]]]
