And then what?  He yawned, his eyes closing. How sleepy he was! He looked over at the bed. Then he sat down on the edge of it and took his shoes off. So much to do, the next day.  He put his shoes in the corner of the room. Then he bent over, unsnapping one of the suitcases. He opened the suitcase. From it he took a bulging gunnysack. Carefully, he emptied the contents of the sack out on the floor. Dirt, rich soft dirt. Dirt he had collected during his last hours there, dirt he had carefully gathered up.  When the dirt was spread out on the floor he sat down in the middle of it. He stretched himself out, leaning back. When he was fully comfortable he folded his hands across his chest and closed his eyes. So much work to do--But later on, of course. Tomorrow. How warm the dirt was....  He was sound asleep in a moment.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Imagination: Stories of Science and     Fantasy_ February 1953.

She eased her angular body into a more comfortable position in the sack. Still more asleep than awake, her mind reflected tartly that in this lifeboat, hurtling away from their wrecked spaceship back to Earth, the sleeping accommodation was quite appropriately named. On another mental level, she tried to hear more of what was being said about her. Naturally, hearing one's name spoken, one would.  \"We're going to have to tell Miss Kitty as soon as she wakes up.\" It was Sam Eade talking to Lt. Harper--the two men who had escaped with her.  \"Yes, Sam,\" the lieutenant answered. \"What we've suspected all along is pretty definite now.\"  Still drowsing, she wondered, without any real interest, what they felt they must tell her. But the other level of her mind was more real. She wondered how she looked to these two young men while she slept. Did she sleep with her mouth open? Did her tiara slip while she snored?         *       *       *       *       *  Vividly, as in full dreaming, she slipped back into the remembered scene which had given birth to the phrase. At some social gathering she had been about to enter a room. She'd overheard her name spoken then, too.  \"Miss Kitty is probably a cute enough name when you're young,\" the catty woman was saying. \"But at her age!\"  \"Well, I suppose you might say she's kept it for professional reasons,\" the other woman had answered with a false tolerance. \"A school teacher, wanting to be cozy with her kiddies, just a big sister.\" The tolerance was too thin, it broke away. \"Kind of pathetic, I think. She's so plain, so very typical of an old maid school teacher. She's just the kind to keep a name like Miss Kitty.\"  \"What gets me,\" the first one scoffed, \"is her pride in having such a brilliant mind--if she really does have one. All those academic degrees. She wears them on every occasion, like a tiara!\"  She had drawn back from the door. But in her instant and habitual introspection, she realized she was less offended than perversely pleased because, obviously, they were jealous of her intellectual accomplishments, her ability to meet men on their own ground, intellectually as good a man as any man.  The half dream drowsiness was sharply washed away by the belated impact of Sam Eade's question to Lt. Harper. Reality flashed on, and she was suddenly wide awake in the lifeboat heading back to Earth.  [Illustration]  \"What is it you must tell me?\" She spoke loudly and crisply to the men's broad backs where they sat in front of the instrument panel. The implication of the question, itself, that they had been holding something back....  Lt. Harper turned slowly around in his seat and looked at her with that detested expression of amused tolerance which his kind of adult male affected toward females. He was the dark, ruggedly handsome type, the kind who took it for granted that women should fawn over him. The kind who would speak the fatuous cliche that a woman's place was in the home, not gallivanting off to teach colonists' children on the fourth planet of Procyon. Still, perhaps she was unjust, she hardly knew the man.  \"Oh, you awake, Miss Kitty?\" he asked easily. His tone, as always, was diffident, respectful toward her. Odd, she resented that respect from him, when she would have resented lack of it even more.  \"Certainly,\" she snapped. \"What is it you must tell me?\"  \"When you're dressed, freshened up a bit,\" he answered, not evasively, but as if it could wait.         *       *       *       *       *  She started to insist, but he had already turned back to the nose window to study the starry sky and the huge misty green ball of Earth in front of them. Sam Eade, the radioman, was intently twisting the dials on his set with a puckered frown between his blond eyebrows. He was an entirely different type, tall, blond, but just as fatuously masculine, as arrogantly handsome. Probably neither one of them had an ounce of brains--handsome people so seldom needed to develop mental ability.  Sam, too, turned his face farther away from her. Both backs told her plainly that she could dress, take care of her needs, with as much privacy as the lifeboat could allow anybody.  Not that it would take her long. She'd worn coveralls since the catastrophe, saving the dress she'd had on for landing on Earth. They'd had to leave most of her luggage behind. The lieutenant had insisted on taking up most of the spare space in the lifeboat with that dismantled space warper from the wreck of their ship.  She combed her short graying hair back of her ears, and used a little water sparingly to brush her teeth. Perhaps it had been a quixotic thing, her giving up a secure teaching post on Earth to go out to Procyon IV. Except that she'd dreamed about a new colony where the rising generation, under her influence, would value intellect--with the girls no different from the boys. Perhaps it had been even sillier to take a cabin on a freighter, the only passenger with a crew of four men. But men did not intimidate her, and on a regular passenger ship she'd have been bored stiff by having to associate with the women.  Two of the men....  It wasn't quite clear to her, even yet, what had happened. They'd used the normal drive to get clear of regular solar shipping lanes. The warning bell had rung that they were about to warp into hyperspace, a mechanism which canceled out distance and made the trip in apparent time no more than an overnight jaunt to Mars. There was a grinding shudder--then a twisted ship which looked as if some giant had taken a wet rag and torqued it to squeeze out the water. Lt. Harper and Sam had got her out of her cabin, and finally into the lifeboat which was only partly crippled.  The other two men of the crew....  She zipped up the front of her coveralls with a crisp gesture, as if to snap off the vision. She would show no weakness in front of these two men. She had no weakness to show!  \"All right, gentlemen,\" she said incisively to their backs. \"Now. What is it I must be told?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lt. Harper pointed to the ball of Earth so close ahead. It was huge, almost filling the sky in front of them. The misty atmosphere blurred outlines slightly, but she could make out the Eastern halves of North and South America clearly. The Western portions were still in dim darkness.  \"See anything wrong, Miss Kitty?\" the lieutenant asked quietly.  She looked more closely, sensing a possible trap in his question, a revealment of her lack of knowledge.  \"I'm not an authority on celestial geography,\" she said cautiously, academically. \"But obviously the maps I've seen were not accurate in showing the true continental proportions.\" She pointed to a small chart hanging on the side wall. \"This map shows Florida, for example, a much longer peninsula than it actually is. A number of things like that. I don't see anything else wrong, but, of course, it's not my field of knowledge.\"  Lt. Harper looked at her approvingly, the kind of look she gave a bright pupil who'd been especially discerning.  \"Only it's not the map that's wrong, Miss Kitty,\" he said. \"It is _my_ field of knowledge, and I've seen those continental outlines hundreds of times. They always corresponded to the map ... before.\"  She looked at him without comprehension.  \"Not only that,\" Sam Eade entered the conversation. \"As soon as we were clear of the wreck, Lt. Harper took a fix on stars and constellations. He's an astrogator. He knows his business. And they were wrong, too. Just a little wrong, here and there, but enough. And even more than that. On a tight beam, I should have been able to make a connection with Earth headquarters on this set. And I haven't yet got communication, and we know there's nothing wrong with this set.\"  \"Sam knows his business, too, Miss Kitty,\" Lt. Harper said. \"If he can't get communication, it's because there isn't any.\"  She looked wide-eyed from one to the other. For once, she was more concerned with a problem than with concealing her ignorance about it.  \"It means,\" the lieutenant said, as if he were answering a question she hadn't yet asked, \"that the Earth we are returning to is not the Earth we left.\"  \"I don't understand,\" she gasped.  \"There's a theory,\" Lt. Harper answered slowly. \"Heretofore it has been considered only a mathematical abstraction, and having no counterpart in reality. The theory of multiple dimensions.\" She looked at him closely, and in her habitual ambivalence of thought reflected that he sounded much more intelligent than she had suspected.  \"I've read about that,\" she answered.  He looked relieved, and threw a quick look at Sam. Apparently he had underestimated her intelligence, too--in spite of all her degrees.         *       *       *       *       *  \"We never thought it could be real,\" he emphasized. \"But the theory was that multiple universes lay side by side, perhaps each an instant's time away from the other. The only thing I can see is that some flaw in the space warper threw us out of our dimension into another one closely adjacent--not far enough for things to be totally different, just different enough that the duplication isn't identical. It's Earth, but it's not our Earth. It's a New Earth, one we don't know anything about.\"  \"In another few hours, we'll be entering the atmosphere,\" Sam put in, \"and we don't know what we'll find. We thought you ought to know.\"  She flared in exasperation at the simple assumption of male arrogance.  \"Of course I should know!\" she snapped back. \"I am "]]]
