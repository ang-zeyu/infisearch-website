But if the girl was disappointed in the size of the place, the beauty of the surroundings made up for it. She gave an ecstatic \"Oh,\" at the sight of the broad esplanade with the noble river washing the base of the bluff which jutted out into a bed of sandstone that formed a natural landing for boats. Several steamboats lay at anchor and Jeanne's attention was drawn to them by the singing of the blacks as they hurried to and from the wharf loading the steamers with freight. It was a weird plantation refrain in the minor key. Jeanne had never heard anything like it, and she listened intently as the song grew louder and louder as the enthusiasm of the blacks increased:      \"Ma sistah, done you want to get religin?     Go down in de lonesum valley,     Go down in de lonesum valley,     Go down in de lonesum valley, ma Lohd,     To meet ma Jesus dar.\"  Over and over they sang the refrain, and the girl was so interested that she did not hear Mr. Huntsworth's approach.  \"Well, what do you think of the South?\" he asked.  \"I like it. Mr. Huntsworth, just listen to those negroes sing. Isn't it musical?\"  \"They call them niggers here,\" said Mr. Huntsworth smiling. \"Yes; their singing is melodious. I have always liked to listen to it. Sometime in the future, I fancy, more will be made of those melodies than we dream of now. When you go down the river you will hear more of it. Some of their songs are very quaint. Do you know that we will have to see General Wallace to obtain a permit to go into the enemy's country?\"  \"General Wallace?\" repeated Jeanne. \"Why?\"  \"The town is under martial law with General Wallace in command. I have been wondering what will be the best for you to do. To come with me to Corinth, for we can go there without difficulty, or for you to stick to the river route as you had intended. I have learned that Vicksburg is not in our hands after all. Its capitulation was a false report. Farragut is waiting for Halleck to send troops to occupy it and is still keeping up the bombardment.\"  \"But a boat could get through, could it not?\"  \"Yes; I think so. Davis guards the stream above Vicksburg while the Commodore holds the lower part. I'll talk with General Wallace about it. Meantime after we have had breakfast you can walk along this esplanade, and see something of the place. You will not get lost, will you?\"  \"No, indeed,\" laughed Jeanne. \"I came from New York, you know. I should be able to get around a little place like this.\"  \"Very well, then.\"  Jeanne donned her hat and wandered along the wide esplanade viewing the city, the river and the surrounding country. She walked on and on until finally she had wandered some distance from the hotel and the buildings were growing farther and farther apart when she was startled by a groan.  Looking about her she beheld a young fellow of about twenty-one years clad in the blue uniform of the United States lying upon the ground. Without a thought but that one of the soldiers was suffering Jeanne sprang to his side and knelt beside him.  \"What is it?\" she cried. \"Are you hurt?\"  \"Just faint,\" murmured the young man in a weak voice, and the girl noted with surprise the Southern accent. \"I'll be all right in a moment.\"  \"Smell this.\" Jeanne thrust her bottle of smelling salts under his nose, and began to chafe his forehead vigorously. \"There! You're better now, aren't you?\"  \"Much better.\" The young fellow struggled to a sitting posture and smiled wanly. \"What a good little thing you are!\"  \"Well, I like soldiers,\" said Jeanne. \"My brother, Dick, is one, and whenever I see a soldier suffering I always want to do something for him. You are fighting for us, you know. Are you sick?\"  \"No; but I have been. I just came out of the hospital a few days ago, and I am not so strong as I thought.\"  \"You should go home and stay until you get well,\" said the girl with a quaint assumption of maternal authority.  \"Home! I have none.\" The young man's brow darkened. \"If I were to go to my home, I would be spurned from its doors.\"  \"But why?\" cried Jeanne.  \"Listen, and you shall hear, child. I am a native of the state of Louisiana. I was educated at West Point, and when the war broke out had just graduated. You know the conditions under which we are entered, do you not?\"  Jeanne shook her head.  \"We are to serve the country four years for the education given, so when the war came I felt it my duty to give those four years. I went to my father and told him so briefly. 'Never darken my door again while you wear that uniform,' he said. 'You are no son of mine if you side in with a horde of miscreants sent to invade the sacred soil of the South.' I told him that it was my duty. That I had but just graduated and that my honor demanded that I should repay my debt to the government, but he would not listen. So I left him.\"  \"But have you no friends?\" asked Jeanne, her face aglow with compassion.  \"Friends? No; they fight on the other side,\" was the bitter reply. \"And what do these Yankees care for me? They don't realize what I have given up.\"  \"But we do care,\" cried the girl. \"My father and mother just love soldiers. Oh, if you would only go to them they would care for you. Do go. Will you?\"  A smile lighted up the young man's face as he noted her warmth.  \"I wish all your people were like you,\" he said. \"It would not be so hard to do my duty then.\"  \"We are all just alike,\" said Jeanne. \"My father would be proud to have you honor his house. And you are an officer, too,\" she added, glancing at his epaulets.  \"Only a lieutenant.\"  \"Well, it doesn't matter what you are since you are a soldier. Have you a pencil and paper?\"  \"Yes; why?\"  \"I want to give you my father's address. You will go there, won't you?\"  \"My little girl,\" the young man's voice was husky. \"I couldn't do that, you know. Why, it would be monstrous to intrude upon them.\"  \"No; it would not,\" declared Jeanne. \"I wish I were going home. I'd make you go with me. But won't you go? Truly they would welcome you as if you were Dick, my brother. And if you don't go, I'll always feel as if something had happened to you just because you had no place to go. You have done a great deal for our side, you know.\"  \"Well, I'll promise,\" said the soldier a little wearily, as if it were beyond his strength to prolong the argument. \"Where do they live?\"  \"In New York City,\" and Jeanne rapidly penciled the address.  \"Then it is utterly out of the question. I can't promise you.\"  \"I know,\" said Jeanne quickly. \"You haven't any money.\"  A flush passed over the Lieutenant's face.  \"Soldiers never do have, Dick says,\" went on the girl, taking out her purse in a matter-of-fact way.  \"No--no, I--I can't do that,\" groaned the soldier. \"Merciful goodness, has it come to this? That I should receive charity from a child!\"  \"It isn't charity,\" cried Jeanne hotly. \"You can pay it back to my father if you like. I want you to get good and strong so that you can fight for us again.\"  \"I'll do it,\" exclaimed the young fellow impulsively. \"A few weeks' rest would put new life in me. And I'll be your soldier, little girl.\"  \"Will you?\" cried Jeanne delightedly. \"That will be most as good as if I could fight myself, won't it?\"  \"Every bit,\" declared the Lieutenant rising. \"God bless you, child. Such warm hearts as yours make life seem worth the living after all.\"  He raised her hand to his lips. Then as if afraid to trust himself to speak further left her abruptly. Excited and happy Jeanne ran back to the hotel where she found Mr. Huntsworth waiting for her.     CHAPTER VI  IN DIXIE LAND   \"Oh, Mr. Huntsworth,\" she cried, \"I have something to tell you,\" and she rapidly related the incident of the young Lieutenant.  \"Are you sure the fellow was telling the truth?\" queried the old man smiling at her enthusiasm. \"Sometimes rascals tell all sorts of stories in order to get money.\"  \"This man was a gentleman and I know he was truthful. He didn't want to take the money at all. I had to plead with him to get him to do it. Besides he did not speak to me until I had spoken to him first. He was not strong enough for duty and he showed it.\"  \"Then, my dear, you have done a noble thing. If the young man told the truth his position is indeed a sad one. His rebel kinsmen would turn from him if he espoused the cause of the Union and his duty is doubly hard that he must fight against father, home, neighbors and friends. I am afraid that we do not appreciate all that a man gives up when, a Southerner by birth, he throws his lot in with ours. Many high-minded men have gone with the South because their state went that way, and it takes nobleness indeed to rise above the call of one's own state when the government demands the sacrifice. I should like to have seen the young fellow. Did he give his name?\"  \"Why, I did not think to ask it,\" exclaimed Jeanne. \"But father will know of course.\"  \"So you really believe that he will go to your father's.\"  \"Certainly I do.\"  \"Oh, for the faith of childhood,\" exclaimed Mr. Huntsworth. \"But whether he does or not you seemed to have infused new life into him and that is what a man needs most when he is discouraged. You are a true patriot, child. But now, my little Quixote, let's go to General Wallace. I have explained everything to him, but he desires to see you personally.\"  The headquarters of Gen. Lewis Wallace who was at this time in charge of the city of Memphis were soon reached, and Jeanne and her friend were ushered into his presence. A man of medium height, rather slender in build, stern of feature but whose eyes beamed with kindness, serious of mien and visage and habited in a plain suit of blue flannel with two stars upon his shoulders denoting a Major-General in the United States Army, rose to greet them. Full of chivalric dash, possessing a cool head with a capacity for large plans and the steady nerve to execute whatever he conceived, the young General was an interesting figure and Jeanne gazed at him with some curiosity.  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32993"],["title","A Daughter of the Union (#7)"],["body","So, my little maid,\" said the General. \"You wish to go to New Orleans?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jeanne returning his scrutiny modestly.  \"Do you not know that it will be a difficult matter to do so? Farragut is still storming the batteries of Vicksburg and while a transport goes this morning to take supplies to Captain Davis, and you could go down that far on it, still it is scarcely the time for a girl to make a visit.\"  \"I must go, General,\" said Jeanne firmly.  \"Will you tell me why, my child?\"  \"I cannot, sir.\"  \"But I cannot let you subject yourself to danger unless there is some necessity for it. It seems to me that a mere visit could be postponed until a safer season. Now unless there are urgent reasons for it I feel compelled to forbid your going.\"  \"Sir,\" said Jeanne blushing at her temerity yet speaking boldly notwithstanding, \"there are urgent reasons for my going. I do not wish to tell them because they concern the government. But my father would not have let me come had there not been necessity.\"  \"You surely do not mean that you are an emissary of the government?\" exclaimed the General in surprise. \"Why, you are but a little girl.\"  \"But exceedingly patriotic, General,\" interrupted Mr. Huntsworth. \"She has given a fair to raise money for the soldiers, made I don't know how many shirts, socks and handkerchiefs and just now emptied her purse to send a soldier home to her parents to be taken care of. Best of all she can relish a pun when she hears one which you will agree is a rare accomplishment for a girl or even a woman. Oh, she is capable of anything.\"  \"I believe it,\" laughed the General. \"I fear that I shall have to give up before such a formidable array of accomplishments. Have you really done all those things?\"  \"All but the shirts,\" answered Jeanne shyly, \"mother makes those. You see father works for the government, mother is in the Women's Relief Association and Dick is in the army, so I just had to do something to help too.\"  \"I see,\" said the General. \"What is your father's name?\"  \"Richard Vance, sir.\"  \"Richard Vance!\" exclaimed the General. \"Oh! I understand everything now. You shall go to New Orleans, child, if our boats can get you there. The transport will start in an hour. Can you be ready to go by that time?\"  \"I am ready now, sir.\"  \"That is the bearing of a true soldier,\" approved the General. \"I will give you a letter to Farragut----\"  \"I have one to Commodore Porter, sir,\" interrupted Jeanne, producing the missive. \"He is my father's friend.\"  \"That is all right,\" General Wallace hastily scanned the letter. \"But I will add a few lines to Farragut. Success to you, my child.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" answered Jeanne gratefully.  \"Now we will amuse ourselves by walking about a little until the transport starts,\" said Mr. Huntsworth as they left the room. \"My train goes this afternoon.\"  \"Then I shall have to tell you good-bye soon,\" said the girl regretfully. \"I am sorry, Mr. Huntsworth. You have been very kind to me. My journey would not have been so easy had it not been for you.\"  \"Tut, tut, I have done nothing,\" said the old gentleman. \"I have pleased myself in helping you. I was glad to have such a bright little companion. And we shall meet again, my dear. I promise you that. I am not going to lose sight of my little comrade easily. I want to bring my daughter, Anne, to see you when you get home.\"  \"I wish you would,\" replied Jeanne. \"I should like to know her. Mr. Huntsworth, don't you think I might send a telegram to my father from here to let him know that I am all right and about to start for New Orleans?\"  \"Why, bless my soul, child! That is the very thing to do! What a head you have! There is the office on the other side of the street.\"  \"Yes; that was what made me think of it.\"  The telegram dispatched, the two wended their way to Jackson Park.  The statue of the old hero of New Orleans stood in the centre of the green. It was inclosed by a circular iron fence and ornamented by carefully trained shrubbery. The bust of the hero was placed on the top of a plain shaft of marble about eight feet high. On the north side of the shaft was an inscription.  \"Look!\" exclaimed Mr. Huntsworth. \"Some rampant rebel has marred that inscription.\"  Jeanne looked and saw the writing which read \"The Federal Union: It Must be Preserved\"--the words Federal and Union had been chipped out, presenting an appearance as if a small hammer had been struck across them.  \"The villain!\" continued the old gentleman irascibly. \"He ought to be hung who ever he is!\"  \"It is a pity,\" said Jeanne. \"Isn't this a cruel war, Mr. Huntsworth, that the things both the North and South have been so proud of now become hateful to one part of the country? I never thought so much about it until since I met that young man this morning.\"  \"It is a terrible thing for brothers to be arrayed against each other as we are,\" assented Mr. Huntsworth. \"But don't think about it too much. It is a pity that your young life should be clouded by the knowledge. You think too much for your age.\"  \"I am better for it,\" said Jeanne. \"Wouldn't it be dreadful for me to laugh and play and be glad all day when the country is in peril? Every one ought to think.\"  \"Perhaps you are right. But sometimes I have heard you say things that made me think you a bit uncanny, as the Scotch say. I am going to advise your father to turn you out to grass when the war is over. I suppose it would be useless to urge such a thing so long as the war continues.\"  \"'To turn me out to grass,'\" laughed Jeanne. \"What a funny expression. Do you mean for me to live in the fields like the cows and the horses?\"  \"Well, something on that order,\" smiled Mr. Huntsworth. \"Your father will understand what I mean. See, there is your steamer, child. I will see you aboard and then I must say good-bye.\"  The steamer which had been a passenger packet plying her trade between St. Louis and New Orleans before the war had been converted into a transport for carrying men and supplies for the government. As Mr. Huntsworth and Jeanne ascended the gangplank they were met by the Captain.  \"Is this the young lady who is to be our guest down the river?\" he asked in such a hearty way that Jeanne's heart warmed to him immediately. \"General Wallace advised me that I was to expect one.\"  \"This is the girl, Captain,\" replied Mr. Huntsworth. \"And I hope for your sake that you and your crew are thoroughly Union, otherwise it would be better for you to meet with a rebel ram. I don't believe that the Johnnies could make it any warmer for you than she could.\"  \"This is just the place for her then,\" declared the Captain smilingly. \"We are Union to the core, Miss Vance. I believe that is your name.\"  \"Yes, sir; my name is Jeanne Vance, but please do not call me 'Miss Vance.' It makes me feel so strange.\"  \"All right, my little girl. I will do as you say. I am glad that you have no grown-up notions about you. I foresee that we shall get along famously. This is the way to the cabin, and that room is where you will bunk. It is next to mine. You can call on me or Tennessee for anything you need.\"  \"Tennessee!\" ejaculated Jeanne with a puzzled look.  \"Yes; our cook. We call her Tenny for short, and she is about the jolliest old darky that ever trod a deck. A good motherly woman with a white soul if she is black. Now make yourself comfortable. I will send Tenny to you to help you. I have some things to attend to on deck.\"  \"Isn't he kind?\" exclaimed Jeanne. \"How good people are to girls traveling alone!\"  \"It is because they are Americans,\" said Mr. Huntsworth. \"You should be proud of such a country. I am glad that you have fallen into such pleasant hands. I will tell your father if I see him before you do. Will you stay in New Orleans long?\"  \"I don't know. I will have to hear from my father about that. But how easy it has been to get there!\"  \"The most difficult part is to come,\" said the old gentleman gravely. \"Once the Vicksburg batteries are passed you will be safe. I do not think that this boat will try to make the run. She is hardly in fighting shape. Of course you will be transferred to a gun boat. Well, well, I hope that you will get through all right and that we will soon meet again. Good-bye, little girl.\"  \"Good-bye, sir,\" and Jeanne shook hands with him cordially. \"Thank you so much for all your kindness. I hope that I will see you again. Good-bye.\"  Another hand shake and the old gentleman left the cabin slowly, and went on shore.  \"Done you feel bad, honey,\" and a fat negress came up to her as she sat down on the side of her berth feeling rather forlorn. \"Wus dat yer par?\"  \"No,\" and Jeanne looked up quickly with a smile. \"Are you Tennessee? I am glad to see you. The Captain told me about you.\"  \"Yes; I'se Tennessee, honey, but lawsie! Dey doesn't call me nuffin but Tenny. But ef yer want ter see the las' ob de ole gem'muns jest foller yer aunty ter de deck.\"  Jeanne followed the negress, and stood on the deck watching the preparations for departure. Mr. Huntsworth saw her and waved his hand. Jeanne waved hers in response, and as the transport backed out into the river and steamed southward, she gazed at him until his figure grew to be a tiny speck and then disappeared in the distance.  \"Now, missy, I'se got ter ten' ter de dinner, but you can kum wid me ef yer likes, elsen you can stay hyar and watch de ribber. Most folks likes ter do dat. I 'spect mebbe dats de best thing fer yer.\"  \"Well, then I will stay, Mrs. Tenny,\" smiled Jeanne.  \"Mrs. Tenny! Huh! Who is yer talkin' to, honey? I'se jest Tenny or aunty jest as yer likes. But done go ter puttin' no missis on to it. White folks done do dat down hyar.\"  \"Then I will call you Tenny,\" said Jeanne, recoiling just a little from calling the woman aunty. \"But it doesn't seem right not to say Mrs.\"  \"Yes, missy, it's all right. Now I'll get up a good dinner. 'Specks you is powerful hungry, ain't yer? Ole Tenny gwine ter do her bes' fer de little"]]]
