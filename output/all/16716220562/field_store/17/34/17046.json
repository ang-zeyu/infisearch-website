They live on the shores of Lake Zuad, near the border of Kush. They're a sort of mongrel Stygians, mixed with another race that wandered into Stygia from the east some centuries ago and were absorbed by them. They're called Tlazitlans. I'm willing to bet it wasn't they who built this city, though.\"  Techotl's fear did not seem to diminish as they drew away from the chamber where the dead men lay. He kept twisting his head on his shoulder to listen for sounds of pursuit, and stared with burning intensity into every doorway they passed.  Valeria shivered in spite of herself. She feared no man. But the weird floor beneath her feet, the uncanny jewels over her head, dividing the lurking shadows among them, the stealth and terror of their guide, impressed her with a nameless apprehension, a sensation of lurking, inhuman peril.  \"They may be between us and Tecuhltli!\" he whispered once. \"We must beware lest they be lying in wait!\"  \"Why don't we get out of this infernal palace, and take to the streets?\" demanded Valeria.  \"There are no streets in Xuchotl,\" he answered. \"No squares nor open courts. The whole city is built like one giant palace under one great roof. The nearest approach to a street is the Great Hall which traverses the city from the north gate to the south gate. The only doors opening into the outer world are the city gates, through which no living man has passed for fifty years.\"  \"How long have you dwelt here?\" asked Conan.  \"I was born in the castle of Tecuhltli thirty-five years ago. I have never set foot outside the city. For the love of the gods, let us go silently! These halls may be full of lurking devils. Olmec shall tell you all when we reach Tecuhltli.\"  So in silence they glided on with the green fire-stones blinking overhead and the flaming floors smoldering under their feet, and it seemed to Valeria as if they fled through hell, guided by a dark-faced, lank-haired goblin.  Yet it was Conan who halted them as they were crossing an unusually wide chamber. His wilderness-bred ears were keener even than the ears of Techotl, whetted though these were by a lifetime of warfare in those silent corridors.  \"You think some of your enemies may be ahead of us, lying in ambush?\"  \"They prowl through these rooms at all hours,\" answered Techotl, \"as do we. The halls and chambers between Tecuhltli and Xotalanc are a disputed region, owned by no man. We call it the Halls of Silence. Why do you ask?\"  \"Because men are in the chambers ahead of us,\" answered Conan. \"I heard steel clink against stone.\"  Again a shaking seized Techotl, and he clenched his teeth to keep them from chattering.  \"Perhaps they are your friends,\" suggested Valeria.  \"We dare not chance it,\" he panted, and moved with frenzied activity. He turned aside and glided through a doorway on the left which led into a chamber from which an ivory staircase wound down into darkness.  \"This leads to an unlighted corridor below us!\" he hissed, great beads of perspiration standing out on his brow. \"They may be lurking there, too. It may all be a trick to draw us into it. But we must take the chance that they have laid their ambush in the rooms above. Come swiftly, now!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Softly as phantoms they descended the stair and came to the mouth of a corridor black as night. They crouched there for a moment, listening, and then melted into it. As they moved along, Valeria's flesh crawled between her shoulders in momentary expectation of a sword-thrust in the dark. But for Conan's iron fingers gripping her arm she had no physical cognizance of her companions. Neither made as much noise as a cat would have made. The darkness was absolute. One hand, outstretched, touched a wall, and occasionally she felt a door under her fingers. The hallway seemed interminable.  Suddenly they were galvanized by a sound behind them. Valeria's flesh crawled anew, for she recognized it as the soft opening of a door. Men had come into the corridor behind them. Even with the thought she stumbled over something that felt like a human skull. It rolled across the floor with an appalling clatter.  \"Run!\" yelped Techotl, a note of hysteria in his voice, and was away down the corridor like a flying ghost.  Again Valeria felt Conan's hand bearing her up and sweeping her along as they raced after their guide. Conan could see in the dark no better than she, but he possessed a sort of instinct that made his course unerring. Without his support and guidance she would have fallen or stumbled against the wall. Down the corridor they sped, while the swift patter of flying feet drew closer and closer, and then suddenly Techotl panted: \"Here is the stair! After me, quick! Oh, quick!\"  His hand came out of the dark and caught Valeria's wrist as she stumbled blindly on the steps. She felt herself half dragged, half lifted up the winding stair, while Conan released her and turned on the steps, his ears and instincts telling him their foes were hard at their backs. _And the sounds were not all those of human feet._  Something came writhing up the steps, something that slithered and rustled and brought a chill in the air with it. Conan lashed down with his great sword and felt the blade shear through something that might have been flesh and bone, and cut deep into the stair beneath. Something touched his foot that chilled like the touch of frost, and then the darkness beneath him was disturbed by a frightful thrashing and lashing, and a man cried out in agony.  The next moment Conan was racing up the winding staircase, and through a door that stood open at the head.  Valeria and Techotl were already through, and Techotl slammed the door and shot a bolt across it--the first Conan had seen since they left the outer gate.  Then he turned and ran across the well-lighted chamber into which they had come, and as they passed through the farther door, Conan glanced back and saw the door groaning and straining under heavy pressure violently applied from the other side.  Though Techotl did not abate either his speed or his caution, he seemed more confident now. He had the air of a man who has come into familiar territory, within call of friends.  But Conan renewed his terror by asking: \"What was that thing that I fought on the stair?\"  \"The men of Xotalanc,\" answered Techotl, without looking back. \"I told you the halls were full of them.\"  \"This wasn't a man,\" grunted Conan. \"It was something that crawled, and it was as cold as ice to the touch. I think I cut it asunder. It fell back on the men who were following us, and must have killed one of them in its death throes.\"  Techotl's head jerked back, his face ashy again. Convulsively he quickened his pace.  \"It was the Crawler! A monster _they_ have brought out of the catacombs to aid them! What it is, we do not know, but we have found our people hideously slain by it. In Set's name, hasten! If they put it on our trail, it will follow us to the very doors of Tecuhltli!\"  \"I doubt it,\" grunted Conan. \"That was a shrewd cut I dealt it on the stair.\"  \"Hasten! Hasten!\" groaned Techotl.  They ran through a series of green-lit chambers, traversed a broad hall, and halted before a giant bronze door.  Techotl said: \"This is Tecuhltli!\"     _3. The People of the Feud_   Techotl smote on the bronze door with his clenched hand, and then turned sidewise, so that he could watch back along the hall.  \"Men have been smitten down before this door, when they thought they were safe,\" he said.  \"Why don't they open the door?\" asked Conan.  \"They are looking at us through the Eye,\" answered Techotl. \"They are puzzled at the sight of you.\" He lifted his voice and called: \"Open the door, Xecelan! It is I, Techotl, with friends from the great world beyond the forest!--They will open,\" he assured his allies.  \"They'd better do it in a hurry, then,\" said Conan grimly. \"I hear something crawling along the floor beyond the hall.\"  Techotl went ashy again and attacked the door with his fists, screaming: \"Open, you fools, open! The Crawler is at our heels!\"  Even as he beat and shouted, the great bronze door swung noiselessly back, revealing a heavy chain across the entrance, over which spear-heads bristled and fierce countenances regarded them intently for an instant. Then the chain was dropped and Techotl grasped the arms of his friends in a nervous frenzy and fairly dragged them over the threshold. A glance over his shoulder just as the door was closing showed Conan the long dim vista of the hall, and dimly framed at the other end an ophidian shape that writhed slowly and painfully into view, flowing in a dull-hued length from a chamber door, its hideous blood-stained head wagging drunkenly. Then the closing door shut off the view.  Inside the square chamber into which they had come heavy bolts were drawn across the door, and the chain locked into place. The door was made to stand the battering of a siege. Four men stood on guard, of the same lank-haired, dark-skinned breed as Techotl, with spears in their hands and swords at their hips. In the wall near the door there was a complicated contrivance of mirrors which Conan guessed was the Eye Techotl had mentioned, so arranged that a narrow, crystal-paned slot in the wall could be looked through from within without being discernible from without. The four guardsmen stared at the strangers with wonder, but asked no question, nor did Techotl vouchsafe any information. He moved with easy confidence now, as if he had shed his cloak of indecision and fear the instant he crossed the threshold.  \"Come!\" he urged his new-found friends, but Conan glanced toward the door.  \"What about those fellows who were following us? Won't they try to storm that door?\"  Techotl shook his head.  \"They know they cannot break down the Door"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32759"],["title","Red Nails (#8)"],["body","the Eagle. They will flee back to Xotalanc, with their crawling fiend. Come! I will take you to the rulers of Tecuhltli.\"         *       *       *       *       *  One of the four guards opened the door opposite the one by which they had entered, and they passed through into a hallway which, like most of the rooms on that level, was lighted by both the slot-like skylights and the clusters of winking fire-gems. But unlike the other rooms they had traversed, this hall showed evidences of occupation. Velvet tapestries adorned the glossy jade walls, rich rugs were on the crimson floors, and the ivory seats, benches and divans were littered with satin cushions.  The hall ended in an ornate door, before which stood no guard. Without ceremony Techotl thrust the door open and ushered his friends into a broad chamber, where some thirty dark-skinned men and women lounging on satin-covered couches sprang up with exclamations of amazement.  The men, all except one, were of the same type as Techotl, and the women were equally dark and strange-eyed, though not unbeautiful in a weird dark way. They wore sandals, golden breast-plates, and scanty silk skirts supported by gem-crusted girdles, and their black manes, cut square at their naked shoulders, were bound with silver circlets.  On a wide ivory seat on a jade dais sat a man and a woman who differed subtly from the others. He was a giant, with an enormous sweep of breast and the shoulders of a bull. Unlike the others, he was bearded, with a thick, blue-black beard which fell almost to his broad girdle. He wore a robe of purple silk which reflected changing sheens of color with his every movement, and one wide sleeve, drawn back to his elbow, revealed a forearm massive with corded muscles. The band which confined his blue-black locks was set with glittering jewels.  The woman beside him sprang to her feet with a startled exclamation as the strangers entered, and her eyes, passing over Conan, fixed themselves with burning intensity on Valeria. She was tall and lithe, by far the most beautiful woman in the room. She was clad more scantily even than the others; for instead of a skirt she wore merely a broad strip of gilt-worked purple cloth fastened to the middle of her girdle which fell below her knees. Another strip at the back of her girdle completed that part of her costume, which she wore with a cynical indifference. Her breast-plates and the circlet about her temples were adorned with gems. In her eyes alone of all the dark-skinned people there lurked no brooding gleam of madness. She spoke no word after her first exclamation; she stood tensely, her hands clenched, staring at Valeria.  The man on the ivory seat had not risen.  \"Prince Olmec,\" spoke Techotl, bowing low, with arms outspread and the palms of his hands turned upward, \"I bring allies from the world beyond the forest. In the Chamber of Tezcoti the Burning Skull slew Chicmec, my companion----\"  \"The Burning Skull!\" It was a shuddering whisper of fear from the people of Tecuhltli.  \"Aye! Then came I, and found Chicmec lying with his throat cut. Before I could flee, the Burning Skull came upon me, and when I looked upon it my blood became as ice and the marrow of my bones melted. I could neither fight nor run. I could only await the stroke. Then came this white-skinned woman and struck him down with her sword; and lo, it was only a dog of Xotalanc with white paint upon his skin and the living skull of an ancient wizard upon his head! Now that skull lies in many pieces, and the dog who wore it is a dead man!\"  An indescribably fierce exultation edged the last sentence, and was echoed in the low, savage exclamations from the crowding listeners.  \"But wait!\" exclaimed Techotl. \"There is more! While I talked with the woman, four Xotalancas came upon us! One I slew--there is the stab in my thigh to prove how desperate was the fight. Two the woman killed. But we were hard pressed when this man came into the fray and split the skull of the fourth! Aye! Five crimson nails there are to be driven into the pillar of vengeance!\"  He pointed at a black column of ebony which stood behind the dais. Hundreds of red dots scarred its polished surface--the bright scarlet heads of heavy copper nails driven into the black wood.  \"Five red nails for five Xotalanca lives!\" exulted Techotl, and the horrible exultation in the faces of the listeners made them inhuman.  \"Who are these people?\" asked Olmec, and his voice was like the low, deep rumble of a distant bull. None of the people of Xuchotl spoke loudly. It was as if they had absorbed into their souls the silence of the empty halls and deserted chambers.  \"I am Conan, a Cimmerian,\" answered the barbarian briefly. \"This woman is Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, an Aquilonian pirate. We are deserters from an army on the Darfar border, far to the north, and are trying to reach the coast.\"  The woman on the dais spoke loudly, her words tripping in her haste.  \"You can never reach the coast! There is no escape from Xuchotl! You will spend the rest of your lives in this city!\"  \"What do you mean?\" growled Conan, clapping his hand to his hilt and stepping about so as to face both the dais and the rest of the room. \"Are you telling us we're prisoners?\"  \"She did not mean that,\" interposed Olmec. \"We are your friends. We would not restrain you against your will. But I fear other circumstances will make it impossible for you to leave Xuchotl.\"  His eyes flickered to Valeria, and he lowered them quickly.  \"This woman is Tascela,\" he said. \"She is a princess of Tecuhltli. But let food and drink be brought our guests. Doubtless they are hungry, and weary from their long travels.\"  He indicated an ivory table, and after an exchange of glances, the adventurers seated themselves. The Cimmerian was suspicious. His fierce blue eyes roved about the chamber, and he kept his sword close to his hand. But an invitation to eat and drink never found him backward. His eyes kept wandering to Tascela, but the princess had eyes only for his white-skinned companion.         *       *       *       *       *  Techotl, who had bound a strip of silk about his wounded thigh, placed himself at the table to attend to the wants of his friends, seeming to consider it a privilege and honor to see after their needs. He inspected the food and drink the others brought in gold vessels and dishes, and tasted each before he placed it before his guests. While they ate, Olmec sat in silence on his ivory seat, watching them from under his broad black brows. Tascela sat beside him, chin cupped in her hands and her elbows resting on her knees. Her dark, enigmatic eyes, burning with a mysterious light, never left Valeria's supple figure. Behind her seat a sullen handsome girl waved an ostrich-plume fan with a slow rhythm.  The food was fruit of an exotic kind unfamiliar to the wanderers, but very palatable, and the drink was a light crimson wine that carried a heady tang.  \"You have come from afar,\" said Olmec at last. \"I have read the books of our fathers. Aquilonia lies beyond the lands of the Stygians and the Shemites, beyond Argos and Zingara; and Cimmeria lies beyond Aquilonia.\"  \"We have each a roving foot,\" answered Conan carelessly.  \"How you won through the forest is a wonder to me,\" quoth Olmec. \"In bygone days a thousand fighting-men scarcely were able to carve a road through its perils.\"  \"We encountered a bench-legged monstrosity about the size of a mastodon,\" said Conan casually, holding out his wine goblet which Techotl filled with evident pleasure. \"But when we'd killed it we had no further trouble.\"  The wine vessel slipped from Techotl's hand to crash on the floor. His dusky skin went ashy. Olmec started to his feet, an image of stunned amazement, and a low gasp of awe or terror breathed up from the others. Some slipped to their knees as if their legs would not support them. Only Tascela seemed not to have heard. Conan glared about him bewilderedly.  \"What's the matter? What are you gaping about?\"  \"You--you slew the dragon-god?\"  \"God? I killed a dragon. Why not? It was trying to gobble us up.\"  \"But dragons are immortal!\" exclaimed Olmec. \"They slay each other, but no man ever killed a dragon! The thousand fighting-men of our ancestors who fought their way to Xuchotl could not prevail against them! Their swords broke like twigs against their scales!\"  \"If your ancestors had thought to dip their spears in the poisonous juice of Derketa's Apples,\" quoth Conan, with his mouth full, \"and jab them in the eyes or mouth or somewhere like that, they'd have seen that dragons are not more immortal than any other chunk of beef. The carcass lies at the edge of the trees, just within the forest. If you don't believe me, go and look for yourself.\"  Olmec shook his head, not in disbelief but in wonder.  \"It was because of the dragons that our ancestors took refuge in Xuchotl,\" said he. \"They dared not pass through the plain and plunge into the forest beyond. Scores of them were seized and devoured by the monsters before they could reach the city.\"  \"Then your ancestors didn't build Xuchotl?\" asked Valeria.  \"It was ancient when they first came into the land. How long it had stood here, not even its degenerate inhabitants knew.\"  \"Your people came from Lake Zuad?\" questioned Conan.  \"Aye. More than half a century ago a tribe of the Tlazitlans rebelled against the Stygian king, and, being defeated in battle, fled southward. For many weeks they wandered over grasslands, desert and hills, and at last they came into the great forest, a thousand fighting-men with their women and children.  \"It was in the forest that the dragons fell upon them, and tore many to pieces; so the people fled in a frenzy of fear before them, and at last came into the plain and saw the city of Xuchotl in the midst of it.  \"They camped before the city, not daring to leave the plain, for the night was made hideous with the noise of the battling monsters"]]]
