Remember that now. I will--never--forgive you--if you will--take that--from my hands.”  The cry for vengeance smote Macdonald to the heart, and recalled him to himself. He paused, threw back his locks from his eyes, then relaxing his grip, stood up.  “God preserve me!” he groaned, “what am I about?”  For some time he remained standing silent, with head down as if not quite sure of himself. He was recalled by a grip of his arm. He turned and saw his nephew, Ranald, at his side. The boy's dark face was pale with passion.  “And is that all you are going to do to him?” he demanded. Macdonald gazed at him.  “Do you not see what he has done?” he continued, pointing to his father, who was still lying propped up on some coats. “Why did you not break his back? You said you would! The brute, beast!”  He hurled out the words in hot hate. His voice pierced the noise of the room. Macdonald stood still, gazing at the fierce, dark face in solemn silence. Then he sadly shook his head.  “My lad, 'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord.' It would have pleased me well, but the hand of the Lord was laid upon me and I could not kill him.”  “Then it is myself will kill him,” he shrieked, springing like a wildcat at LeNoir. But his uncle wound his arms around him and held him fast. For a minute and more he struggled fiercely, crying to be set free, till recognizing the uselessness of his efforts he grew calm, and said quietly, “Let me loose, uncle; I will be quiet.” And his uncle set him free. The boy shook himself, and then standing up before LeNoir said, in a high, clear voice:  “Will you hear me, LeNoir? The day will come when I will do to you what you have done to my father, and if my father will die, then by the life of God [a common oath among the shanty-men] I will have your life for it.” His voice had an unearthly shrillness in it, and LeNoir shrank back.  “Whist, whist, lad! be quate!” said his uncle; “these are not goot words.” The lad heeded him not, but sank down beside his father on the floor. Black Hugh raised himself on his elbow with a grim smile on his face.  “It is a goot lad whatever, but please God he will not need to keep his word.” He laid his hand in a momentary caress upon his boy's shoulder, and sank back again, saying, “Take me out of this.”  Then Macdonald Bhain turned to Dan Murphy and gravely addressed him:  “Dan Murphy, it is an ungodly and cowardly work you have done this day, and the curse of God will be on you if you will not repent.” Then he turned away, and with Big Mack's help bore his brother to the pointer, followed by his men, bloody, bruised, but unconquered. But before he left the room LeNoir stepped forward, and offering his hand, said, “You mak friends wit' me. You de boss bully on de reever Hottawa.”  Macdonald neither answered nor looked his way, but passed out in grave silence.  Then Yankee Jim remarked to Dan Murphy, “I guess you'd better git them logs out purty mighty quick. We'll want the river in about two days.”  Dan Murphy said not a word, but when the Glengarry men wanted the river they found it open.  But for Macdonald the fight was not yet over, for as he sat beside his brother, listening to his groans, his men could see him wreathing his hands and chanting in an undertone the words, “Vengeance is mine saith the Lord.” And as he sat by the camp-fire that night listening to Yankee's account of the beginning of the trouble, and heard how his brother had kept himself in hand, and how at last he had been foully smitten, Macdonald's conflict deepened, and he rose up and cried aloud:  “God help me! Is this to go unpunished? I will seek him to-morrow.” And he passed out into the dark woods.  After a few moments the boy Ranald slipped away after him to beg that he might be allowed to go with him to-morrow. Stealing silently through the bushes he came to where he could see the kneeling figure of his uncle swaying up and down, and caught the sounds of words broken with groans:  “Let me go, O Lord! Let me go!” He pled now in Gaelic and again in English. “Let not the man be escaping his just punishment. Grant me this, O, Lord! Let me smite but once!” Then after a pause came the words, “'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord!' Vengeance is mine! Ay, it is the true word! But, Lord, let not this man of Belial, this Papish, escape!” Then again, like a refrain would come the words, “Vengeance is mine. Vengeance is mine,” in ever-deeper agony, till throwing himself on his face, he lay silent a long time.  Suddenly he rose to his knees and so remained, looking steadfastly before him into the woods. The wind came sighing through the pines with a wail and a sob. Macdonald shuddered and then fell on his face again. The Vision was upon him. “Ah, Lord, it is the bloody hands and feet I see. It is enough.” At this Ranald slipped back awe-stricken to the camp. When, after an hour, Macdonald came back into the firelight, his face was pale and wet, but calm, and there was an exalted look in his eyes. His men gazed at him with wonder and awe in their faces.  “Mercy on us! He will be seeing something,” said Big Mack to Yankee Jim.  “Seein' somethin'? What? A bar?” inquired Yankee.  “Whist now!” said Big Mack, in a low voice. “He has the sight. Be quate now, will you? He will be speaking.”  For a short time Macdonald sat gazing into the fire in silence, then turning his face toward the men who were waiting, he said: “There will be no more of this. 'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord!' It is not for me. The Lord will do His own work. It is the will of the Lord.” And the men knew that the last word had been said on that subject, and that LeNoir was safe.    CHAPTER III  THE MANSE IN THE BUSH   Straight north from the St. Lawrence runs the road through the Indian Lands. At first its way lies through open country, from which the forest has been driven far back to the horizon on either side, for along the great river these many years villages have clustered, with open fields about them stretching far away. But when once the road leaves the Front, with its towns and villages and open fields, and passes beyond Martintown and over the North Branch, it reaches a country where the forest is more a feature of the landscape. And when some dozen or more of the crossroads marking the concessions which lead off to east and west have been passed, the road seems to strike into a different world. The forest loses its conquered appearance, and dominates everything. There is forest everywhere. It lines up close and thick along the road, and here and there quite overshadows it. It crowds in upon the little farms and shuts them off from one another and from the world outside, and peers in through the little windows of the log houses looking so small and lonely, but so beautiful in their forest frames. At the nineteenth cross-road the forest gives ground a little, for here the road runs right past the new brick church, which is almost finished, and which will be opened in a few weeks. Beyond the cross, the road leads along the glebe, and about a quarter of a mile beyond the corner there opens upon it the big, heavy gate that the members of the Rev. Alexander Murray's congregation must swing when they wish to visit the manse. The opening of this gate, made of upright poles held by auger-holes in a frame of bigger poles, was almost too great a task for the minister's seven-year-old son Hughie, who always rode down, standing on the hind axle of the buggy, to open it for his father. It was a great relief to him when Long John Cameron, who had the knack of doing things for people's comfort, brought his ax and big auger one day and made a kind of cradle on the projecting end of the top bar, which he then weighted with heavy stones, so that the gate, when once the pin was pulled out of the post, would swing back itself with Hughie straddled on the top of it.  It was his favorite post of observation when waiting for his mother to come home from one of her many meetings. And on this particular March evening he had been waiting long and impatiently.  Suddenly he shouted: “Horo, mamma! Horo!” He had caught sight of the little black pony away up at the church hill, and had become so wildly excited that he was now standing on the top bar frantically waving his Scotch bonnet by the tails. Down the slope came the pony on the gallop, for she knew well that soon Lambert would have her saddle off, and that her nose would be deep into bran mash within five minutes more. But her rider sat her firmly and brought her down to a gentle trot by the time the gate was reached.  “Horo, mamma!” shouted Hughie, clambering down to open the gate.  “Well, my darling! have you been a good boy all afternoon?”  “Huh-huh! Guess who's come back from the shanties!”  “I'm sure I can't guess. Who is it?” It was a very bright and very sweet face, with large, serious, gray-brown eyes that looked down on the little boy.  “Guess, mamma!”  “Why, who can it be? Big Mack?”  “No!” Hughie danced delightedly. “Try again. He's not big.”  “I am sure I can never guess. Whoa, Pony!” Pony was most unwilling to get in close enough to the gate-post to let Hughie spring on behind his mother.  “You'll have to be quick, Hughie, when I get near again. There now! Whoa, Pony! Take care, child!”  Hughie had sprung clean off the post, and lighting on Pony's back just behind the saddle, had clutched his mother round the waist, while the pony started off full gallop for the stable.  “Now, mother, who is it?” insisted Hughie, as Lambert, the French-Canadian man-of-all-work, lifted him from his place.  “You'll have to tell me, Hughie!”  “Ranald!”  “Ranald?”  “Yes, Ranald and his father, Macdonald Dubh, and he's hurted awful bad, and--”  “Hurt, Hughie,” interposed the mother, gently.  “Huh"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],["title","The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#5)"],["body","-huh! Ranald said he was hurted.”  “Hurt, you mean, Hughie. Who was hurt? Ranald?”  “No; his father was hurted--hurt--awful bad. He was lying down in the sleigh, and Yankee Jim--”  “Mr. Latham, you mean, Hughie.”  “Huh-huh,” went on Hughie, breathlessly, “and Yankee--Mr. Latham asked if the minister was home, and I said 'No,' and then they went away.”  “What was the matter? Did you see them, Lambert?”  “Oui” (“Way,” Lambert pronounced it), “but dey not tell me what he's hurt.”  The minister's wife went toward the house, with a shadow on her face. She shared with her husband his people's sorrows. She knew even better than he the life-history of every family in the congregation. Macdonald Dubh had long been classed among the wild and careless in the community, and it weighed upon her heart that his life might be in danger.  “I shall see him to-morrow,” she said to herself.  For a few moments she stood on the doorstep looking at the glow in the sky over the dark forest, which on the west side came quite up to the house and barn.  “Look, Hughie, at the beautiful tints in the clouds, and see the dark shadows pointing out toward us from the bush.” Hughie glanced a moment.  “Mamma,” he said, “I am just dead for supper.”  “Oh, not quite, I hope, Hughie. But look, I want you to notice those clouds and the sky behind them. How lovely! Oh, how wonderful!”  Her enthusiasm caught the boy, and for a few moment she forgot even his hunger, and holding his mother's hand, gazed up at the western sky. It was a picture of rare beauty that lay stretched out from the manse back door. Close to the barn came the pasture-field dotted with huge stumps, then the brule where the trees lay fallen across one another, over which the fire had run, and then the solid wall of forest here and there overtopped by the lofty crest of a white pine. Into the forest in the west the sun was descending in gorgeous robes of glory. The treetops caught the yellow light, and gleamed like the golden spires of some great and fabled city.  “Oh, mamma, see that big pine top! Doesn't it look like windows?” cried Hughie, pointing to one of the lofty pine crests through which the sky quivered like molten gold.  “And the streets of the city are pure gold,” said the mother, softly.  “Yes, I know,” said Hughie, confidently, for to him all the scenes and stories of the Bible had long been familiar. “Is it like that, mamma?”  “Much better, ever so much better than you can think.”  “Oh, mamma, I'm just awful hungry!”  “Come away, then; so am I. What have you got, Jessie, for two very hungry people?”  “Porridge and pancakes,” said Jessie, the minister's “girl,” who not only ruled in the kitchen, but using the kitchen as a base, controlled the interior economy of the manse.  “Oh, goody!” yelled Hughie; “just what I like.” And from the plates of porridge and the piles of pancakes that vanished from his plate no one could doubt his word.  Their reading that night was about the city whose streets were of pure gold, and after a little talk, Hughie and his baby brother were tucked away safely for the night, and the mother sat down to her never-ending task of making and mending.  The minister was away at Presbytery meeting in Montreal, and for ten days his wife would stand in the breach. Of course the elders would take the meeting on the Sabbath day and on the Wednesday evening, but for all other ministerial duties when the minister was absent the congregation looked to the minister's wife. And soon it came that the sick and the sorrowing and the sin-burdened found in the minister's wife such help and comfort and guidance as made the absence of the minister seem no great trial after all. Eight years ago the minister had brought his wife from a home of gentle culture, from a life of intellectual and artistic pursuits, and from a circle of loving friends of which she was the pride and joy, to this home in the forest. There, isolated from all congenial companionship with her own kind, deprived of all the luxuries and of many of the comforts of her young days, and of the mental stimulus of that contact of minds without which few can maintain intellectual life, she gave herself without stint to her husband's people, with never a thought of self-pity or self-praise. By day and by night she labored for her husband and family and for her people, for she thought them hers. She taught the women how to adorn their rude homes, gathered them into Bible classes and sewing circles, where she read and talked and wrought and prayed with them till they grew to adore her as a saint, and to trust her as a leader and friend, and to be a little like her. And not the women only, but the men, too, loved and trusted her, and the big boys found it easier to talk to the minister's wife than to the minister or to any of his session. She made her own and her children's clothes, collars, hats, and caps, her husband's shirts and neckties, toiling late into the morning hours, and all without frown or shadow of complaint, and indeed without suspicion that any but the happiest lot was hers, or that she was, as her sisters said, “just buried alive in the backwoods.”  Not she! She lived to serve, and the where and how were not hers to determine. So, with bright face and brave heart, she met her days and faced the battle. And scores of women and men are living better and braver lives because they had her for their minister's wife.  But the day had been long, and the struggle with the March wind pulls hard upon the strength, and outside the pines were crooning softly, and gradually the brave head drooped till between the stitches she fell asleep. But not for many minutes, for a knock at the kitchen door startled her, and before long she heard Jessie's voice rise wrathful.  “Indeed, I'll do no such thing. This is no time to come to the minister's house.”  For answer there was a mumble of words.  “Well, then, you can just wait until morning. She can go in the morning.”  “What is it, Jessie?” The minister's wife came into the kitchen.  “Oh, Ranald, I'm glad to see you back. Hughie told me you had come. But your father is ill, he said. How is he?”  Ranald shook hands shyly, feeling much ashamed under Jessie's sharp reproof.  “Indeed, it was Aunt Kirsty that sent me,” said Ranald, apologetically.  “Then she ought to have known better,” said Jessie, sharply.  “Never mind, Jessie. Ranald, tell me about your father.”  “He is very bad indeed, and my aunt is afraid that--” The boy's lip trembled. Then he went on: “And she thought perhaps you might have some medicine, and--”  “But what is the matter, Ranald?”  “He was hurted bad--and he is not right wise in his head.”  “But how was he hurt?”  Ranald hesitated.  “I was not there--I am thinking it was something that struck him.”  “Ah, a tree! But where did the tree strike him?”  “Here,” pointing to his breast; “and it is sore in his breathing.”  “Well, Ranald, if you put the saddle on Pony, I shall be ready in a minute.”  Jessie was indignant.  “You will not stir a foot this night. You will send some medicine, and then you can go in the morning.”  But the minister's wife heeded her not.  “You are not walking, Ranald?”  “No, I have the colt.”  “Oh, that's splendid. We'll have a fine gallop--that is, if the moon is up.”  “Yes, it is just coming up,” said Ranald, hurrying away to the stable that he might escape Jessie's wrath and get the pony ready.  It was no unusual thing for the minister and his wife to be called upon to do duty for doctor and nurse. The doctor was twenty miles away. So Mrs. Murray got into her riding-habit, threw her knitted hood over her head, put some simple medicines into her hand-bag, and in ten minutes was waiting for Ranald at the door.    CHAPTER IV  THE RIDE FOR LIFE   The night was clear, with a touch of frost in the air, yet with the feeling in it of approaching spring. A dim light fell over the forest from the half-moon and the stars, and seemed to fill up the little clearing in which the manse stood, with a weird and mysterious radiance. Far away in the forest the long-drawn howl of a wolf rose and fell, and in a moment sharp and clear came an answer from the bush just at hand. Mrs. Murray dreaded the wolves, but she was no coward and scorned to show fear.  “The wolves are out, Ranald,” she said, carelessly, as Ranald came up with the pony.  “They are not many, I think,” answered the boy as carelessly; “but--are you--do you think--perhaps I could just take the medicine--and you will come--”  “Nonsense, Ranald! bring up the pony. Do you think I have lived all this time in Indian Lands to be afraid of a wolf?”  “Indeed, you are not afraid, I know that well!” Ranald shrank from laying the crime of being afraid at the door of the minister's wife, whose fearlessness was proverbial in the community; “but maybe--” The truth was, Ranald would rather be alone if the wolves came out.  But Mrs. Murray was in the saddle, and the pony was impatient to be off.  “We will go by the Camerons' clearing, and then take their wood track. It is a better road,” said Ranald, after they had got through the big gate.  “Now, Ranald, you think I am afraid of the swamp, and by the Camerons' is much longer.”  “Indeed, I hear them say that you are not afraid of the--of anything,”  said Ranald, quickly, “but this road is better for the horses.”  “Come on, then, with your colt”; and the pony darted away on her quick-springing gallop, followed by the colt going with a long, easy, loping stride. For a mile they kept side by side till they reached the Camerons' lane, when Ranald held in the colt and allowed the pony to lead. As they passed through the Camerons' yard the big black dogs, famous bear-hunters, came baying at them. The pony regarded them with indifference, but the colt shied and plunged.  “Whoa, Liz!” Liz was Ranald's contraction for Lizette, the name of the French horse-trainer and breeder, Jules La Rocque, gave to her mother, who in her day was queen of the ice at L'O"]]]
