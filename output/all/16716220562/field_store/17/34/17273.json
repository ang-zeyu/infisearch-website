How kum yer ter do sech a fool thing? A niggah dunno nuffin' nohow. 'Sides, yer can't do hit in one night. Co'se not. Takes two; mebbe three. I dunno.\"  \"Then why did you tell me about it if you didn't know?\" demanded Bee indignantly. \"You said that it would make me as fair as the lily of the valley. Now, I've just ruined my face. Oh oh, oh!\"  She began to cry weakly. Aunt Fanny smoothed her hair in an attempt at consolation.  \"I'se just a low-down niggah ter make yer cry so, Miss Bee,\" she said remorsefully. \"Dey does use jim'son in de Souf, but mebbe dey puts sompin elsen wid hit. Nebber you mind. Aunt Fanny'll fin' sumpin ter fix yer. Now go down ter yer pa. De brek'fus am gittin' cole, an' yer needs hit hot.\"  \"Go down?\" cried Bee in perturbation. \"I can't go down like this. You go, and tell father I'm sick. Tell him I can't come. Oh! tell him anything!\"  \"Beatrice,\" called her father at this moment from the foot of the stairs, \"is anything the matter? You were not at dinner last night. Are you ill that you don't come to breakfast?\"  \"I reckon yer shorely in fer hit, Miss Bee,\" spoke Aunt Fanny commiseratingly. \"If yer sick he's gwine ter kum up anyhow. De bes' thing is ter go right erlong, and get hit over wid. An' if he scolds hard yer won't nebber forgib me.\"  \"It is my own fault, Aunt Fanny,\" acknowledged the girl. \"I ought to have known better than to have done anything of the sort. Now I am in for it, as you say. Yes; I'll go down. Father can't dislike me any more than he does, so I might as well face him first as last.\" She rose as she spoke and went to the door: \"I am all right, father,\" she called. \"I'll be down in a minute.\"  It was more than a minute before she could pull herself together; then, summoning all her fortitude, she went slowly down the stairs to the dining room. Dr. Raymond turned at her entrance.  \"Good morn--\" he began in greeting, but stopped short as though he could not believe the evidence of his eyes. \"Beatrice Raymond, is that you?\" he demanded.  \"Yes,\" returned Beatrice as steadily as she could. \"It is I, father. Are you ready for your coffee?\"  \"What is the meaning of this?\" he asked sharply. \"What have you been doing to yourself?\"  Something came into Bee's throat and choked her. A moment passed before she could reply.  \"I have been trying to make myself beautiful, but it did not work well,\" she said at last in a low tone.  \"Beautiful!\" exclaimed Doctor Raymond in disgust. \"Is vanity also one of your weaknesses? I begin to believe that you are a bundle of them. Only a silly, vain girl would be guilty of such folly. I am sorely disappointed in you, Beatrice.\"  Again Bee choked so that she could not speak, and her eyes swam with tears. Had she so many follies? People used not to think she was such a dreadful girl. They used to be fond of her, but everything was going wrong lately. With hands that shook she silently poured her father's coffee and handed it to him.  \"How any girl,\" went on her father, seeing that she did not speak, \"how any girl should go deliberately to work to make such a fright of herself as you have done is beyond my comprehension. I suppose that all girls are more or less foolish about their complexions; but no girl of refinement should bleach her hair. It is an abomination to every self-respecting person. What caused you to do it?\"  Beatrice's heart was very full. She had done it for his sake, but she found it impossible to tell him. She had been content enough until he had come, and was dissatisfied with her. His words hurt her cruelly. Presently she found her voice:  \"I was trying to look like Adele,\" she told him tearfully.  \"You were?\" Struck by something in her tone the scientist glanced at her more closely. He saw that she was not eating anything, and that she was trembling. His manner softened. Bee was aware of the change instantly, and attributed it to the mention of her cousin. Her tears dried, and she was shaken with sudden anger.  \"Your cousin is a beautiful girl, Beatrice. She seems to be as lovely in disposition as in person. I do not at all wonder that you desire to be like her, but your manner of emulation has not been the most happy. Perhaps I spoke too severely. We are all prone to error, and I should not judge too harshly what, it seems, has been done from a worthy motive. If you wish to be like Adele, strive to copy her character rather than to imitate her outward appearance. Beauty of soul is the thing that counts. Before a sweet disposition and a well informed mind mere physical beauty palls.\"  \"That is not true,\" burst from Beatrice; \"and you know it.\"  \"Beatrice Raymond, do you know to whom you are speaking?\" The naturalist dropped his knife and fork, and stared at his daughter in amazement.  \"Yes, I do;\" answered Bee, wrought up to such a pitch that she forgot the respect and deference due her father. If the mere mention of her cousin's name had such influence upon him, she would let him know how she felt about it; so she continued wrathfully: \"You and Aunt Annie, and everybody, are fond of talking about the cultivation of the mind and spirit being above beauty, but you don't practice what you preach. Look at what you have been saying, and then think of how you have treated me.\"  \"Why, why,\" stammered Doctor Raymond, so surprised by this vehement outburst that he scarcely knew what to say.  \"You were away ten long, long years,\" went on Beatrice, almost beside herself with passion; all her pent-up unhappiness clamoring for utterance. \"I was just crazy for you to come home. Other girls had their fathers and I wanted mine too. When you wrote that you were coming I was happy; as happy as a bird. You had written that you wished my mind cultivated, and I studied hard to please you. I knew that you were a learned man, and I wanted to be able to talk to you intelligently. You wanted me to learn to be a good housekeeper, and that, too, I studied. I have tried to do everything that you wished me to. You say that you are disappointed in me. How do you think that I feel about you? You will have nothing to say to me because I am not Adele. You wanted her for your daughter, and you can't get over it because she isn't. In your last letter to me you said that you thought that I must have a mind of uncommon intelligence. Have I? You have not troubled to find out. What kind of a disposition have I? You don't know. And why? Just because I don't happen to be pretty. 'Sweet disposition and well informed mind' are all very well to talk about, but when it comes right down to real truth a girl might as well be dead if she isn't pretty.\"  \"You are giving me a terrible arraignment, Beatrice,\" observed her father gravely. \"Really, I--\"  \"Isn't it all true?\" demanded Bee with startling directness.  \"I think that probably some of it is,\" admitted Doctor Raymond guardedly. \"The discussion of beauty and non-beauty we will not prolong because we could come to no satisfactory conclusion on the matter. It is an old, old question. Beauty undoubtedly has its influence upon us all; chiefly, perhaps, because it at once attracts the attention. After all, it is but a free gift of nature accorded to its possessor by accident. It was not altogether Adele's beauty that caused me to claim her for my daughter.\"  \"But--\" began Beatrice.  \"Allow me the privilege of a word, my daughter. The unfortunate mistake of the picture is largely responsible for this whole affair. I naturally looked long and often at the photograph, supposing it to be yours. Seeing her standing in the doorway I recognized the girl whom I supposed was my daughter. Surely this explanation ought to excuse me, Beatrice?\"  \"But it was her picture that brought you home, father,\" wailed Bee miserably. \"You would never have come had it been really mine. Oh, that is what I can't bear!\"  \"I seem unfortunate in choosing my words also,\" said the scientist, stirring uneasily. \"The letters first caused me to think of returning.\"  \"But you would not have come if you had not believed that the beautiful picture was of your daughter,\" persisted Bee. \"I want the truth, father.\"  \"I am accustomed to speaking nothing else,\" answered Doctor Raymond sternly. \"All this is aside from the question.\"  \"Is it?\" asked the girl with some scorn. \"I think not; but you needn't answer, father. Explain your treatment of me after you found out your mistake. What effort have you made to find out what kind of a daughter you have? You hardly come near me. You were away for years, and now that you are home at last you are further from me than ever because I did have your letters; now I have nothing. I may be as brilliant as a diamond, or as simple as a daisy, but you don't care to take the trouble to find out.\"  \"Well, I have been exceedingly busy,\" replied he lamely. \"And you have not----You see--\" He did not wish to say that she had not presented a very inviting side of her character to him. Beatrice did not know this, so she did not wait for him to finish.  \"Yes, I see, father,\" she said wearily. She was beginning to feel very tired. The reaction of the unusual emotion was having its effect. \"You are just like everybody else. You talk of mind and disposition easily enough, but you succumb to beauty at first sight. At school it was the same. All of us were made to toe the mark except Adele. Nothing was ever expected of her but to be beautiful. I did not care until you came, and were disappointed in me. Then I tried protective mimicry, but it wasn't successful.\"  Doctor Raymond glanced up quickly.  \"What do you know about protective mimicry?\" he asked.  \"It's where one animal puts on the form of another animal to protect itself from enemies,\" answered Bee. \"I thought that if I could make myself like Adele you would come to care for me.\"  \"And was that what caused you to bleach your hair, and change your complexion?\"  \"Yes, father. You would not notice me, so "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33412"],["title","Observations on the Mississippi Kite in Southwestern Kansas (#0)"],["body","======================================================================                     UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS                        MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY                              -----------                      Volume 12, No. 11, pp. 503-519  -------------------------  October 25, 1963  -------------------------                        Observations on the Mississippi Kite                          in Southwestern Kansas                                      BY                              HENRY S.

FITCH   The Mississippi kite (_Ictinia mississippiensis_) is one of the common raptors of Kansas, occurring regularly and abundantly in summer in that part of the state south of the Arkansas River. In 1961, in an attempt to find out more about the ecology of the species in Kansas, I made several trips to parts of the state where kites could be found in numbers, notably to Meade County State Park in the southwestern part of the state, 7½ miles south and five miles west of Meade. Little has been written regarding the species in this extreme northwestern part of its breeding range, where it thrives under ecological conditions much different from those that prevail elsewhere in its range. Also, the social behavior and food habits have been given relatively little attention.  In my field study I was helped by my son, John H. Fitch, who climbed to many kite nests and spent many hours observing in the field. My daughter, Alice V. Fitch, likewise aided me by keeping nests under surveillance. Dr. Claude W. Hibbard of the University of Michigan and Mr. Harry Smith, superintendent of Meade State Park, also kindly provided much useful information concerning the history of the colony of Mississippi kites at the Park. Mr. William N. Berg analyzed pellets, and Dr. George W. Byers kindly checked many of the identifications, and provided generic and specific determinations for some of the insects.  In general, the range, habits and ecology of the Mississippi kite are already well known through the publications of Audubon (1840), Chapman (1891), Bendire (1892), Ganier (1902), Wayne (1910), Nice (1931), Bent (1936), Sutton (1939) and Eisenmann (1963). The breeding range is the southeastern United States, chiefly within the Austroriparian Life-zone, but extending northwest through much of Oklahoma and into southern Kansas. The species is highly migratory. Wintering Mississippi kites are known from Argentina and Paraguay (Eisenmann, _op. cit._:74), and most of the population probably winters in southern South America, but records outside the breeding range are few.  The Mississippi kite is perhaps one of the most social raptors. It is highly gregarious, not only in its migrations but in breeding colonies. All breeding pairs seen were closely associated with other individuals, with no territorial hostility; signs of intraspecific intolerance are rare, even where the kites are abundant. In the nesting season many of both sexes perch together in the same tree, and groups tend to keep together as they forage.  Secondary sexual differences are slight. Seven males in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History collection average 351 (342 to 360) millimeters in length, and six females average 361 (348 to 370) millimeters. Sutton (_op. cit._:44) collected 16 breeding kites near Arnett, Oklahoma in 1936 and 1937 and recorded that eleven males averaged 245 (216 to 269) grams and five females averaged 311 (278 to 339) grams. As indicated by Sutton, the head is paler in the adult male than in the female, and at close range this difference will serve for identification of the sexes. The difference in size is scarcely noticeable in the field.                                  Habitat  In Kansas this kite seems to prefer open and even barren terrain, in contrast with its habitat in forests of the southeastern states. Typical habitat of Kansas is that of the High Plains, dominated by a short-grass climax of blue grama (_Bouteloua gracilis_) and buffalo grass (_Buchloë dactyloides_), with sagebrush (_Artemisia_ sp.), prickly pear (_Opuntia_ sp.) and other somewhat xerophytic vegetation. In the Gypsum Hills of south-central Kansas near the Oklahoma border, the Mississippi kite finds habitat conditions exceptionally favorable. This is an area of broken topography, dissected by small steep-sided ravines, often with brush and scrubby trees on the slopes.  At Meade County State Park groves of cottonwoods (_Populus deltoides_) provided abundant places for perching and nesting. At this locality an artesian well provided an abundant year round water supply, which was impounded into an artificial lake half a mile long and a little less than a quarter mile wide. Water was also impounded in a series of small ponds maintained for the benefit of fish and waterfowl. Along with other improvements extensive plantings of cottonwoods and other trees were made with relief labor in the nineteen thirties. Trees were scarce on the area originally, but by 1961 there were almost continuous groves in an area nearly two miles long and three quarters of a mile wide encompassing the lake and ponds and adjacent areas. In conversation at the Park in August 1961, Dr. C. W. Hibbard told me of his observations on the colony of kites since 1936 when his paleontological field work in that area was begun. He indicated an area of less than two acres west of the artesian well to which the colony had been limited in its nesting in 1936, because at that time few trees were available as nest sites. In subsequent years, as the trees in the artificially established groves increased in size and height, and other trees became established naturally where the impoundments had created favorably moist conditions, the nesting colony expanded in all directions, and the number of kites increased tremendously. When my observations were made in 1961, the nesting area was co-extensive with the cottonwood groves, and there were literally thousands of trees within the area that provided adequate sites for nests.                                  Numbers  The maximum number of kites seen flying at one time at the Park was 44, on August 22, 1961. Probably almost all there were adults, because fledglings, even though able to fly strongly by this date, were still spending most of their time perched. The colony of kites was usually scattered over at least two square miles, and at most times some were perched, others were flying low and solitarily, hence it is improbable that the total population or a high percentage of it could be seen together at any one time or place. More than 40 nests were located in 1961, and probably at least as many more were overlooked. There must have been a breeding population of at least 100 kites, and probably as many as 150 in the Park in 1961. H. B. Tordoff recorded on the label of K. U. Mus. Nat. Hist. no. 30514, taken on September 1, 1951, in Barber County, Kansas, that it was one of at least 200 at a communal roost.                                  Feeding  The Park and its vicinity stood out as a veritable oasis in an almost treeless region of open rolling topography, with a short-grass type of vegetation dominating. The kites displayed versatility in their choice of places to forage. Often they soared over the cottonwood groves, the lake, or the ponds, but at other times they flew far out over the plains, and seemed to prefer such open situations. A small herd of buffalo was maintained at the Park, and their closely grazed pastures of several hundred acres were favorite foraging grounds for the kites. Often the kites and buffalo were seen in close association, and at times the kites must have benefited from the movements of the buffalo, serving to flush certain insects such as grasshoppers. The latter were probably the chief food source of the kites in the heavily grazed pastures. Bent (1936:67) stated: \"A flock of from 3 to 20 will sail about a person, a horseman or a team, traveling through grassy flats or bushy places, and seize the cicadas as they are scared up.\" Dr. Hibbard told me that on one occasion when he had caught a number of cicadas, he fed them to a pair of kites by tossing them into the air one by one, and each was seized by a kite which was flying nearby waiting expectantly.  Mississippi kites are noted for their buoyant and seemingly almost effortless flight, and their prey is caught while they are on the wing. In extended flights the kites soar, drift and circle with frequent easy flapping, at variable heights. Sometimes they are several hundred feet above the ground. Doubtless the height is influenced by the types of insects that are flying, and where they can be found most readily. Even at close range the catching of prey by a kite is likely to be overlooked by an observer. After being snatched from the air, the prey is usually eaten while the kite is still in flight, and the movements of the head in pecking at the objects held in the talons are much more noticeable than the slight veering from the course"]]]
