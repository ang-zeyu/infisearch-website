She was sensible of a feeling of relief; there was a gleam of hope.  If they did not know of her husband's presence--?  But the next word destroyed it.  \"We have not interfered with you up to the present time, but you have been harboring a spy here, and he is here now.\"  \"There is no spy here, and has never been,\" said Mrs. Stafford, with dignity.  \"But if there were, you should not know it from me.  It is not the custom of our people to deliver up those who have sought their protection.\"  She spoke with much spirit.  The officer removed his hat.  His keen eye was fixed on her white face. \"We shall search the premises,\" he said, still sternly, but more respectfully than he had yet spoken.  \"Major, have the house thoroughly searched.\"  The men went striding off, opening doors and looking through the rooms. The General took a turn up and down the hall.  He walked up to a door.  \"That is my chamber,\" said Mrs. Stafford, quickly.  The officer fell back.  \"It must be searched,\" he said.  \"My little children are asleep in there,\" said Mrs. Stafford, her face quite white.  \"It must be searched,\" repeated the General, more gently.  \"Either they must do it, or I.  You can take your choice.\"  Mrs. Stafford stood aside and made a gesture of assent.  She could not trust her voice.  He opened the door and stepped across the threshold. There he stopped.  His eye took in the scene.  Charlie was lying in the little trundle-bed in the corner, calm and peaceful, and by his side was Evelyn, her little face looking like a flower, lying in the tangle of golden hair which fell over her pillow.  The noise disturbed her slightly, for she smiled suddenly, and muttered something about \"Santa Tlaus\" and a \"dolly.\"  The officer's gaze swept the room, and fell on the overcrowded stockings hanging from the mantel.  He advanced to the fireplace and examined the doll and trousers closely.  With a curious expression on his face he leant over and gazed earnestly down at the two little heads on their pillow.  Then he turned and walked out of the room, closing the door softly behind him.  \"Major,\" he said to the officer in charge of the searching party, who descended the stairs just then, \"take the men back to camp, except the sentinels.  There is no spy here.\"  In a moment Mrs. Stafford came out of her chamber.  The old officer was walking up and down in deep thought.  Suddenly, as the last soldier disappeared through the door, he turned to her: \"Mrs. Stafford, be so kind as to go and tell Colonel Stafford that General Denby desires him to surrender himself.\"  Mrs. Stafford was struck dumb.  She was unable to move or to speak.  \"Kindly present my compliments and say he need not hurry; I shall wait for him,\" said the General, quietly, throwing himself into an arm-chair, and looking steadily into the fire.     VII  BOB SECURES A UNIFORM  As his father concealed himself, Bob had left the chamber.  He was in a perfect agony of mind.  He knew that his father could not escape, and if he were found dressed in citizen's clothes he felt that he could have but one fate.  Once the men went toward the passage that led through to the rear entry in which his father was concealed.  Bob's heart stood still; but he acted quickly.  He flung himself on the floor right in the entrance and began to work quietly by the dim firelight. The searchers passed by.  All sorts of schemes for rescue entered his head.  Suddenly he thought of a small group of prisoners he had seen pass by about dark.  He had talked with one of them, a major.  A guard said they were on their way to General Denby's camp.  He would save him!  Putting on his hat, he opened the front door and slipped out.  A sentinel tramping up and down on the porch accosted him surlily to know where he was going.  \"Won't you come in and get warm?\" said Bob, hospitably.  \"Can't.  Wish I could.  It's cold enough out here.  Cold as th' State of Maine.  I wish I was in old York right now by a good stove.\"  \"I wish you were, too,\" said Bob, with sincerity.  \"I'd give a mite to see that old white steeple again, and the moonlight on the snow stretching down toward the mill-pond; and hear the tide ripping in.\"  \"What do you do with your prisoners when you catch them?\" inquired Bob.  \"Send some on to prison--and hang some.\"  \"I mean when you first catch them.\"  \"Oh, they stay in camp.  We don't treat 'em bad, without they be spies. There's a batch at camp now, got in this evening--sort o' Christmas-gift.\"  The soldier laughed as he stamped his feet to keep warm.  \"Where's your camp?\" Bob asked.  \"About a mile from here, right on the road, or rather right on the hill at the edge o' the pines 'yond the crick.\"  The boy left him, and sauntered in and out among the other men who were building a fire in the yard.  Presently he moved on to the edge of the lawn beyond them.  No one took further notice of him.  In a second he had slipped through the gate, and was flying across the field.  He knew every foot of the ground as well as a hare, for he had been hunting and setting traps over it since he was as big as little Charlie.  He had to make a detour at the creek to avoid the picket at the bridge, and the dense briers in the bottom were very bad and painful.  However, he worked his way through, though his face and hands were severely scratched.  Into the creek he plunged.  \"Outch!\"  He had stepped into a hole up to his waist, and the water was as cold as ice.  However, he was soon through, and at the top of the hill he could see the glow of the camp-fires lighting up the sky.  He crept up cautiously, and saw the dark forms of the sentinels pacing backward and forward wrapped in their overcoats, now lit up by the fire, then growing black against its blazing embers, then lit up again, and passing away into the shadow.  How could he ever get by them?  His heart began to beat and his teeth to chatter, but he walked boldly up.  \"Halt! who goes there?\" cried the sentry, bringing his gun down and advancing on him.  Bob kept on, and the sentinel, finding that it was only a boy, looked rather sheepish.  To the men about the camp-fire his appearance was the signal for fun.  \"Don't let him capture you, Jim,\" called one of them; \"Call the Corporal of the Guard,\" another; \"Order up the reserves,\" a third. \"He's a Christmas-gift for you; I'm going to put him in your stocking,\" laughed one.  \"It's big enough to hold him,\" said another.  Bob had to undergo something of an examination.  Where had he come from?  \"I know the little Johnny,\" said one of the men.  \"He lives over in the white house on the hill to that side of the creek.\"  They told Bob to draw up to the fire, and made quite a fuss over him. Bob had his wits about him and soon learned that a batch of prisoners were at a fire a hundred yards farther back.  He therefore made his way over there, although he was advised to stay where he was and get dry, and had many offers of a bunk from his new friends, some of whom followed him over to where the prisoners were.  Most of the prisoners were quartered for the night in a hut before which a guard was stationed.  One or two, however, sat around the camp-fire, chatting with their guards.  Among these was a major in full uniform.  Bob singled him out: he was just about his father's size.  Bob was instantly the centre of attraction.  Again he told them he was from Holly Hill; again he was recognized by one of the men.  \"Run away to join the army?\" asked one.  \"No,\" said Bob, his eyes flashing at the suggestion.  \"Lost?\"  \"No.\"  \"Mother whipped you?\"  \"No.\"  As soon as their curiosity had somewhat subsided, Bob, who had hardly been able to contain himself, said to the Confederate major in a low undertone:  \"My father, Colonel Stafford, is at home, concealed, and the Yankees have taken possession of the house.\"  \"Well?\" said the Major, looking down at him as if casually.  \"He cannot escape.  He came to-night through the lines, and he has on citizen's clothes, and--\"  Bob's voice choked suddenly as he gazed at the Major's uniform.  \"Well?\"  The prisoner for a second looked sharply down at the boy's earnest face.  Then he put his hand under his chin, and lifting it, looked into his eyes.  Bob shivered and a sob escaped him.  The Major placed his hand firmly on his knee.  \"Why, you are wringing wet,\" he said, aloud.  \"I wonder you are not frozen to death.\"  He rose and stripped off his coat.  \"Here, get into this;\" and before the boy knew it the Major had bundled him into his coat, and rolled up the sleeves so that Bob could use his hands.  The action attracted the attention of the rest of the group, and several of the soldiers offered to take the boy and give him dry clothes.  \"No, sir,\" laughed the Major; \"this boy is a rebel.  Do you think he will wear one of your Yankee suits?  He's a little major, and I'm going to give him a major's uniform.\"  In a minute he had stripped off his trousers, and was helping Bob into them, standing himself in his underclothes in the icy air.  The legs were twice too long for the boy, and the waist came up to his arm-pits.  \"Now go home to your mother,\" said the Major, laughing at his appearance; \"and some of you fellows get me some clothes or a blanket. I'll wear your Yankee uniform out of sheer necessity.\"  Bob trotted around, keeping as far away from the light of the camp-fires as possible.  He soon found himself unobserved, and reaching the shadow of a line of huts, and keeping well in it, he came to the edge of the camp.  He watched his opportunity, and when the sentry's back was turned he slipped out into the darkness.  In an instant he was flying down the hill.  The heavy clothes impeded him, and he stopped only long enough to snatch them off and roll them into a bundle, and sped on his way again.  He struck the main road, and was running down it as fast as his legs could carry him, when he suddenly found himself almost on a group of dark objects who were standing in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33666"],["title","A Captured Santa Claus (#5)"],["body","just in front of him.  One of them moved.  It was the picket.  He had forgotten all about them.  Bob suddenly stopped.  His heart was in his throat.  [Illustration: Bob trotted around, keeping as far away from the light of the camp-fires as possible.]  \"Who goes there?\" said a stern voice.  Bob's heart beat as if it would spring out of his body.  \"Come in; we have you,\" said the man, advancing.  Bob sprang across the ditch beside the road, and putting his hand on the top rail of the low fence, flung himself over it, bundle and all, flat on the other side, just as a blaze of light burst from the picket, and the report of a carbine startled the silent night.  The bullet grazed the boy's arm, and crashed through the rail.  In a second Bob was on his feet.  The picket was almost on him.  Seizing his bundle, he dived into the thicket as a half-dozen shots were sent ringing after him, the bullets hissing and whistling over his head.  Several men dashed into the woods after him in hot pursuit, and a couple more galloped up the road to intercept him; but Bob's feet were winged, and he slipped through briers and brush like a scared hare.  They scratched his face and threw him down, but he was up again.  Now and then a shot crashed behind him, but he did not care for that; he thought only of being caught.  A few hundred yards up the stream he plunged into the water, and wading across, was soon safe from his pursuers.  Breathless, he climbed the hill, made his way through the woods, and emerged into the open fields. Across these he sped like a deer.  He had almost given out.  What if they should have caught his father, and he should be too late!  A sob escaped him at the bare thought, and he broke again into a fast run, wiping off with his sleeve the tears that would come.  The wind cut him like a knife, but he did not mind that.  As he neared the house he feared that he might be stopped again and the clothes taken from him, so he paused for a moment, and slipped them on once more, rolling up the sleeves and legs as well as he could.  He crossed the yard undisturbed.  He went around to the same door by which he had come out, for he thought this his best chance.  The same sentinel was there, walking up and down, blowing his cold hands.  Had his father been arrested?  Bob's teeth chattered, but it was with suppressed excitement.  \"Your clothes seem to 'a' grown a mite since you went out?\" said the sentry, quizzically.  \"Yes, I was co-co-cold,\" stammered Bob.  \"'Tis pretty cold,\" said the sentry.  \"Ye--es,\" gasped Bob.  \"Your mother's been out here, looking for you, I guess,\" said the soldier, with much friendliness.  \"I rec--reckon so,\" panted Bob, moving toward the door.  Did that mean that his father was caught?  He opened the door, and slipped quietly into the corridor.  General Denby still sat silent before the hall-fire.  Bob listened at the chamber-door.  His mother was weeping; his father stood calm and resolute before the fire.  He had determined to give himself up.  \"If you only did not have on those clothes!\" sobbed Mrs. Stafford.  \"If I only had not cut up the old uniform for the children!\"  \"Mother! mother!  I have one!\" gasped Bob, bursting into the room and tearing off the unknown major's uniform.     VIII  SANTA CLAUS SURRENDERS  Ten minutes later Colonel Stafford, with a steady step and a proud carriage, and with his hand resting on Bob's shoulder, walked out into the hall.  He was dressed in the uniform of a Confederate major, which fitted admirably his tall, erect figure.  \"General Denby, I believe,\" he said, as the Union officer rose and faced him.  \"We have met before under somewhat different circumstances,\" he said, with a bow, \"for I now find myself your prisoner.\"  \"I have the honor to request your parole,\" said the General, with great politeness, \"and to express the hope that I may be able in some way to return the courtesy which I formerly received at your hands.\"  He extended his hand and Colonel Stafford took it.  \"You have my parole,\" said he.  \"I was not aware,\" said the General, with a bow toward Mrs. Stafford, \"until I entered the room where your children were sleeping, that I had the honor of your husband's acquaintance.  I will now take my leave and return to my camp, that I may not by my presence interfere with the joy of this season.\"  \"I desire to introduce to you my son,\" said Colonel Stafford, proudly presenting Bob.  \"He is a hero.\"  The General bowed as he shook hands with him.  Perhaps he had some suspicion how true a hero he was, for he rested his hand kindly on the boy's head, but said nothing.  Both Colonel and Mrs. Stafford invited the old soldier to spend the night there, but he declined.  He, however, accepted an invitation to dine with them next day.  Before leaving, he requested permission to take one more look at the sleeping children.  Over Evelyn he bent silently.  Suddenly stooping, he kissed her little pink cheek, and with a scarcely audible \"Good-night,\" passed quickly out of the room and left the house.   The next morning, by light, there was great rejoicing.  Charlie and Evelyn were up betimes, and were laughing and chattering over their presents like two little magpies.  \"Those Yankees did not catch Santa Claus at all.  Here's my sword and here's my breeches,\" cried Charlie, \"two pair; but I'm goin' to put on my gray ones.  I ain't goin' to wear a blue uniform.\"  \"Here's my dolly!\" screamed Evelyn, in an ecstasy over her beautiful present.  Just then their father sat up and spoke to them.  With a cry they gathered up their presents and made a dash for him.  \"Just see what Santa Claus brought us,\" they cried, hugging him warmly.  \"How did you tum?\" asked Evelyn, in a pause.  \"Oh, don't you know 't Santa Claus brought him to mamma?\" said Charlie, arrogantly.  \"Papa, did he let you drive the reindeer?\"  Presently Bob and Ran burst in, their eyes fairly dancing.  \"Christmas-gift!  It's a real one--real gold!\" cried Bob, holding up a small gold watch, while Ran was shouting over a silver watch of the same size.   That evening, after dinner, General Denby was sitting by the fire in the Holly Hill parlor, with Evelyn nestled in his lap, her dolly clasped close to her bosom, and, in the absence of Colonel Stafford, who had walked out, with the older boys, the General told Mrs. Stafford the story of the opening of the package by the camp-fire.  The tears welled up in Mrs. Stafford's eyes and ran down her cheeks.  Charlie suddenly entered, in all the majesty of his new breeches, and sword buckled on hip.  He saw his mother's tears.  His little face flushed.  In a second his sword was out, and he struck a hostile attitude.  \"You sha'n't make my mamma cry!\" he shouted.  \"Charlie!  Charlie!\" cried Mrs. Stafford, hastening to stop him.  \"My papa said I was not to let anyone make you cry,\" insisted the boy, stepping before his mother, and still keeping his angry eyes on the General.  \"Oh, Charlie!\" Mrs. Stafford took hold of him.  \"I am ashamed of you!--to be so rude!\"  \"Let him alone, madam,\" said the General.  \"It is not rudeness; it is spirit--the spirit of our race.  He has the soldier's blood, and some day he will be a soldier himself, and a brave one.  I shall count on him for the Union,\" he said, with a smile.  Mrs. Stafford shook her head.  But the General nodded again, and, drawing the little boy to his knees, told him of his father's showing him the sword by the camp-fire when he himself was a prisoner.  A few days later, Colonel Stafford, in accordance with an understanding, went over to General Denby's camp, and reported to be sent on to Washington as a prisoner of war.  The General was absent on the lines at the time, but was expected soon, and the Colonel waited for him at his head-quarters.  There had been many tears shed when his wife bade him good-by.  About an hour after the Colonel left home, the General and his staff were riding back to camp along the road which ran by the Holly Hill gate.  Just before they reached it, two little figures came out of the gate and started down the road.  One was a boy of five, who carried a toy sword, drawn, in one hand, whilst with the other he led his companion, a little girl of three, who clasped a large yellow-haired doll to her breast.  The soldiers cantered forward and overtook them.  The little girl shrank behind her brother where he stood, stoutly, holding her behind him with one hand while with the other he clutched his small sword, defiantly.  \"Where are you going, my little people?\" inquired the General, reining in and gazing down at them affectionately.  \"I'm goin' to get my papa,\" said the tiny swordsman, firmly, turning a sturdy and determined little face up to him.  \"My mamma's cryin', an' I'm goin' to take my papa home.  I ain' goin' to let the Yankees have him.\"  [Illustration: \"I'm goin' to get my papa,\" said the tiny swordsman.]  The officers all broke into a murmur of mingled admiration and amusement.  \"No, we ain' goin' let the Yankees have our papa,\" chimed in Evelyn, pushing her tangled hair out of her eyes, and keeping fast hold of Charlie's hand for fear of the horses around her.  The General dismounted.  \"How are you going to help, my little Semiramis?\" he asked, stooping over her, with smiling eyes.  \"I'm goin' to give 'em my dolly if they will give me my papa,\" she said, gravely, as if she understood the equality of the exchange.  \"Suppose you give a kiss instead?\"  There was a second of hesitation, and then she put up her little face, and the old General dropped on one knee in the road and lifted her in his arms, doll and all.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said to his staff, \"you behold the future defenders of the Union.\"  The little ones were coaxed home, Charlie in front of a staff-officer, and Evelyn in front of General Denby himself.  And that afternoon, as Colonel Stafford was expecting to leave the camp for Washington with a lot of prisoners, a despatch was brought in to General Denby, who smiled as he "]]]
