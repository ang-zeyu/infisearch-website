The luminescent and combustible, almost wax-like substance impressed him greatly. \"My thoughts about the unexpected generation of light and fire out of water, fine earth, and phlogiston I reserve to describe at a later time.\" These thoughts went so far as to connect the new marvel with alchemical wonder tales. When Marggraf used the \"essential salt of urine,\" also called _sal microcosmicum_, and admixed silver chloride (\"horny silver\") to it for the distillation of phosphorus, he expected \"a partial conversion of silver by phlogiston and the added fine vitrifiable earth, but no trace of a more noble metal appeared.\"[8]  Robert Boyle had already found that the burning of phosphorus produced an acid. He identified it by taste and by its influence on colored plant extracts serving as \"indicators.\" Hankwitz[9] described methods for obtaining this acid, and Marggraf showed its chemical peculiarities. They did not necessarily establish phosphorus as a new element. To do that was not as important, at that time, as to conjecture on analogies with known substances. Underlying all its unique characteristics was the analogy of phosphorus with sulfur. Like sulfur, phosphorus can burn in two different ways, either slowly or more violently, and form two different acids. The analogy can, therefore, be extended to explain the results in both groups in the same way. In the process of burning, the combustible component is removed, and the acid originally combined with the combustible is set free. Whether the analogy should be pursued even further remained doubtful, although some suspicion lingered on for a while that phosphoric acid might actually be a modified sulfuric acid. Analogies and suspicions like these were needed to formulate new questions and stimulate new experiments. They are cited here for their important positive value in the historical development, and not for the purpose of showing how wrong these chemists were from our point of view, a point of view which they helped to create.  The widespread interest in the burning of sulfur and of phosphorus, naturally, caught Lavoisier's attention. In his first volume of _Opuscules Physiques et Chimiques_ (1774), he devoted 20 pages to his experiments on phosphorus. He amplified them a few years later[10] when he attributed the combustion to a combination of phosphorus with the \"eminently respirable\" part of air. In the _Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique_ of 1787, the column of \"undecomposed substances\" lists sulfur as the \"radical sulfurique,\" and phosphorus, correspondingly, as the \"radical phosphorique.\" The acids are now shown to be compounds of the \"undecomposed\" radicals, the complete reversion of the previous concept of this relationship. A part of the old analogy remained as far as the acids are concerned: sulfuric acid corresponds to phosphoric; sulfurous acid to phosphorous acid with less oxygen than in the former.[11]     Early Uses   In the 18th century, phosphorus was a costly material. It was produced mostly for display and to satisfy curiosity. Guillaume François Rouelle (1703-1770) demonstrated the process in his lectures, and, as Macquer reports, he \"very often\" succeeded in making it.[12] Robert Boyle had the idea of using phosphorus as a light for underwater divers.[13] A century later, \"instant lights\" were sold, with molten phosphorus as the \"igniter,\" but they proved cumbersome and unreliable.[14] Because white phosphorus is highly poisonous, an active development of the use in matches occurred only after the conversion of the white modification into the red had been studied by Émile Kopp (1844), by Wilhelm Hittorf (1824-1914) and, in its practical application, by Anton Schrötter (1802-1875).[15]  [Illustration: Figure 3.--DISTILLATION APPARATUS (1849) for refining crude phosphorus. The crude phosphorus is mixed with sand under hot water, cooled, drained, and filled into the retort. The outlet of the retort, at least 6 cm. in diameter, is partially immersed in the water contained in the bucket. A small dish, made from lead, with an iron handle, receives the distilled phosphorus. (From HUGO FLECK, _Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte ..._ page 90.)]  The most exciting early use, however, was in medicine. It is not surprising that such a use was sought at that time. Any new material immediately became the hope of ailing mankind--and of striving inventors.[16] Phosphorus was prescribed, in liniments with fatty oils or as solution in alcohol and ether, for external and internal application. A certain Dr. Kramer found it efficient against epilepsy and melancholia (1730). A Professor Hartmann recommended it against cramps.[17] However, in the growing production of phosphorus for matches, the workers experienced the poisonous effects. In the plant of Black and Bell at Stratford, this was prevented by inhaling turpentine. Experiments on dogs were carried out to show that poisoning by phosphorus could be remedied through oil of turpentine.[18]  [Illustration: Figure 4.--APPARATUS FOR CONVERTING WHITE PHOSPHORUS into the red allotropic form, 1851. Redistilled phosphorus is heated in the glass or porcelain vessel (g) which is surrounded by a sandbath (e) and a metal bath (b). Vessel (j) is filled with mercury and water; together with valve (k), it serves as a safety device. The alcohol lamp (l) keeps the tube warm against clogging by solidified vapors. Because of hydrogen phosphides, the operation, carried out at 260° C., had to be watched very carefully. (According to Arthur Albright, 1851; reproduced from HUGO FLECK, _Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte ..._, page 112.)]     Chemical Constitution of Phosphoric Acids   In a long article on phosphorus, Edmond Willm wrote in 1876: \"For a century, urine was the only source from which phosphorus was obtained. After Gahn, in 1769, recognized the presence of phosphoric acid in bones, Scheele indicated the procedure for making phosphorus from them.\"[19] Actually, Gahn used at first hartshorn (_Cornu cervi ustum_), and Scheele doubted, until he checked it himself, that his esteemed friend was right. A few years later, Scheele corrected Gahn's assumption that the _sal microcosmicum_ was an ammonia salt; instead, it is \"a tertiary neutral salt, consisting of _alkali minerali fixo_ (i.e., sodium), _alkali volatili_, and _acido phosphori_.\"[20]  In the years after 1770, phosphorus was discovered in bones and many other parts of various animals. Treatment with sulfuric acid decomposed these materials into a solid residue and dissolved phosphoric acid. Many salts of this acid were produced in crystalline form. Heat resistance had been considered one of the outstanding characteristics of phosphoric acid. Now, however, in the processes of drying and heating certain phosphates, it became clear that three kinds of phosphoric acids could be produced: _ortho_, _pyro_, and _meta_.  Berzelius cited these acids as examples of compounds which are ISOMERIC. This word was intended to designate compounds which contain the same number of atoms of the same elements but combined in different manners, thereby explaining their different chemical properties and crystal forms. It was in 1830 that Berzelius propounded this companion of the concept, ISOMORPHISM, which was to collect all cases of equal crystal form in compounds in which equal numbers of atoms of different elements are put together in the same manner. Together, the two concepts of isomerism and isomorphism seemed to cover all the known exceptions from the simplest assumption as to specificity and chemical composition.  However, only a few years later Thomas Graham (1805-1869) proved that the three phosphoric acids are not isomeric. He used the proportion of 2 P to 5 O in the oxide which Berzelius had thought justified at least until \"an example of the contrary could be sufficiently established.\"[21] Refining the techniques of Gay-Lussac (1816) and several other investigators, Graham characterized the three phosphoric acids as \"a terphosphate, a biphosphate, and phosphate of water.\" Actually, this was the wrong terminology for what he meant and formulated as trihydrate, bihydrate, and monohydrate of phosphorus oxide. In his manner of writing the formulas, each dot over the symbol for the element was to indicate an atom of oxygen; thus, he wrote:      ...   :: ..   ...    . .     H^{3} P  H^{2} P and H P.[22]  [Illustration: Figure 5.--OVEN FOR THE CALCINATION OF BONES, about 1870. \"The operation is carried out in a rather high oven, such as shown.... The fresh bones are thrown in at the top of the oven, B. First, fuel in chamber F is lighted, and a certain quantity of bones is burnt on the grid D. When these bones are burning well, the oven is gradually filled with bones, and the combustion maintains itself without addition of other fuel. A circular gallery, C, surrounds the bottom of the oven and carries the products of combustion into the chimney, H. The calcined bones are taken out at the lower opening, G, by removing the bars of grid B.\" (Translation of the description from FIGUIER, _Merveilles de l'industrie_, volume 3, 1874, page 537.)]  [Illustration: Figure 6.--AN ADVERTISEMENT with view of plant for manufacturing superphosphate about 1867. (From E. T. FREEDLEY, _Philadelphia and its Manufacturers in 1867_, page 288.)]  Graham had come to this understanding of the phosphoric acids through his previous studies of \"Alcoates, definite compounds of Salts and Alcohol analogous to the Hydrates\" (1831). Liebig started from analogies he saw with certain organic acids when he formulated the phosphoric acids with a constant proportion of water (aq.) and varying proportions of \"phosphoric acid\" (P) as follows:      2 P 3 aq.  phosphoric acid     3 P 3 aq.  pyrophosphoric acid    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33766"],["title","History of Phosphorus (#2)"],["body"," 6 P 3 aq.  metaphosphoric acid.  [Illustration: Figure 7.--FLORIDA HARD-ROCK PHOSPHATE MINING. (From Carroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States_, sixth special report of the Commissioner of Labor, Government Printing Office, Washington, 1893, plate facing page 43.)]  Salts are formed when a \"basis,\" i.e., a metal oxide, replaces water. When potassium-acid sulfate is neutralized by sodium base, the acid-salt divides into Glauber's salt and potassium sulfate, which proves the acid-salt to be a mixture of the neutral salt with its acid. Sodium-acid phosphate behaves quite differently. After neutralization by a potassium \"base\" (hydroxide), the salt does not split up; a uniform sodium-potassium phosphate is obtained. Therefore, phosphoric acid is truly three-basic![23]  This result has later been confirmed, but the analogy by means of which it had been obtained was very weak, in certain parts quite wrong.  The acids from the two lower oxides of phosphorus were also considered as three-basic. Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) formulated them in 1846, according to the theory of chemical types:      (PO)···             O^{3}  phosphoric acid       H^{3}      (PHO)··             O^{2}  phosphorus acid        H^{2}      (PH^{2}O)·                O   hypophosphorous acid.[24]            H  Further proof for these constitutions was sought in the study of the esters formed when the acids react with alcohols.  Among the analogies and generalizations by which the research on phosphoric acid was supported, and to the results of which it contributed a full share, was the new theory of acids. Not oxygen, Lavoisier's general acidifier, but reactive hydrogen determines the character of acids. In this brief survey, it seems sufficient just to mention this connection without describing it in detail.  The study of phosphoric acids led to important new concepts in theoretical chemistry. The finding of polybasicity was extended to other acids and formed the model that helped to recognize the polyfunctionality in other compounds, like alcohols and amines. The hydrogen theory of acids was fundamental for further advance. In another dimension, it is particularly interesting to see that large-scale applications followed almost immediately and directly from the new theoretical insight. The first and foremost of these applications was in agriculture.     Phosphates as Plant Nutrients   One hundred years after the discovery of \"cold light,\" the presence of phosphorus in plants and animals was ascertained, and its form was established as a compound of phosphoric acid. This knowledge had little practical effect until the \"nature\" of the acid, in its various forms, was explained through the work of Thomas Graham. From it, there started a considerable technical development.  At about that time (1833), the Duke of Richmond proved that the fertilizing value of bones resided not in the gelatin, nor in the calcium, but in the phosphoric acid. Thus, he confirmed what Théodore de Saussure had said in 1804, that \"we have no reason to believe\" that plants can exist without phosphorus. Unknowingly at first, the farmer had supplied this element by means of the organic fertilizers he used: manure, excrements, bones, and horns. Now, with the value of phosphorus known, a search began for mineral phosphates to be applied as fertilizers. Jean Baptiste Boussingault (1802-1887), an agricultural chemist in Lyons, traveled to Peru to see the guano deposits. Garcilaso de la Vega (ca. 1540 to ca. 1616) noted in his history of Peru (1604) that guano was used by the Incas as a fertilizer. Two hundred years later, Alexander von Humboldt revived this knowledge, and Humphry Davy wrote about the benefits of guano to the soil. Yet, the application of this fertilizer developed only slowly, until Justus Liebig sang its praise. Imports into England rose and far exceeded those into France where, between 1857 and 1867, about 50,000 tons were annually received.  The other great advance in the use of phosphatic plant nutrients started with Liebig's recommendation (1840) to treat bones with sulfuric acid for solubilization. This idea was not entirely new; since 1832, a production of a \"superphosphate\" from bones and sulfuric acid had been in progress at Prague. At Rothamsted in 1842, John Bennet Lawes obtained a patent on the manufacture of superphosphate. Other manufactures in England followed and were successful, although James Muspratt (1793-1886) at Newton lost much time and \"some thousands of pounds\" on Liebig's idea of a \"mineral manure.\"  [Illustration: Figure 8.--FLORIDA LAND-PEBBLE PHOSPHATE MINING. (From Carroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States ..._, plate facing page 58.)]  It was difficult enough to establish the efficacy of bones and artificially produced phosphates in promoting the growth of plants under special conditions of soils and climate; therefore, the question as to the action of phosphates in the growing plant was not even seriously formulated at that time. The beneficial effects were obvious enough to increase the use of phosphates as plant nutrients and to call for new sources of supply. Active developments of phosphate mining and treating started in South Carolina in 1867, and in Florida in 1888.[25]  In a reciprocal action, more phosphate application to soils stimulated increasing research on the conditions and reactions obtaining in the complex and varying compositions called soil. The findings of bacteriologists made it clear that physics and chemistry had to be amplified by biology for a real understanding of fertilizer effects. After 1900, for example, Julius Stoklasa (1857-1936) pointed out that bacterial action in soil solubilizes water-insoluble phosphates and makes them available to the plants.[26]  [Illustration: Figure 9.--FLORIDA RIVER-PEBBLE PHOSPHATE MINING. (From Carroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States ..._, plate facing page 64.)]  The insight into the importance of phosphorus in organisms, especially since Liebig's time, is reflected in the work of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). This \"re-valuator of all values\" who modestly said of himself: \"I am dynamite!\" once explained the human temperaments as caused by the inorganic salts they contain: \"The differences in temperament are perhaps caused more by the different distribution and quantities of the inorganic salts than by everything else. Bilious people have too little sodium sulfate, the melancholics are lacking in potassium sulfate and phosphate; too little calcium phosphate in the phlegmatics. Courageous natures have an excess of iron phosphate.\" (See volume 12 of _Nietzsche's Works_, edit. Naumann-Kröner, Leipzig, 1886.) In this strange association of inorganic salts with human temperaments, the role of iron phosphate as a producer of courage is particularly interesting. What would a modern philosopher conclude if he followed the development of insight into the composition and function of complex phosphate compounds in organisms?     From Inorganic to Organic Phosphates   By the middle of the 19th century, the source of phosphorus in natural phosphates and the chemistry of its oxidation products had been established. The main difficulty that had to be overcome was that these oxidation products existed in so many forms, not only several stages of oxidation, but, in addition, aggregations and condensations of the phosphoric acids. Once the fundamental chemistry of these acids was elucidated, the attention of chemists and physiologists turned to the task of finding the actual state in which phosphorus compounds were present in the organisms. It had been a great advance when it had been shown that plants need phosphates in their soil. This led to the next question concerning the materials in the body of the plant for which phosphates were being used and into which they were incorporated. Similarly, the knowledge that animals attain their phosphates from the digested plant food called, in the next step of scientific inquiry, for information on the nature of phosphates produced from this source.  The method used in this inquiry was to subject anatomically separated parts of the organisms to chemical separations. The means for such separations had to be more gentle than the strong heat and destructive chemicals that had been considered adequate up to then. The interpretation of the new results naturally relied on the general advance of chemistry, the development of new methods for isolating substances of little stability, of new concepts concerning the arrangements of atoms in the molecules, and of new apparatus to measure their rates of change.  In the system of chemistry, as it developed in the first half of the 19th century, the new development can be characterized as the turn from inorganic to organic phosphates, from the substance of minerals and strong chemical interactions to the components in which phosphate groups remained combined with carbon-containing substances.
