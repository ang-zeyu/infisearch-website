I have looked through the magnificent works     of Lepsius and Rosellini, and on the Egyptian monuments from the     fourth to the twelfth dynasties (i.e. from about 3400 B.C. to 2100      B.C.) several varieties of the dog are represented; most of them     are allied to greyhounds; at the later of these periods a dog     resembling a hound is figured, with drooping ears, but with a     longer back and more pointed head than in our hounds. There is,     also, a turnspit, with short and crooked legs, closely resembling     the existing variety; but this kind of monstrosity is so common     with various animals, as with the ancon sheep, and even, according     to Rengger, with jaguars in Paraguay, that it would be rash to look     at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits:     Colonel Sykes[5] also has described an Indian pariah dog as     presenting the same monstrous character. The most ancient dog     represented on the Egyptian monuments is one of the most singular;     it resembles a greyhound, but has long pointed ears and a short     curled tail: a closely allied variety still exists in Northern     Africa; for Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt[6] states that the Arab     boar-hound is “an eccentric hieroglyphic animal, such as Cheops     once hunted with, somewhat resembling the rough Scotch deer-hound;     their tails are curled tight round on their backs, and their ears     stick out at right angles.” With this most ancient variety a     pariah-like dog coexisted.      We thus see that, at a period between four and five thousand years     ago, various breeds, viz. pariah dogs, greyhounds, common hounds,     mastiffs, house-dogs, lapdogs, and turnspits, existed, more or less     closely resembling our present breeds. But there is not sufficient     evidence that any of these ancient dogs belonged to the same     identical sub-varieties with our present dogs.[7] As long as man     was believed to have existed on this earth only about 6000 years,     this fact of the great diversity of the breeds at so early a period     was an argument of much weight that they had proceeded from several     wild sources, for there would not have been sufficient time for     their divergence and modification. But now that we know, from the     discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of extinct     animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical     changes, that man has existed for an incomparably longer period,     and bearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess     domestic dogs, the argument from insufficient time falls away     greatly in value.      Long before the period of any historical record the dog was     domesticated in Europe. In the Danish Middens of the Neolithic or     Newer Stone period, bones of a canine animal are embedded, and     Steenstrup ingeniously argues that these belonged to a domestic     dog; for a very large proportion of the bones of birds preserved in     the refuse consists of long bones, which it was found on trial dogs     cannot devour.[8] This ancient dog was succeeded in Denmark during     the Bronze period by a larger kind, presenting certain differences,     and this again during the Iron period, by a still larger kind. In     Switzerland, we hear from Prof. Rütimeyer,[9] that during the     Neolithic period a domesticated dog of middle size existed, which     in its skull was about equally remote from the wolf and jackal, and     partook of the characters of our hounds and setters or spaniels     (Jagdhund und Wachtelhund). Rütimeyer insists strongly on the     constancy of form during a very long period of time of this the     most ancient known dog. During the Bronze period a larger dog     appeared, and this closely resembled in its jaw a dog of the same     age in Denmark. Remains of two notably distinct varieties of the     dog were found by Schmerling in a cave;[10] but their age cannot be     positively determined.      The existence of a single race, remarkably constant in form during     the whole Neolithic period, is an interesting fact in contrast with     what we see of the changes which the races underwent during the     period of the successive Egyptian monuments, and in contrast with     our existing dogs. The character of this animal during the     Neolithic period, as given by Rütimeyer, supports De Blainville’s     view that our varieties have descended from an unknown and extinct     form. But we should not forget that we know nothing with respect to     the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the world. The     succession of the different kinds of dogs in Switzerland and     Denmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering     tribes bringing with them their dogs; and this view accords with     the belief that different wild canine animals were domesticated in     different regions. Independently of the immigration of new races of     man, we know from the wide-spread presence of bronze, composed of     an alloy of tin, how much commerce there must have been throughout     Europe at an extremely remote period, and dogs would then probably     have been bartered. At the present time, amongst the savages of the     interior of Guiana, the Taruma Indians are considered the best     trainers of dogs, and possess a large breed which they barter at a     high price with other tribes.[11]      The main argument in favour of the several breeds of the dog being     the descendants of distinct wild stocks, is their resemblance in     various countries to distinct species still existing there. It     must, however, be admitted that the comparison between the wild and     domesticated animal has been made but in few cases with sufficient     exactness. Before entering on details, it will be well to show that     there is no a priori difficulty in the belief that several canine     species have been domesticated. Members of the dog family inhabit     nearly the whole world; and several species agree pretty closely in     habits and structure with our several domesticated dogs. Mr. Galton     has shown[12] how fond savages are of keeping and taming animals of     all kinds. Social animals are the most easily subjugated by man,     and several species of Canidæ hunt in packs. It deserves notice, as     bearing on other animals as well as on the dog, that at an     extremely ancient period, when man first entered any country, the     animals living there would have felt no instinctive or inherited     fear of him, and would consequently have been tamed far more easily     than at present. For instance, when the Falkland Islands were first     visited by man, the large wolf-like dog (_Canis antarcticus_)     fearlessly came to meet Byron’s sailors, who, mistaking this     ignorant curiosity for ferocity, ran into the water to avoid them:     even recently a man, by holding a piece of meat in one hand and a     knife in the other, could sometimes stick them at night. On a     island in the Sea of Aral, when first discovered by Butakoff, the     saigak antelopes, which are “generally very timid and watchful, did     not fly from us, but on the contrary looked at us with a sort of     curiosity.” So, again, on the shores of the Mauritius, the manatee     was not at first in the least afraid of man, and thus it has been     in several quarters of the world with seals and the morse. I have     elsewhere shown[13] how slowly the native birds of several islands     have acquired and inherited a salutary dread of man: at the     Galapagos Archipelago I pushed with the muzzle of my gun hawks from     a branch, and held out a pitcher of water for other birds to alight     on and drink. Quadrupeds and birds which have seldom been disturbed     by man, dread him no more than do our English birds, the cows, or     horses grazing in the fields.  It is a more important consideration that several canine species evince (as will be shown in a future chapter) no strong repugnance or inability to breed under confinement; and the incapacity to breed under confinement is one of the commonest bars to domestication. Lastly, savages set the highest value, as we shall see in the chapter on Selection, on dogs: even half-tamed animals are highly useful to them: the Indians of North America cross their half-wild dogs with wolves, and thus render them even wilder than before, but bolder: the savages of Guiana catch and partially tame and use the whelps of two wild species of _Canis,_ as do the savages of Australia those of the wild Dingo. Mr. Philip King informs me that he once trained a wild Dingo puppy to drive cattle, and found it very useful. From these several considerations we see that there is no difficulty in believing that man might have domesticated various canine species in different countries. It would indeed have been a strange fact if one species alone had been domesticated throughout the world.      We will now enter into details. The accurate and sagacious     Richardson says, “The resemblance between the Northern American     wolves (_Canis lupus,_ var. _occidentalis_) and the domestic dogs     of the Indians is so great that the size and strength of the wolf     seems to be the only difference. I have more than once mistaken a     band of wolves for the dogs of a party of Indians; and the howl of     the animals of both species is prolonged so exactly in the same key     that even the practised ear of the Indian fails at times to     discriminate them.” He adds that the more northern Esquimaux dogs     are not only extremely like the grey wolves of the Arctic circle in     form and colour, but also nearly equal them in size. Dr. Kane has     often seen in his teams of sledge-dogs the oblique eye (a character     on which some naturalists lay great stress), the drooping tail, and     scared look of the wolf.

In them days when a feller says he is feeling like a king, it meant that he was feeling like a king, _aber_ to-day yet, if a feller says he feels like a king it means that he's got stomach and domestic trouble and that he don't know where the money is coming from to pay his next week's laundry bill. Czars is the same way, too. Former times when you called a feller a regular czar you meant he was a regular czar, _aber_ nowadays if you say somebody is a regular czar it means that the poor feller couldn't call his soul his own and that he must got to do what everybody from the shipping-clerk up tells him to do with no back talk.\"  \"Well, it only goes to show, Mawruss,\" Abe commented. \"There was a czar, y'understand, which for years was not only making out pretty good as a czar, y'understand, but had really as you might say been doing something phenomenal yet. In fact, Mawruss, if three years ago R.G. Dun or Bradstreet would give it a rating to czars and people in similar lines, y'understand, compared with the czar already, an old-established house like Hapsburg's in Vienna would be rated N. to Q., Credit Four, see foot-note. And to-day, Mawruss, where _is_ he?\"  \"Say,\" Morris protested, \"any one could have reverses, Abe, because it don't make no difference if it would be a czar _oder_ a pants manufacturer, and they both had ratings like John B. Rockafellar even, along comes two or three bad seasons like the czar had it, y'understand, and the most you could hope for would be thirty cents on the dollar--ten cents cash and the balance in notes at three, six, and nine months, indorsed by a grand duke who has got everything he owns in his wife's name and 'ain't spent an evening at home with her since way before the Crimean War already.\"  \"What happened to the Czar, Mawruss,\" Abe said, \"bad seasons didn't done it. Not reckoning quick assets, like crowns actually in stock, fixtures, etc., the feller must of owned a couple million _versts_ high-grade real property, to say nothing of his life insurance, Mawruss.\"  [Illustration: \"I bet yer over half a czar's morning mail already is circulars from casket concerns alone, Abe.\"]  \"Czars and life insurance ain't in the same dictionary at all, Abe,\" Morris interrupted. \"In the insurance business, Abe, czars comes under the same head as aviators with heart trouble, y'understand. I bet yer over half a czar's morning mail already is circulars from casket concerns alone, Abe, so that only goes to show how much you know from czars.\"  \"Well, I know this much, anyhow,\" Abe continued. \"What put the Czar out of business, didn't happen this season or last season neither, Mawruss. It dates back already twenty years ago, which you can take it from me, Mawruss, it don't make no difference what line a feller would be in--czars wholesale, czars retail, or czars' supplies and sundries, including bombproof underwear and the Little Wonder Poison Detector, y'understand, the moment such a feller marries into the family of his nearest competitor, Mawruss, he might just as well go down to a lawyer's office and hand him the names he wants inserted in Schedule A Three of his petition in bankruptcy.\"  \"Did the Czar marry into such a family?\" Morris asked.  \"A question!\" Abe exclaimed. \"Didn't you know that the Czar's wife is the Kaiser's mother's sister's daughter?\"  \"Say!\" Morris retorted. \"I didn't even know that the Kaiser _had_ a mother. From the heart that feller's got it, you might suppose he was raised in an incubator and that the only parents he ever knew was a couple of packages absorbent cotton and an alcohol-lamp.\"  \"Well, that's what I am telling you, Mawruss,\" Abe said. \"With all the millionaires in Russland which would be tickled to pieces to get a czar for a son-in-law, y'understand, the feller goes to work and ties up to a family with somebody like the Kaiser in it, and you know as well as I do, Mawruss, one crook in your wife's family can stick you worser than all your poor relations put together.\"  \"Even when your wife's relations are honest, what _is_ it?\" Morris asked.  \"_Gewiss!_\" Abe agreed. \"And can you imagine when such a crook _in_-law is also your biggest competitor?
