By June 8 all the eggs had hatched and the tadpoles were active. On August 28 and 29 thousands of newly metamorphosed young were in evidence on wet soil at the pond margin; in some the head still was tadpolelike and they had a vestige of the tail stump. These young were remarkably uniform in size, 15 to 16 mm. (the smallest one found was 14½ mm.) and almost all of them had originated from eggs laid after heavy precipitation, totalling 3.22 inches, in the first 36 hours of August. Allowing one day for adults to reach the pond and spawn, and two days more for eggs to hatch, the tadpole stage must have lasted approximately 24 days in this crop of young.  Wright and Wright (1949: 582) stated that the tadpoles metamorphosed after 30 to 50 days, and that the newly metamorphosed frogs are 10 to 12 mm. in length. Length of time required for larval development probably varies a great deal depending on the interaction of several factors such as temperature and food supply.   GROWTH  Little has been recorded concerning the growth rate of _Gastrophryne_ or the time required for it to attain sexual maturity. Wright (1932) found that _G. carolinensis_ in the Okefinokee Swamp region has a mean metamorphosing-size of 10.8 mm. Young thought to be those recently emerged from their first hibernation were those in the size group 15.0 to 20.0 mm., while the frogs in the 20 to 27 mm. size class and those in the 27 to 36 mm. class were interpreted as representing two successively older annual age classes. Anderson (1954: 41) thought he could recognize four successive annual age classes in the same species in southern Louisiana. He found that sexual maturity is attained at a length of 21 to 24 mm. in frogs which he believed to be late in the second year of life.  Allowing for size differences between the two species, Wright's and Anderson's conclusions regarding growth in _G. carolinensis_, on the basis of size groups, are largely substantiated by my own data on the growth of marked individuals of _G. olivacea_ living under natural conditions in Kansas.  In 1954, an opportunity to investigate the early growth was afforded by unusually favorable circumstances. The population of frogs that emerged from hibernation in the late spring of 1954 included few, if any, that were below adult size; drought had prevented successful breeding in 1952 and 1953. Heavy rains in the first week of June, 1954, and again in the first week of August, resulted in the production of two successive crops of young so widely spaced that they were easily distinguishable. Some young may have been hatched after other minor rains, but certainly these were relatively few. Young from the eggs laid in the first week of August were metamorphosing during the last week of August. Growth in the frogs of this group can be shown by the average size and the size range of the successive samples collected.  TABLE 2. GROWTH IN FROGS METAMORPHOSED IN THE LAST WEEK OF AUGUST, 1954.    =========================================================                       |Number in|   Mean size  |Size range    Time of sample     | sample  |    in mm.    |  in mm.   --------------------+---------+--------------+-----------   August 27 to 31     |   27    | 15.55 ± .079 | 15 to 17   --------------------+---------+--------------+-----------   September 11        |  114    | 17.2  ± .033 | 14 to 20   --------------------+---------+--------------+-----------   September 15 to 22  |   12    | 18.7  ± .090 | 16 to 20   --------------------+---------+--------------+-----------   September 27 to 30  |   37    | 19.3  ± .055 | 17 to 21.5   --------------------+---------+--------------+-----------   October 1 to 7      |   62    | 20.8  ± .072 | 17 to 24   --------------------+---------+--------------+-----------   October 12 to 17    |   49    | 22.3  ± .092 | 18 to 24   =========================================================  By mid-October, six weeks after metamorphosis, these frogs had increased in over-all length by approximately 50 percent. Having grown a little more than 1 mm. per week on the average, they were approximately intermediate in size between small adults and newly metamorphosed young.  The frogs hatched in June were present in relatively small numbers compared with those hatched in August, and were not observed metamorphosing. In late August a sample of 33 judged to belong to the June brood averaged 26.2 (22-28) mm. long. A sample of 39 from the first week of October averaged 28.1 (24.5-32) mm. Frogs of this group thus were approaching small adult size late in their first growing season. Such individuals possibly breed in the summer following their first hibernation, when they are a year old or a little more. Because recaptured frogs were not sacrificed to determine the state of their gonads, the minimum time required to attain sexual maturity was not definitely determined. The available evidence indicates that sexual maturity is most often attained late in the second year of life, at an age of approximately two years. The darkened and distensible throat pouch of the adult male probably is the best available indicator of sexual maturity.  [Illustration: FIG. 3. Growth shown by successive samples of young ant-eating frogs of two size groups in late summer and early fall of 1954. For each sample the mean, standard deviation, and range are shown. Lower series are those metamorphosed in late August, and upper series are those metamorphosed in late June.]  [Illustration: FIG. 4. Rapid growth of a young female caught in June, July, and August, 1949. Presumably this individual metamorphosed late in the summer of 1948, and at the age of approximately one year it was near small adult size.]  Frogs that metamorphose in late summer have little time to grow before hibernating, and still are small when they emerge in spring. The smallest one found was 19 mm. long (May 19, 1951), and in each year except 1954 many such young were found that were less than 25 mm. in length in May or early June. None of the frogs marked at or near metamorphosing size has been recaptured, but the trend of early growth is well shown by Table 2 and Fig. 3. However, many juveniles that were captured and marked within a few weeks of metamorphosis were recaptured as adults. The selected individuals in Table 3 are considered typical of growth from \"half-grown\" to small adult size. Growth in many other individuals is shown in Figs. 6 and 7.  TABLE 3.

Ant-eating frogs, a little less than twice natural size, adult and newly metamorphosed young, showing differences in size and coloration. The young is darker and has a leaflike middorsal mark which fades as growth proceeds.]  The trend of growth after attainment of minimum adult size is also well shown by the records of marked individuals recaptured. Many of these were marked while they were still small so that their approximate ages are known. For those recaptured in their second year, after one hibernation, length averaged 30.92 mm. Some of this group were young metamorphosed late the preceding summer and still far short of adult size (as small as 23 mm.) when recaptured. Others were relatively large, up to 33 mm. A group of 22 recaptured frogs known to be in their third year averaged 33.3 mm. (males 31.9, females 35.3, excluding four individuals of undetermined sex). Fifteen other recaptured frogs were known to be in their fourth year at least, and some probably were older, as they were already large adults when first examined. These 15 averaged 36.6 mm. (males 34.7, females 37.9 mm.). Size was similar in a sample of 58 individuals intercepted en route to the breeding pond in heavy rains of June and August, 1954. The 38 males in this sample ranged in size from 30 mm. to 38 mm., averaging 34.5. The 20 females ranged from 34 mm. to 40 mm., averaging 37.65. The large average and maximum size in this sample of a breeding population may be typical after periods of drought years have prevented successful reproduction. Summer drought in 1952 and 1953 prevented breeding in those years, or, at least, it drastically reduced the numbers of young produced. One-year-old and two-year-old frogs may not have been represented at all in the sample of 58. Three-year-old frogs presumably made up a substantial part of the sample, since 1951 was a year of successful breeding.  [Illustration: FIG. 6. Growth in a group of frogs, each marked while still short of adult size and mostly recaptured after lapse of one or more hibernation periods. Each line connects records of an individual frog.]  Differences in size between species and geographic variation in size in _Gastrophryne_ have been given little attention by herpetologists, but if understood, would help to clarify relationships."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33574"],["title","A Field Study of the Kansas Ant-Eating Frog, Gastrophryne olivacea (#4)"],["body","and Matalas stated in their revision (1946: 5) that size is of no importance as a taxonomic character, as typical _carolinensis_, _olivacea_, and _mazatlanensis_ all averaged approximately the same--26 to 28 mm.--females slightly larger than males. However, they arbitrarily classed as adults all individuals 22.5 mm. in length or larger, having found individuals this small that showed the darkened and distensible throat pouches characteristic of adult males. From the trend of my own measurements of _G. olivacea_ in northeastern Kansas, I conclude that either many immature individuals were included in their samples, or that the populations sampled included some with individuals that were remarkably small as adults.  [Illustration: FIG. 7. Growth in another group of frogs that were marked as young or small adults and recaptured after intervals of more than a year. Frogs of this group were, on the average, larger than the individuals shown in Fig. 6, and they made less rapid growth.]  The population which I studied may be considered typical of _G. olivacea_. They averaged large, including individuals up to 42 mm. in length, well above the maximum sizes for any reported in the literature. At metamorphosis these _olivacea_ are of approximately 50 percent greater length than _G. carolinensis_ as reported by Wright and Wright (1949: 573) and Anderson (1954: 41). Yet Blair (1950: 152) observed that in eastern Oklahoma, where the ranges of _olivacea_ and _carolinensis_ overlap, the latter is larger. On the basis of field and laboratory observations he tentatively concluded that one of the main barriers to interbreeding was the reluctance of the males of _carolinensis_ to clasp the smaller females of _olivacea_.  That size differs in different populations, and is still poorly understood, is illustrated by the following discrepant figures from various authors.  TABLE 4.

At the time of metamorphosis, young are dark brown with specks of black and with a dark, cuneate, leaflike middorsal mark. The narrow end of this mark arises just behind the head, and the mark extends posteriorly as far as the hind leg insertions. At its widest, the mark covers about half the width of the dorsal surface. The lateral edges of the mark are sharply defined, but at its anterior and posterior ends it blends into the ground color. In most individuals smaller than 20 mm., this dorsal mark is well defined and conspicuous. As growth proceeds, however, it becomes faint. In frogs 19 to 25 mm. long the marks have disappeared. In individuals of this size the brown ground color is markedly paler than in those newly metamorphosed, but is darker than in adults.  In large adults the dorsal coloration is a uniform pale tan, paler on the average in females than in males. Temperature and moisture both affect the shade of coloration. In frogs that were partly desiccated, the color was unusually pale, with a distinctly greenish tint, and at high temperatures coloration tended to be relatively pale.  Hecht and Matalas (1946) have described and figured color patterns in various populations of _Gastrophryne_, demonstrating geographic trends and helping to clarify relationships. Their account indicates that the dark dorsal mark present in young of _olivacea_ but not present in adults, is better developed and longer persisting in other forms. Specimens of _carolinensis_, presumably adult, are figured which have the dark middorsal area contrasting with paler color of the sides. The dark area is seen to consist of dots or blotches of black pigment which may be in contact producing more or less continuous black areas, or may be separate and distinct producing a spotted pattern. Pigmentation is usually most intense along the lateral edges of the dorsal leaflike mark; the central portion may be so much paler that the effect is that of a pair of dorsolateral stripes. This latter type of pattern is best developed in the population of Key West, Florida. Hecht and Matalas did not consider these insular frogs to be taxonomically distinct, because only 48 percent of specimens from the Florida keys had the \"Key West\" pattern, while 29 per cent resembled _olivacea_ and 23 per cent resembled _carolinensis_. In the southwestern subspecies (or species) _mazatlanensis_, recorded from several localities in Sonora and from extreme southern Arizona, the dorsal pigmentation similarly tends to be concentrated in dorsolateral bands, but is much reduced or almost absent, and there is corresponding pigmentation dorsally across the middle of the thigh, across the middle of the shank, and on the foot. When the leg is folded, these three dark areas are brought in contact with each other and with the dorsolateral body mark, if it is present, to form a continuous dark area, in a characteristic \"ruptive\" pattern. Hecht and Matalas found similar leg bars, less well developed, in certain specimens of _olivacea_ including one from Gage County, Nebraska, at the northern end of the known geographic range.   MOVEMENTS  Freiburg (_op. cit._: 384) concluded that ant-eating frogs seem to have no individual home ranges, but wander in any direction where suitable habitat is present. However, from records covering a much longer span of time, it became increasingly evident that a frog ordinarily tends to stay within a small area, familiar to it and providing its habitat requirements.  Nevertheless, in all but a few instances the marked frogs recaptured were in new locations a greater or lesser distance from the site of original capture. The movements made by these frogs were of several distinct types:    1. Routine day to day movements from shelter to shelter within      the area familiar to the animal, the \"home range.\"    2. Shifts from one home range to another; such shifts may have      been either long or short, and may have occurred abruptly or      by gradual stages.    3. Travel by adults to or from a breeding pond. In most or all      instances these adults were regularly established in permanent      home ranges, and they often moved through areas unsuitable      as habitat to reach the ponds.    4. Movements of dispersal in the young, recently metamorphosed      and not yet settled in a regular home range.  Usually there was uncertainty as to which types of movements had been made by the recaptured individuals. Some may have made two or three different types of movements in the interval between captures.  On many occasions individuals were found beneath the same rock on two consecutive days, or occasionally on several successive days. Rarely, such continued occupancy of a niche lasted several weeks. In 1949, a frog was found under the same rock on June 4, 6, 26, 27, and July 1, 3 and 11. This was an immature female, presumably metamorphosed late in the summer of 1948. During the five weeks period covered by the records, it grew from 27 mm. to 34 mm. In 1952, another individual was found under its home rock on June 23 and 30, July 2 and 3, and August 14 and 20. In 1952 a juvenile was found under a rock on May 30, June 4, and June 17. These three individuals were exceptional in their continued occupancy of the same niches. Among the hundreds of others recorded, none was found more than twice in any one place.  Despite the fact that field work was concentrated on small areas which were worked intensively, only eight per cent of the frogs recorded were ever recaptured, and most of those were recaptured only once. Only 13 individuals yielded series of records, well spaced, in two or more different years. These few individuals recaptured frequently may not be typical of the entire population. The low incidence of recaptures indicates that relatively few of the frogs present on an area at any one time have been taken. Because of their secretive and subterranean habits most of the frogs are missed by a collector who searches by turning rocks, or trapping with pitfalls. Therefore, even though a marked frog may survive and remain within a radius of a few hundred feet of one point for months or even years, the chances of recapture are poor.  One female was"]]]
